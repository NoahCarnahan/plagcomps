in its train all over the scene of action. But some positive good came out of it as well, both
in Canada and in the United States.

77. In distributing the Petty Officers, Seamen, and others to the guns and other stations in
the several divisions, it is desirable, as a general rule, that those stationed at the same
gun or near each other at quarters, should be drawn from different stations for working ship;
so that a great loss at any one gun may not fall too heavily on any watch station.

their habitual attendance on particular decks. In such cases it will generally be advisable

port watch even numbers, as 2, 4, 6.

There is a cave under the highest butte of the Squaw Peak range, Arizona, where a party of
Tonto Indians was found by white men in 1868. The white men were on the war-path, and when
the Tontos fell into their hands they shot them unhesitatingly, firing into the dark recesses
of the cavern, the fitful but fast-recurring flashes of their rifles illuminating the interior
and exposing to view the objects of their hatred.

seemed to come out of the earth, but that really came from the toad, asked him if he wished
to destroy the giants. He desired nothing so much. "Then take my horned crest for a helmet."

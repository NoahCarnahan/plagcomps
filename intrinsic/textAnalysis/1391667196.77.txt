TO THE GIRLS OF KEEWAYDIN CAMP FIRE OF CLEVELAND AND ICACAYA CAMP FIRE OF BOSTON

This is an atom: 
FOREWORD

This is an atom: 
"Given a Camp-fire, a group of friendly girls and a good story-teller who knows and loves the
girls, and the ideals of a whole community may be lifted in a night."

This is an atom: 
The teen age girl is a great problem and at the same time a great opportunity. Her ideals seem
low, yet there is no time in her life when she will more gladly follow a great ideal. She seems
fickle, yet she is putting her friends to a test that is most worth while. She is misunderstood
and she can not understand herself. She is searching for something, yet she does not know what
it is.

This is an atom: 
Her problems are many, and most of them she must solve alone. If she follows the crowd and
goes in the way of least resistance, there is a big chance that she will fall by the way. If
she does not follow the crowd, it is because somewhere, some time, she has found a compelling
ideal and is following it. Sometimes that ideal comes to her in the form of a friend. Sometimes
she is fortunate enough to have found that ideal in her mother. But often and often it comes
to her through a little story that lives with her, and works for her, and helps her to hold
to the best, in spite of the manifold temptations to do otherwise.

This is an atom: 
Recently I met a young woman whom I had seen only once and that was twelve years ago. She came
to me after a service and said, "Will you tell Van Dyke's 'Lump of Clay' to-night? Twelve years
ago I heard you tell it. I was so discouraged at the time, for everything seemed going wrong
and life seemed so useless. But I dropped into a church and heard you tell the story. You have
no idea what it has done for me. I am teaching in the college near by and I should like to
have my girls hear the story. Perhaps they need it as I did."

This is an atom: 
Many of the workers with girls have seen this need and have wanted to meet it and yet have
been unable to find the story that was needed by the girl. It is because of this very need
in my own work that I am sending out these stories, most of which I have told over and over
to my girls. Many of them have been written because of special problems that needed to be met--problems
peculiar to adolescence--problems found in every class and club of girls the country over.

This is an atom: 
The stories are not to amuse, for we have no time to amuse girls in the story hour. We have
little enough time, at the best, for implanting ideals and every story hour should leave a
vital message. That is the thing the girls want and why should we give them less.

This is an atom: 
The stories are not to be read. They need the personal touch, the sympathetic voice, the freedom
of eye that tells the story-teller which girls are finding the message of the story. Some of
them will hurt--but experience has shown me that these are the very ones that one has to tell
over and over. Can you imagine the Master reading to the groups gathered about him the stories
that you and I love to read in his word? When you go into the heart life of a girl, let all
your personality help you to carry the message. It was the Master's way of story-telling.

This is an atom: 
"'Twas only a little story,
                  Yet it came like a ray of light;
                  And it gave to the girl who heard it
                  Real courage to do the right."

FIRESIDE STORIES FOR GIRLS IN THEIR TEENS

This is an atom: 
I WOULD BE TRUE

This is an atom: 
'Twas a beautiful day in the late fall and the roadside was lined with the late asters and
goldenrod. The sun was shining so brightly and the sky was as blue as a New Hampshire sky could
be, yet the girl, walking along the winding, climbing road, saw none of them. The little brook
by the roadside whispered and chattered as it ran along, yet she did not hear; a few late birds
still twittered to her from the trees, but she did not notice; a chipmunk called to her from
a dead tree by the roadside, but she paid not the least attention. She was alone with her thoughts
and they were far from pleasant.

This is an atom: 
How different it all seemed from what it had seemed six months before! Then she had stood in
the office of a great doctor in Philadelphia and heard him say to her father, "Unless you leave
the city at once and go where there is pure air and simple food and real quiet, there is no
help for you."

This is an atom: 
The father had looked at the doctor for a moment in silence and then answered, "Well, if that
is the case, I am sorry, for I cannot leave the city. My business needs me; Katherine is in
college and she must be here. I shall stay."

This is an atom: 
But with flashing eyes the girl had stepped to the doctor and said, "Father is mistaken, doctor.
His business can do without him and there is no need at all why he should stay here for me.
There is a dear little old place in the hills of New Hampshire that belongs to us, where grandfather
used to live. We can go there and have all the things that you have said he must have. You
may leave the matter with me. We shall be out of the city within two weeks."

This is an atom: 
Then turning to her father she had put her arms about his neck and said, "Of course we can
go, daddy, for what is college and money and friends compared with your health? And when we
arrived, we found all the people from the IDA, i burned the houses, i much corn, i Calabaças,
i Frisoles that ia all was to get started.

This is an atom: 
Rested two days, i passed them, the Governor was asked to me to discover the Sea, as the Indians
say, that was so close to there: the AI in this way discovered by Havi vn mui grande Rio, in the
hall, Havi whom post on behalf of the Rio Magdalena.
And outside the home--oh,
there were the most wonderful things to see. The trailing arbutus trailed everywhere; the lady
slippers grew even in the front dooryard. The old trees in the yard were soon filled with nesting
birds; the apple and pear trees in bloom were a sight never to be forgotten.

This is an atom: 
So the days fled by and the little family under the hill were so happy to see the color coming
back to the face of the sick one and the smile once more on his face. Katherine loved it all--the
home--the flowers--the mountains and even the quiet of the little hamlet.

This is an atom: 
Then the summer had come and with it the stream of visitors who come every year to the New
Hampshire mountains. Within a short distance of the home were large hotels, and the guests
soon learned of the cool water in the well in front of the house; of the father who was such
a pleasant companion; of the pretty girl who could sing, and climb, and play so well. So there
had been picnics, and parties, and auto rides, and the summer had fled.

This is an atom: 
And when the people had gone, there were the wonderful colors in the trees, the gorgeous sunsets
in the sky, the fun of the harvest time and still the life in the country was full of wonder
and satisfaction.

This is an atom: 
But now--oh, now the days had begun to grow cold, the trees were bare, the birds had flown
to the south, and her friends had all gone away. Here and there a family was left in the farmhouses
that dotted the little, winding road but none of them were people for whom she cared. And so
as the days had come and gone, there had crept into the heart of the girl a loneliness that
would not be forced down, a longing that she could not stifle, a dissatisfaction that grew
with the days.

This is an atom: 
How could she pass the long winter nights that were ahead? How could she stay away from the
friends who were gathering at the college? How could she live without her piano? How could
she keep a smile so that the dear ones at home would not see how unhappy she was becoming?
The house seemed so big and bare; the trees in the yard seemed to sigh instead of sing; the
way ahead seemed full of blackness. She longed for all that had gone; she longed for her friends,
especially the one who had been her ideal during her college days; she longed to run back to
him for always.

This is an atom: 
But on this October morning, she had risen early to keep the quiet hour before the rest were
up. Usually she read in the gospels, but this morning her Bible opened to the Psalms and she
read, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from
the Lord who made heaven and earth." She stopped and looked from the window at Mt. Kearsarge
in the distance.

This is an atom: 
Then she read again, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help."
"Ah!" said the girl, "I need help. God knows I need help. I wonder if there is any help for
me. 'I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help.' Perhaps if I should
go out into the hills for the day, God would help me. I think I will try it."

This is an atom: 
To the mother she had said, "I think I should like to go for a long walk to-day if you do not
mind. I feel like having a tramp," and then with lunch box in hand and book under her arm,
she had started.

This is an atom: 
As long as father and mother could see, she had smiled and waved to them, but when the turn
in the road had come, the light faded from her eyes and her problem was still before her. The
night before had been endless, yet there were longer ones to come. No wonder she saw no sunshine,
heard no bird and saw no brook as she walked along the country road.

This is an atom: 
On and on she went; mile after mile was put behind her, till the sun was high in the heaven
and she was weary and hungry. Then a sudden turn in the road brought her to the foot of a little
lake--one of those mountain lakes that make New Hampshire so beautiful. All around it were
hills; the water was very, very blue and its surface was as calm as could be. A moss-covered
stone was very near and the girl sank beside it and, leaning her head on her hand, she looked
at the quiet waters.

This is an atom: 
"Ah!" she said to herself, "how I wish my life were as calm as the lake. One would never dream
that it ever were rough and troubled. I wish God could send peace to me as He sends it to the
little lake."

This is an atom: 
Her eyes wandered to the shores and then to the hills about the lake. How beautiful the tall
pines and spruces were! How fragrant the resinous balsams! How bleak and cold the trees with
no leaves!

This is an atom: 
Then her eyes turned to the top of the hills when suddenly--it seemed as if by magic--there
stood out before her, as if outlined in the sky, the giant face of a man. What could it be?
Had it been carved there? How strong and noble the face seemed to be! How had it come to be
there at the very top of the hill? Then she remembered a story she had heard when first she
had come to the valley. This must be the "Old Man of the Mountain." For centuries and centuries
he had stood here guarding the little lake.

This is an atom: 
When the wonder of finding the Great Stone Face had passed by, she studied it. The forehead
was high and the face of noble mien. The mouth showed much of strength. It was a face one would
like to see often. God had put it there--the God who made the heaven and earth. Then there
came to her mind again the verse of the morning, "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from
whence cometh my help." Perhaps the Old Man of the Mountain could help her. He had stood here
for years and years. He must know what it meant to be weary with the long days and the longer
nights. He must have seen the multitude pass by and still leave him in the mountains. Perhaps
he would understand how lonely and full of unrest she was.

This is an atom: 
So leaning her head on the moss-covered stone, she said dreamily, "Old Man of the Mountains,
if you were I and were longing to go back to your work and your friends, if you were afraid
of the long winter that is coming, if you had a duty to do right here when you longed to be
there, if you had a father who needed you and a mother who is brave as can be, and still there
burned within you the longing to get back to the others, what would you do? Are you never weary
with it all? Do you never long to run away from your task that God has given you to do? Are
you never discontented? Oh, Old Man of the Mountain, if you were I and had my burden to carry,
what would you do?"

This is an atom: 
A silence was everywhere as she listened for his answer. Not a bird sang, not a ripple crossed
the lake. For a moment she watched the face--then another, and then she was sure that she saw
the face begin to relax. A sign of a twinkle came across the great stone eyes and the lips
smiled as there came to her heart this answer:

This is an atom: 
"Oh, little girl from the city with a burden to carry! What would I do if I had a father who
was surely growing strong and a mother who had smiled through the days of the sickness? What
would I do if I longed to go back to the life of pleasure and happiness when my duty lay here?
What would I do if I had forgotten the books that might be read during the long winter nights
for which there had been no time in the city; the lessons of patience and loyalty that might
be learned in doing the hard thing; the happiness of really being needed? What would I do if
I were you and were lonely and discouraged and heartsick?

This is an atom: 
I would be true, for there are those that trust me;
          I would be pure, for there are those who care;
          I would be strong, for there is much to suffer;
          I would be brave, for there is much to dare.

This is an atom: 
I would be friend of all--the foe, the friendless;
          I would be giving, and forget the gift;
          I would be humble, for I know my weakness;
          I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift.[A]

This is an atom: 
"Aye, little girl from the city, I would go back into the little home under the hill with all
its comfort, and home-likeness, and wealth of love, and I would look up to God for help; I
would laugh at the hard things and help them to vanish from sight; I would love the dear ones
who are dearer to you than life itself; and I would lift, not only their burden, but that of
others who need you in this beautiful valley."

This is an atom: 
Slowly the face was again set into the lines that others saw and the head of the girl dropped
deeper into the moss. For a long time there was no sign that she had heard. Then she lifted
a face, full of light, to that of the Old Man of the Mountain.

This is an atom: 
"Thank you, my friend," she said. "I have lifted my eyes unto the hills and help has come.
I will go back to the little white house and, with God's help, I will look up, and I will laugh,
and I will love, and I will lift."

This is an atom: 
So she ate her lunch by the calm, little mountain lake and the tiny breezes whispered in her
ears. Then she walked again the winding road that led down to the home. But the sky was blue
and full of beauty; the birds heard an answering call; the little brook gave her to drink,
and the chipmunk found on his stump a little piece of the cake from the box. Her face was smiling
and her heart full of courage, for she had looked unto the hills--and God had answered.

[A] Poem by Harold Arnold Walter.

This is an atom: 
THE APPEAL TO THE GREAT SPIRIT

This is an atom: 
Owaissa, the Indian Squaw, sat before the tepee watching little Litahni play with the colored
stones. The child was the idol of the tribe, for was not her father the great chief Black Hawk
who had done so much for his people? So, lest anything should happen to the little one, Owaissa
made it her chief task to be where the child was and to teach her the things she wanted her
to know.

This is an atom: 
Three years before, the good missionary who was leaving the encampment had said to Owaissa,
"Soon there will come to your tepee a little child. Should it be a little girl, teach her to
see herself in the things about her, so that the birds, and the trees, and the flowers, and
the winds may all help her to grow true and fine, even as they help the young braves to grow
brave and strong. The girls of your Indian tribes are not given half a chance to see the helpers
all about them. Teach her to see, as I have taught you to see, what a woman can do."

This is an atom: 
And the words of the missionary had burned into the very soul of Owaissa. Her child should
have a chance. So when the little girl had come to her wigwam, she had named her Litahni--a
little light--and she had sought for ways to help her to see what nature meant that man should see.

This is an atom: 
"Catch a little raindrop," she said to the little girl as she played near the wigwam. "Every
raindrop helps some plant, even though it is so little. You are tiny, too, but you can help
every day just as the raindrop does."

This is an atom: 
"See the beautiful sunset," she said to the older girl, as they tramped home from gathering
the wood for the fire. "The colors are creeping all over the sky. We see the sunset here and
we are happy because it is so beautiful, but away over the mountains in the far away the sunset
is just as beautiful and they are happy there as they see it. You can bring happiness, too,
both here and far away, if your life is beautiful.

This is an atom: 
"Listen to the wind in the trees," she said to the girl of fourteen who was eager to do that
which father wanted her to leave undone. "You cannot see the wind, yet it sways the great trees
and sometimes fells them. You can bend the will of the strong men of the tribe but you cannot
do it by talk and by ugly words. Learn to bend by gentleness and quietly. Learn to steal into
their lives as the wind steals through the trees."

This is an atom: 
When the girl was sixteen, the young men of the tribe were beginning to love her and to want
to take her to their wigwams. Then the mother knew she must show her how to choose. So she
sought for ways to help her as they hunted the mountains for the wild berries. Often they sat
by the lakeside for their midday meal. Sometimes it was rough and sometimes calm.

This is an atom: 
"See, daughter," said Owaissa. "The little lake is very rough to-day. Sometimes our lives are
like the little lake. Not always are they calm. Storms sweep over the life. But take the lesson
from the lake. Be beautiful through it all. Down beneath the surface, the water is calm and
untroubled even though the white caps are above."

This is an atom: 
Once they were caught in the mountains in a terrific storm. Litahni crept close to the mother
when the thunder rolled loud and long, but she loved to see the long streaks of lightning flash
across the sky.

This is an atom: 
Then Owaissa said, "The thunder cannot hurt you, dear. Seldom does that which comes with a
big noise do the harm, for one can run from it and be safe. Fear that which comes silently
and swiftly and which strikes at the heart. The lightning yonder is far from us but it may
strike at the heart of a giant pine and fell it to the ground. That which should have stood
long and sturdy is then rendered useless and laid low."

This is an atom: 
With the coming of the winter the good squaw died and there were evil days ahead for the Black
Hawk tribe. They were having quarrels with the white men, and the chief was very busy. So Litahni
was left much alone and the days were long and lonely. Now she was glad for all that her mother
had taught her, for the birds, and the flowers, and the trees, and the animals all helped her
to pass the days and they spoke to her of the things that her mother had taught her. She tried
hard to help her father, and often she knew that she had helped him, but she longed to do more.

This is an atom: 
"No squaw has ever done it, but I believe I can. I shall teach my people to love the white
man's God, for then we should not have wars and quarrels," said the girl.

This is an atom: 
So she taught the little children; she told stories to the squaws and she won the confidence
of the young men of the tribe who would soon be in the council fires. And all the tribe loved
Litahni, the beautiful daughter of Black Hawk and Owaissa.

This is an atom: 
One day, across the plain, there came a white man. He was tall and dark and sturdy-looking.
He had education and he could talk well. Litahni saw much of him for a few days and she came
to honor the white man as she listened to him drive the bargains for the furs and the blankets
and the baskets.

This is an atom: 
Now, as the white man watched the little Indian teacher, he saw how far above the tribe she
was. He loved her pretty face, her sweet way and her gentle spirit. Then the white man wanted
to win the Indian girl. In the far East, he had left a girl who loved him but he wanted the
Indian girl,--so he began silently to make love to her. Of course he knew that her father would
never consent. He knew that he would be driven from the encampment if ever they found what
he was doing, so hastily and quietly he worked to win her.

This is an atom: 
He told her of the wonderful land from which he had come; of the beautiful houses in which
his friends lived; of the lives of ease which they lived; then he told her of his love for
her and begged her to flee with him to his land and his people. To Litahni, it was all so wonderful
that she listened happily. How she would love to see it all! If she went there, she could see
again the missionary of whom the mother had told her so often.

This is an atom: 
And when he had finished, she told him of her dreams--how she wanted to help the tribe to learn
to love the great God, and to make the tribe of Black Hawk the finest tribe in all the land around.

This is an atom: 
But when she, too, had finished, he loved her all the more for her beautiful wish, so he held
her closely to him and said:

This is an atom: 
"But, Litahni, to love and to be loved is a far greater happiness than to lift, or to bend,
or to lead the tribe. Leave that to your father. All these things you can do to me and to my
people. Would you waste your life here on the plains? Think what I can give you. Your mother
longed to go beyond the mountains into the sunrise. Come with me and I will take you there.
To love and to be loved is the best that ever comes into a life. And I love you, Litahni! Why
should you think of your father? He has many things to think of and has little time for you.
I will make you my queen. To-morrow I must go. So to-night, I shall come for my answer after
the sun has set. Meet me, dear, by the giant tree near the spring and we will go together.
The train leaves not long after the sunset and I will have a horse at the spring on which we
can get to the train. Come with me, dear. Forget your people and be my Litahni."

This is an atom: 
There was a noise near by--and the white man was gone. But Litahni sat deep in thought. While
he had been with her, she longed to go with him. But as she sat now and looked down into the
valley at the encampment, she was not so sure. Her mind was all awhirl. Was this the way to
happiness? What would mother have said? She wanted her to have the best, but what was the best?
It was only a few hours till the sunset and what should she do? Was there no one to help her?

This is an atom: 
Suddenly from the roadway below she heard a neigh. It was Fleetfoot, and he was tired of being
tied to a sapling. Now Litahni loved Fleetfoot, her horse, for they had grown up together,
so she hurried to the tree where she had left him, untied his bridle, jumped on his back and
whispered,

This is an atom: 
"Fly, Fleetfoot! Fly into the sunset. Go fast and go far and let me think as we fly."

This is an atom: 
Then the horse sped away toward the north. As they passed the little lake in the valley it
whispered, "Life is not always calm. There must be tempests. But you can be calm in your inner
life and you can be beautiful through it all."

This is an atom: 
Up the hill she went, and as the wind blew over her face it seemed to say, "Why be bent? Why
not bend?" At the top, looking far across a distant plain, her mother's voice seemed to whisper,
"Look far ahead, little girl. Look far ahead. What seems wonderful may prove to be only a shadow."

This is an atom: 
On they flew. The girl's face was flushed and thoughtful. Soon she must turn if she would be
at the meeting place. Where was Fleetfoot taking her? Perhaps he knew best what she should do.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly at a bend in the road Fleetfoot gave a great leap, startling the girl and almost making
her lose her balance. Across the path, a giant tree had been felled by the lightning and there
it lay, prone and helpless.

This is an atom: 
Then she shuddered. "Fear that which comes quickly and silently and which strikes at the heart."
Only a week before she had not known the white man--even now her father did not know that she
knew him. Ought she to be afraid? If she met him, it must be silently, in the cover of the dark.

This is an atom: 
At last Fleetfoot stood, panting and breathless, on the great rock that topped the cliff. Often
had he come here with his mistress, so he waited for her to dismount. The sky was aflame with
color--all red and gold and yellow. Far to the North there were blues and pinks. What a wonderful
sunset it was! Surely it must be the home of a great, great God.

This is an atom: 
Litahni sat motionless for a time, drinking in all the glory of the scene. Then she threw her
arms high over her head and, lifting her face into the sunset, she cried,

This is an atom: 
"Oh, thou Great Spirit to whom my people have always prayed, though they knew thee not as the
great God; oh thou to whom my mother taught me to pray, show me the way to happiness. I would
my life should be as my mother wished it to be--a little light. I would do my best in the right
place. Is love for the white man the way to happiness? Is it the way in which I should go?
Answer as by fire. I beg of thee. Answer me as by fire, oh, thou great God of the Indian."

This is an atom: 
Motionless the horse and his rider stood as the moments passed by, one, two, three. The red
of the sunset enfolded them and God was very near.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly far to the south there rose a tiny black cloud. Very tiny it was, yet it grew and
it grew. It blotted out the red and then the yellow and then the gold, and then the whole sky
was dark and the wind blew chill.

This is an atom: 
Slowly Litahni's arms relaxed and her head fell to the mane of the horse. When she lifted it,
her face looked tired and worn, but over it there was a look of peace. Patting the mane of
the horse, she said:

This is an atom: 
"Thank you for bringing me here, Fleetfoot. The Great Spirit has answered and I shall stay
here with Father and with you. To love selfishly is to blot out all the beautiful. He who would
be my chief must not want me to run away from helping and giving. He must help me to serve
my people. The Great Spirit has answered by fire and I am content. I will stay here and serve
my people in the way my mother taught me to do, and I will wait for the one whom the Great
Spirit will send to me some day to be my Chief."

This is an atom: 
Then slowly Fleetfoot picked his way over the narrow trail in the darkness, and, because it
was late, the white man had come and gone away alone. But Litahni, bending low over the couch
where her father should sleep, smiled as she stretched the skins in place for the night. Even
as the animals had given their skins that her father might be warm, so she was ready to give
her little light to make him happy and comfortable, even as Owaissa, her noble mother, had done.

This is an atom: 
And Litahni was content.

This is an atom: 
A PARABLE OF GIRLHOOD

This is an atom: 
Behold a girl went forth to walk on the highway leading to life. And as she walked there grew
up beneath her feet flowers of every kind and color.

This is an atom: 
"Ah!" she said, "I will gather a sheaf of flowers to carry with me, for then, surely, I shall
be welcome when I come to the gate at the end of this way. I will gather what seemeth to me
to be the most beautiful of all the flowers that grow about me. They shall be my gift to the
one who guards the way."

This is an atom: 
And as she plucked, the one that seemed to be most wonderful was the one most bright, gleaming
yellow as the sun. "It is yellow like gold," she said. "If I come with the sign of gold, I
shall be welcome. I will pluck it everywhere I can and carry only yellow flowers." And soon
her arms were full, but somehow her fingers seemed hot and unpleasant and her arms were heavy,
so she dropped some by the way and carried only those that seemed most desirable.

This is an atom: 
But some were blue--blue as the sky. "Blue for blue blood," she said. "Those of royal birth
are always to be desired. I shall make my sheaf largely of blue." So she added one here and
another there till she was satisfied that the sheaf would be of all the sheaves the most beautiful.
But the odor was sickening, and again one after another was dropped till only a few remained.

This is an atom: 
And some flowers there were in the path that were red. "One needs fewer of these," she said,
"but surely some must be red. I shall put red flowers for courage where they shall be seen,
for courage is of all the virtues to be desired." But there were thorns on the red flowers
and, try as she would, she could not hide the thorns so that they might not pierce her flesh.
So there could be few of the red in the sheaf.

This is an atom: 
Some plants there were that bore no blossoms but the leaves were beautiful, so she added leaves
of this and of that, even though she knew that in some there was deadly poison. "I can hide
it among the rest. It is so beautiful that it must be a part of my sheaf," thought the girl.

This is an atom: 
But along the way, there had been many flowers that had been passed unnoticed. White they were.
Often they were small but always they were pure and sweet. Only once had she plucked one and
then she had added it because of its fragrance. "Oh, yes," she said, "I know white is for purity
but white flowers are old-fashioned. Of course I must have a few but many would spoil my sheaf.
It must be bright with color."

This is an atom: 
So the days flew by and her sheaf was nearly complete. The other Companion Alaniz, who is with
Havi, when Alonso del Castillo, i Andrès Dorantes, with all the others left, then died, I
take him out of there, I went to the island each year, i asked him, we were to us that morning

This is an atom: 
THE HOUSE OF TRUTH

This is an atom: 
It was plain to be seen that Bess Keats was very much disturbed about something. She sat in
the couch hammock on the porch, talking to herself and occasionally giving a sharp punch to
the sofa pillow by her side.

This is an atom: 
"Mother is so old-fashioned," she said to herself, "and she gets worse every year. Last year
she wouldn't let me wear the kind of dresses I wanted to and I looked different from the rest
of the girls all the year. Then she wouldn't let me go camping with the party because only
one mother was going to take care of us. Surely one woman can take care of twenty boys and
girls. Of course I was glad I hadn't gone when they had the accident and partly burned the
cottage, but she wouldn't let me go just because she had old-fashioned notions. Girls these
days don't do as they did when she was young.

This is an atom: 
"I just can't see a reason in the world why I shouldn't invite Henry Mann to take me to the
leap-year party at the beach. Every girl in the crowd is asking a fellow to take her. Of course
if George were here, mother might let me go with him; but he isn't and all the girls want Henry
to go because he spends his money in such a dandy way; so I said I would invite him to take
me, never thinking for a minute that mother would object. And now she says, not only that I
can't ask him, but that I can't go. Well, I will, anyway. So there! I just will go."

This is an atom: 
Then Bess pushed her head far down in the pillow to think out a way. If grandmother were only
alive she would help her. She had always found a way to get what Bess wanted. But grandmother
was dead and Bess must work it out alone, so she began to think.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly she heard a voice saying,

This is an atom: 
"Why, Bessie dear, whatever is the matter? You look very unhappy. Tell me all about it."

This is an atom: 
And there was grandmother with the neat, black silk dress and the dainty white collar, and
even the pretty white apron that she used to wear. Oh! Oh! how glad Bess was to see her!

This is an atom: 
Hand in hand, they went away from the house to where the trees in the orchard were bending
with fruit, and, sitting there on a stone, Bess told her all about her trouble. Whatever would
the girls think of her when she had promised to invite the boy they all wanted? And after she
had told it every bit, she squeezed grandma's hand very hard and said,

This is an atom: 
"And now, Granny dear, you will help me, won't you? It is perfectly all right to ask him for
all the girls do it. I want him to take me."

This is an atom: 
"Well, well, dear," said the grandmother, "if we find that it is all right, I shall be glad
to find a way to help you. But we must see. We must see."

This is an atom: 
"See what, grandmother?" asked the girl. "There is nothing to see."

This is an atom: 
"Indeed there is, child," said Granny. "In times of trouble one must always see the Truth.
Then the way is easy. After I see the Truth, I shall be able to tell what to do. Come and we
shall soon find out. You see you belong to my family and my family is proud of the fact that
its girls have all been ladies. So we must go to the keeper of the book and see what a lady
can do in this case."

This is an atom: 
On and on they went till they came to a queer little old man standing before a big, big book.
Granny went daintily up to him and said,

This is an atom: 
"Will you tell me if it is ever right for a young lady to ask a strange young man to take her
to a dance, and pay out his money for her, when he has not even been to her home or met her
mother? My grandchild says all the girls do it, so I suppose it must be a new thing that has
been written in the book since I was a girl. I want her to be sure to be a lady, so before
I help her to ask the boy to take her, I want you to look for the rule."

This is an atom: 
The little old man began slowly to shake his head but he never said a word. He just looked
and looked and looked. His finger went up one page and down another. Finally he looked straight
at Bess and said to Granny,

This is an atom: 
"Your granddaughter is mistaken. That is not done by ladies. It is not here. It is not here."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, you are old-fashioned just like my mother," began Bess. "It may not be there but it is
true just the same that all ladies do it nowadays."

This is an atom: 
"Hush, child," said Granny. "What is written there is true--but it is only half the truth even
then. Let us go and see the rest. If it is right for you to ask him, then let us see the truth
about the boy. Is he one that our family would like to have specially chosen for your friend?
We must know about him."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Granny, he is all right. He doesn't study much and he doesn't do what mother believes
is right on Sunday. But he has a car, and a motor boat, and he is all right. Let me ask him,"
begged Bess.

This is an atom: 
"Tut, tut, child," said Granny. "Perhaps you do not know. This is the House of Truth and we
can tell."

This is an atom: 
Then they entered a very large house and Granny walked to a man who stood near the door.

This is an atom: 
"May I go to the M room?" she asked, with a smile.

This is an atom: 
"I will show you the way, lady," said the man, and Bess noted how the man had spoken the word
"lady." Somehow every one knew as soon as they looked at Granny that she was a lady. 'Twas
very strange!

This is an atom: 
Down a long hall they went and then they stood before a large wall of mirrors. What a strange
place this was! Before them in the mirror were many, many men and boys, all struggling to get
up a very steep hill. Some had a few strings ahead of them to help them up and many, many strings
behind that were pulling them back to the foot of the hill. Others had only a few in back and
many in front. Some were hopelessly entangled and seemed not able to move. Who were they and
what were they doing?

This is an atom: 
Curiosity led Bess to study the scene in front of her. On the very top of the hill there was
a bright sign, "Christian Manhood." This, then, was the thing for which they were struggling.
But what were the strings? She pushed and reached but she just couldn't read the words.

This is an atom: 
"Did you want to know the truth about a friend?" said a voice. "I will gladly help you for
you are young and need to know. I am old and to know the truth may only make me more unhappy.
Take my place." And she was given a nearer stand.

This is an atom: 
Now she could read the words on the strings that held the men back. One said "Drink" and another
"Bad Companions," and another "Bad Temper." Bess was very much interested, so she began to
study the faces of the men who were pushing to the top.

This is an atom: 
Why! Away up there with the first was George Meyer, her good friend from childhood. He had
many, many strings to help and only a few to hinder. And there was Edward Mead. He was such
a goody-goody at school that she didn't care much for him. Why, he wouldn't whisper at all!

This is an atom: 
Near the middle of the hill was Philip Marks. She knew him well and he had many things to help
and many to hinder but he was surely trying. But Granny had brought her here to see the truth
about Henry Mann. Was he here? She hadn't seen him.

This is an atom: 
First she searched among those near the top. He was such a bright boy when out with the crowd
and he had so many good things in his life that surely he must be near the top. But he wasn't
there. Neither was he near the middle. Surely he must be there somewhere for his name began
with M. Finally she asked the man who had given her his place if he could see a boy named Henry
Mann on the hill.

This is an atom: 
"I should say I could," was the answer. "There he is near the foot of the hill, hopelessly
entangled in his drawbacks. It isn't hard to find that young man here."

This is an atom: 
Sure enough, there he was and Bess's face grew very red as she saw all the strings behind him.
She was glad Granny had gone to sit down so that she wouldn't see him. Perhaps she could read
what some of his drawbacks were, for he was quite near. There was, "Too much money," "Lazy,"
"Unkind to his mother," "Little schooling," "Drinks and smokes and swears," "A friend of careless
girls"....

This is an atom: 
Oh, dear! Bess didn't want to read any more. What a list he had! There were one or two good
strings but they could not do much against so many others to pull him back.

This is an atom: 
Up there very near to the top, George, her old friend, was moving on and his face was so earnest.
How different it looked as she compared him with Henry at the foot! She had never known before
that he was so handsome. What were the strings that were pulling him forward? She leaned far
forward to see. Just then she heard Granny's voice close at her elbow.

This is an atom: 
"Were you trying to look at George, Bess? He is a long way toward manhood, isn't he? Suppose
you use my little glass to help you."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, now I can see," she answered. There is "A good mother," "A keen mind," "A strong body,"
"Love of right and truth," "A good girl friend"....

This is an atom: 
"But, Granny dear," said Bess, "one of his helps is 'A good girl friend.' Has George a girl?
I thought he didn't care for girls."

This is an atom: 
"This is the House of Truth, dear," said the old lady. "I think perhaps that good girl friend
means you, for you have been a good friend to him. You know our family have always been proud
of their education and their habits of life. I am sure it must have been a good thing for George
to grow up all these years with a good chum like you. He must be a gentleman if he would be
fit to play with the daughter of a lady like your mother. When I was here before, George had
several other pull-backs, but I see he has conquered them. But come, dear, it is time we were
going if I am to help you out of your difficulty.

This is an atom: 
"Let me see, you wanted to ask Henry Mann to take you to a party at the beach. Did you find
him there? Do you think your mother will change her mind when we tell her the truth about the
new friend whom you wish to make? If so, I am ready to try, even though I am not at all sure
that a lady does those things. But things change--things change very much and perhaps you are
right. What said the House of Truth? Shall we invite him?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Granny, never, never!" cried the girl. "I could never ask any one who was known as the
friend of careless girls. He has so many drawbacks--oh, no, never."

This is an atom: 
Just then a voice said, "Good evening, Miss Keats. I hope I haven't disturbed your nap. One
of the girls told me you were very anxious to see me, so I came up."

This is an atom: 
And there stood Henry Mann.

This is an atom: 
For a moment the girl could not answer. The face that had looked so handsome when it was pointed
out to her on the street yesterday now looked careless and insolent. She wanted to run away
and not even answer.

This is an atom: 
But just at that moment the door opened and her mother came out. She was dressed so prettily
and her voice was soft and sweet as she said, "I think I haven't met you, but you must be one
of my daughter's friends. Will you be seated?"

This is an atom: 
"A man must be a gentleman if he would be fit to play with the daughter of a lady like your
mother," thought Bess.

This is an atom: 
Then she straightened her shoulders and, smiling, said, "Mother, this is Henry Mann, of whom
I spoke to you."

This is an atom: 
Turning to the boy, who still stood at the top of the steps, she said, "Thank you so much for
calling, Mr. Mann. There has been a mistake. Mother prefers that I should not go to the party
at the beach and of course I want to do as she thinks best. I am sorry to have made you this
trouble. Perhaps one of the other girls will be asked to fill my place so that you can still
be one of the party."

This is an atom: 
Then Henry Mann tipped his hat and went down the street thinking how beautiful the mother and
daughter were. But Bess and her mother stood there with their arms about each other, waiting
for father to come home to tea. And Bess was no longer unhappy.

This is an atom: 
MARKED FOR A MAST

This is an atom: 
Mary had just come from the little post-office in the town where she was spending the summer,
and in her hand she held a bunch of letters. Mail time was the event of the day, and all the
summer people flocked about the office as soon as the little boat carrying the mail was heard
blowing her whistle below the bend.

This is an atom: 
To-day Mary had been very impatient as the old postmaster had slowly sorted the mail. She had
watched him look carefully at one address after another, and, knowing him as she did, she was
sure that many in the town would know by night how many interesting letters had come to people
in the town. She had been almost the first at the little window for her mail and then had had
to brave the laugh of the rest when Mr. Blake had said,

This is an atom: 
"Here's your letter and it's a fat one that took four cents. My, but he must like you."

This is an atom: 
Mary had been waiting for this very letter because in the last one George had said, "I have
a big surprise in store for you but I can't tell you yet--maybe in the next letter."

This is an atom: 
So this long one must be the surprise. Eagerly she tore it open and read the first two pages
that told of things happening in the home town and good times the young people were having.
Then she read,

This is an atom: 
"And now for my secret. You know we are going to our camp for a whole month of fun in August.
Mother likes you and you are such good company for us all that she tells me to write in her
name and ask you to spend the first two weeks with us there. Don't say no for we--no, I--must
surely have you to share our good times."

This is an atom: 
The first two weeks! Those were the weeks she had planned to go to the conference and train
for some special work for the church during the coming winter. The church had said they would
pay her expenses if she cared to go, and already she had made application. Oh, dear! Now what
should she do? She had said to her pastor, "I want to go to the conference more than anything
I have ever wanted but I can't afford to go." Now she wanted to go with her friends and she
would have to say to him, "I want a good time more than I want the conference." The conference
would come again the next year, but this invitation might never come again.

This is an atom: 
To be sure, she had many, many good times. Maybe she would have a good time at the conference.
Which did she want the more? If she went with her friends, she could not do the winter work
at the church as it ought to be done. But there was the last sentence. "We--no, I--must have
you to share our good times." That meant a lot to her as she read it. Should she go to the
conference or should she go to the camp?

This is an atom: 
Mechanically she turned the other letters over. There was one from mother, and one from a school
friend, and a business letter--oh, here was a correspondence card from Mrs. Lane, her teacher
in the Church School.

This is an atom: 
"Dear Mrs. Lane," thought Mary. "How I should love to see her! She was going to Maine. I wonder
if this little snapshot is a picture of some pines where she is staying."

This is an atom: 
After looking long at the beautiful, tall pines in the picture, she turned to the card and read,

This is an atom: 
"Dear Mary:

This is an atom: 
"As we came up the beautiful Sebago Lake last week, I saw something
  that reminded me of you so strongly that I must tell you of it. Away
  off in the distance, we saw some wonderful pines that towered high
  above the rest. They seemed so tall that we spoke to the pilot of the
  boat about them and he told us this story about them.

This is an atom: 
"'Years and years ago, before this land was settled by any but the
  Indians, King George of England sent men to this country to look for
  tall trees that would make good masts for his ships. They went up the
  rivers and lakes looking everywhere for the special trees. Here on
  these hills they found these great trees. So the men marked "K.G." on
  the trees, charted them on a map which they carried, and went on
  their way. But for some reason they were never cut and carried away
  to be used on his ships. There they stand to-day, strong and
  straight, marked for masts.'

This is an atom: 
"After the old man had finished his story and had left us, I said to
  my friend, 'Marked for a mast because it is straight and strong. I
  have a girl who also is marked for a mast and some day she will carry
  with her, under her colors, many boys and girls. We are sending her
  to the leaders' conference this summer so that she may begin to make
  ready for her work.' Mary, dear, it is wonderful to have been chosen
  by the King of England and to have been marked for use with his
  initials, but it is more wonderful to have been chosen by a greater
  king and marked with his name. Perhaps you can guess what the mark I
  see on you might be--It is C. L. Write and tell me all about the
  conference, won't you?

This is an atom: 
"Lovingly your friend,

This is an atom: 
"Margaret Lane."

This is an atom: 
'Twas a very thoughtful girl who went down the street. In one hand a long letter and in the
other a closely written card. The one said, "Come and have a real jolly, good time." The other
said, "Get ready for service." Which should it be?

This is an atom: 
As she sat in the hammock thinking of her good friend in Maine, there came again to her mind
the last night Mrs. Lane had been with them. They had been talking over plans for the summer
and Mrs. Lane had quietly said, "I like to think that a good time is one which you carry with
you and which means more to you as the weeks go by than it did when you were enjoying it."
Which good time would she carry with her longer? Which would make of her the finer girl? Which
did she want most to carry with her? And as she thought, the way became clearer.

This is an atom: 
Finally she went to her room and returned in a few minutes with a writing case and pen.

This is an atom: 
"Dear George," she began. "Weren't you good to ask me to go with the
  family to the camp! I can't think of any camp where I would enjoy
  myself more and I surely appreciate the invitation. But I can't
  accept it this time for that is the time set for the conference to
  which I am really going this year. Our church has made it possible
  for me to go, and I know it will do much in getting me ready to be of
  help to those who have helped me so much. I shall have so much more
  to give when I have studied for the two weeks with those who know,
  and have given their lives to the service of others. 'Tis an
  opportunity that I couldn't miss--not even for two weeks with you
  all. Thank you just the same."

This is an atom: 
Mary read the letter, then as she sealed it, she said with a smile, "Marked for a mast! Marked
for a mast! Surely I mustn't bend or break if I can be a mast some day and carry a king's colors.
C. L.?... C. L.?... Ah, I have it. 'Tis the word that Mrs. Lane uses so often--a Christian
Leader! 'Tis wonderful to have her think I have been chosen to bear such a splendid name. I
can hardly wait to meet the rest of the girls, who also wear the mark of the King, who will
be there at the conference. I may be--oh, I hope I am--marked for a mast."

This is an atom: 
HER NEED

This is an atom: 
She was just a girl with a foreign name, a foreign face and a bit still of a foreign dress.
But she was a girl, just the same, and her face was full of longing. Her home was near to a
settlement where many girls came for lessons and for play. But somehow they had never asked
her to come, though often she had sat on the steps at night where they must pass her. She had
seen them come with their arms about each other, talking and laughing and singing--and when
they had passed, she had gone to her lonely hall bedroom and hidden her face in the pillow.

This is an atom: 
Oh, no, she didn't cry. She was too brave to cry. She just suffered alone and longed for help.

This is an atom: 
It had been a year since she had left the home across the sea and had come to join her father
in the land where "work was plenty and friends were easily made." But she had found her father
living where she could not and would not live. The friends he had made in America she could
not and would not have for hers. So when she had grown proficient enough in the factory, she
had gone to live in that loneliest of all lonely places--a boarding house.

This is an atom: 
The days had passed one by one. Some of the boarders called her fussy; some said she was cold;
some said she was "stuck-up" and none of them had found that beneath the surface there was
a sweet, gentle, lonely heart.

This is an atom: 
Then came the strike--and she was out of work. In the bank she had a few dollars but they had
soon fled and now--oh, what could she do? The way was so black ahead. She couldn't go to her
father and his friends. What could she do?

This is an atom: 
The girls passed her as they went to the settlement house but no one noticed her sad little
face. So she slowly rose and wended her way down the street. Out of the poorer section she
went, then down a long avenue till she came to a great church. The altar lights were lighted.
All was quiet and restful, so she sat, and looked, and listened for the still, small voice
that she longed to hear.

This is an atom: 
A long, long time she sat there, counting her beads. Then she slowly rose and entered the confessional,
but when she came out there was still the look of longing in her face. Toward the altar she
went. Perhaps in the communion she might find help for her troubled soul, and again she counted
her beads.

This is an atom: 
But, somehow, there was no prayer on the beads that seemed just what she wanted to say. Again,
she went to the altar. But this time she lifted a face, white with suffering and thin from
lack of food, to the face of the Christ above the altar and from the depths of her heart she
prayed,

This is an atom: 
"O God! My God! I do not ask for money, though I am hungry. I do not ask for a home, though
I am oh! so very lonely. I do not ask for work, though I have none. For only one thing I ask.
Give me a friend. Oh, give me a friend! For Jesus' sake. Amen."

This is an atom: 
Again she walked back through the avenue and down the narrow street to her only home. The doors
of the settlement were opened and the girls came out, happy as birds in the springtime. Quietly
she watched them as they came nearer. Then suddenly one of them stopped.

This is an atom: 
"Excuse me for speaking to you," she said, "but our guardian heard that you lived in this house,
so she asked us to come and invite you to come to Camp Fire with us next Tuesday. We are to
have a supper together so that you will soon know us all and then we are to go for a hike together.
Shall we stop for you as we go?"

This is an atom: 
For a moment she could not answer. In her throat was a lump so big that she could not swallow.
Then she said in a low, sweet voice,

This is an atom: 
"Indeed I should like to go. Thank you for asking me."

This is an atom: 
And the girls passed down the street, singing their Camp Fire song.

This is an atom: 
But up in the little hall bedroom there was a girl with a foreign name, and a foreign face,
and a bit of a foreign dress. She was on her knees, looking up at the heavens full of stars
and over and over she was saying, "Oh, I thank thee. I thank thee. I have a chance to be a friend."

This is an atom: 
And her heart was content.

This is an atom: 
THE MESSAGE OF THE MOUNTAIN

This is an atom: 
"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."... "Lo, I am with you alway, even
unto the end of the world." These were the two sentences that were neatly written on two pieces
of paper on Marcia Loran's desk and the girl sat looking at them while the minutes went steadily
by. How could they be? How could a power that made the earth be also in her life? How could it be?

This is an atom: 
Marcia had always been a reader of her Bible; she had always loved her mother's God and she
loved Him now, but she was longing for help and no one seemed near to give it. And the reason
for the need of this help was easy to give. The new girl who had moved into the next room had
been laughing at her belief in God and Marcia knew no way to answer. She had hoped that her
course in Bible at college would help her but somehow she seemed less able than ever to answer
it now.

This is an atom: 
Who was God? Where was God? How could she know that these two verses could both be true? It
was an honest doubt and she knew she must answer it before her mind could be at rest. She felt
she could never ask the question in a letter to her mother, for mother must never know that
she was questioning. Oh, if only some one knew how much she needed help!

This is an atom: 
But it was time for the picnic which the members of her class were to have, so she slipped
the papers again into her Bible and went to the campus. They were to climb one of the mountains
near by and dear old Professor Hastings was to be their guide. Old in years but young in heart
and lithe still in limb, he stood out among the students as one of the best of the companions.
As they climbed, Marcia kept near to him.

This is an atom: 
"I am looking," he said, "for a rare little flower which grows on this mountainside. Perhaps
you can help me find it. It is very tiny and it grows in the crevice of the rock. But I am
needing a specimen of it for my collection."

This is an atom: 
So together they looked in every crevice but not a bit of the little white blossom did they see.

This is an atom: 
Up, and up, and up they went. Some were tired and waited for the rest to climb and return.
Some even went back down the mountainside. But when the top was reached, what a wonderful view
spread out before them! Mountains and lakes and streams; villages and cities and lonely farms;
beauty and calmness and majesty, all seemed to flood in at once on the minds and hearts of
those who looked.

This is an atom: 
After they had rested a while, the old man lightly touched the hand of the girl and said,

This is an atom: 
"I have heard it said that one of my blossoms has been found on that cliff not far away. Will
you come with me to see?"

This is an atom: 
So they began to search the cliff; then they found a hidden cave and explored that; Marcia
heard a tiny stream of water trickling in the cave, and when she had found the water, she found
also, close to the water's edge, a beautiful clump of waxy white blossoms, sweet and fragrant,
and hanging tightly to the rock.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! oh! Come, sir," called the girl. "I am sure these are what you seek. Oh, how beautiful
they are!" And they stooped to gather them.

This is an atom: 
But just at that moment a flash of lightning lighted the cave and the thunder rolled. In a
moment the rain was coming in torrents, and the noise of the thunder as it rolled from cliff
to cliff was terrifying. A giant pine tree which stood just before the entrance of the cave
was rent from top to bottom and went crashing down the mountainside. The noise of the wind
and storm was deafening. Pale and trembling, the girl pushed farther and farther into the cave
till, crouching down, she touched something cool. It was the little white flowers.

This is an atom: 
They were not afraid. The rain might fall as hard as it would but it would not blast their
beauty. They were protected by a bit of overhanging rock. The lightning might flash about the
cave but it was calm inside. Who had made the tiny blossoms to grow here in the rock, protected
from storm and blast? God! She, too, was being cared for while her companions might be in the
fury of the storm. Who was caring for her? Her friend? No, he was interested in something at
the entrance of the cave. God was caring for her even as he cared for the little blossom.

This is an atom: 
"Come, Marcia, come and watch the storm," called the professor. "I have never seen such a beautiful
one. Isn't it strange that that electricity was all there in the clouds as we came up the mountain
though we knew it not? I love to watch a storm for it shows so clearly the power and majesty
of our God. Watch the trees bend with the wind! Listen to the rocks send back the sound of
the thunder! See the little bird on yonder nest snuggling close to keep the little ones safe!
And see, far away, the sun shining on the little village of the plain. We are in the storm,
child, yet we are safe and sheltered."

This is an atom: 
With her hand held fast in that of her old friend, the fear gradually died away, and when the
storm was over she, too, was glad she had seen from the mountaintop the wonder of a mountain storm.

This is an atom: 
Soon they gathered the little white blossoms, but not all of them found their way into the
collection at the college. A little spray was tenderly pressed between the leaves of Marcia
Loran's Bible and a third little slip of paper was fastened to the other two. It read: "God
is great but God is love. I will trust him and not be afraid."

This is an atom: 
THE WINNING OF AN HONOR

This is an atom: 
Barbara Lewis was very much puzzled. All the girls in her camp fire were winning the right
to embroider their symbol on the dress of their guardian and she wanted to do the same. But
how could she? She had chosen for her name, "Chante--I _serve_," and she wanted to really win
the right to have the name, but how could she? She was not allowed to go into the kitchen to
help there at home, for the cook would leave if she were disturbed, so she couldn't do as some
of her friends were doing and learn to cook. She couldn't serve mother, for mother was always
away at the club or doing work about the country for the suffrage cause. There were maids to
do the mending and the sewing, so how could she serve there?

This is an atom: 
Some of the girls could serve at their church, but her teacher had never asked her to do one
thing, though she was always ready. Her teacher had not formed a club of her girls, so of course
she knew them only on Sundays. There was no chance to serve the church. If she only knew the
minister, perhaps he would suggest a way, but he was very tall and very dignified, so she just
couldn't ask him. Whatever could she do?

This is an atom: 
It had been weeks since their guardian had told them that when they had earned the right to
their names, they could embroider the symbol on her dress, and every day since then she had
wished she knew what to do. Mary had chosen the name "Aka--I _can_," and when she had proved
that she could break herself of using slang by using none for a whole month, she put a tiny
little white flower on the dress, for she was using pure speech.

This is an atom: 
"Frilohe" was the name Grace had chosen and it meant, "_A friend who loves to help_." Grace's
mother had been in the hospital and Grace had taken care of the brothers and sisters all the
time, so, of course, they all agreed that she had earned the right.

This is an atom: 
And now Barbara felt that she just must think of a way. She would go to the library and ask
her friend there if she knew what she could do to serve.

This is an atom: 
Now it chanced that from that library there were going out almost every day girls to tell stories
to groups of children about the city. Sometimes they went to the orphan homes, sometimes to
the hospitals, sometimes to the crowded streets. Into many needy places they were sent, and
already the children were beginning to look for the gypsy-girls who were story-tellers. As
Barbara entered the library, one of the girls was just leaving, so she stopped for a moment
and told about her new work and how much she loved it.

This is an atom: 
"Aha," said Barbara, "I believe I could do that. I have read such lots and lots of stories,
I am sure I could do that. I should love to try. But they haven't asked me. I couldn't volunteer,
for mother would think me very bold. Oh dear, I am sure I could serve in that way."

This is an atom: 
All the way home she thought the matter over and then a plan came to her. Just back of the
house there was an alley and the little children there were always looking through the fence
at the flowers in her beautiful garden. She would tell stories to these little children and
see what she could do. So she went into the house to find the stories she would use. All the
afternoon she looked in her old books. Then she was sure she was ready.

This is an atom: 
For a long time she hesitated the next morning as she dressed. She must look her very best
if she was to win the children. Finally she chose a little blue gingham dress that she liked
much--perhaps they would like it too. It was only ten o'clock when she went into the garden
to wait. Dear me! Weren't they coming this morning? One hour passed and then another half.

This is an atom: 
Just then Tommy, the boy who threw stones, and chased the cats, and did all sorts of things
that were naughty, pushed his dirty face against the fence. Oh my, she could never tell stories
to him! But Tommy saw her there in the garden and said:

This is an atom: 
"Wisht you would give me a posy. Mom's sick and she hain't got none."

This is an atom: 
Then the gate of the garden was opened and Barbara said:

This is an atom: 
"Of course I will give you some flowers for your mother. Choose what you would like and I will
cut it with these shears."

This is an atom: 
"Um! Um!" said Tommy. "Um! I'd like some of them blue flowers. Say, I like blue flowers, and
blue sky, and I like that blue dress. I wish Mary had a blue dress."

This is an atom: 
"And who is Mary?" said Barbara.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, she is one of my sisters," said Tommy. "You see, there is six of us and Mary is the pretty
one. She has blue eyes and curls. Um! Um! I wish you could see her."

This is an atom: 
"I'd like to see her," said Barbara. "If you will go and bring her here I will tell you both
a story. Would you like that?"

This is an atom: 
"Sure," said Tommy. "Sure I would. Kin I bring them all?" and off he ran with his precious flowers.

This is an atom: 
In five minutes he was back, followed by Mary and Katie and Jimmie and Mike and Susan--all
dirty, all barefoot, and all in a hurry to see the flowers and hear the story. About this time
Barbara began to feel queer inside. How could she ever keep them still? Suppose they should
begin to run over her father's flowers! She almost wished she had not asked them to come. But
she remembered for what she was working, and she said to herself, "Chante, _I serve_; Chante--_I
serve_," over and over till her courage came back.

This is an atom: 
Then she seated them all on the steps and began. Susie wanted "Red Riding Hood," and Katie
wanted "Goldilocks," so these were first. Then Mary wanted "Cinderella," but Tommy was not
to be forgotten.

This is an atom: 
"I want a boy's story. Tell me the one you promised me or I'll push the rest all home," he said.

This is an atom: 
What could she do? She never remembered having read a boy's story. Oh dear, maybe she couldn't
win Tommy.

This is an atom: 
Over and over in her mind went the stories she had gotten ready. Then she remembered one that
she had loved years ago. It was about Cedric, the Knight. This was just the one for Tommy.
So she told it to him while his eyes grew bigger and bigger. When the story was done, Barbara
and Tommy were friends and Tommy had a new hero.

This is an atom: 
When the dinner bell rang, she was still telling stories to the dirty little group but she
had forgotten why she was doing it, for she was living the stories with the children.

This is an atom: 
The days went by and every morning found Barbara out in the garden, if only for one story,
but now the Lowinskys were not the only ones. They had brought their neighbors and friends
till the group sometimes numbered forty. The steps had grown too small, so they had moved to
the wall. Then that had not been satisfactory, so they had moved out under the trees away down
by the little brook. Here the birds sang, the little brook whispered, and everything was just
right for the little story-teller. Over and over she had told the stories with a new one now
and then, but Cedric, the Knight, was the favorite one. Tommy always stood near Barbara and
saw to it that all the boys were listening, so he had a fine chance to whisper, "Now my story.
Please tell mine."

This is an atom: 
And she was telling it again one morning when she realized that some one stood near who was
not a child. It was Miss Rose, her guardian, who listened for a moment and then drew back where
the children could not see her. When the story hour was over, she was nowhere to be seen. But
later in the evening a package was left at the door for Barbara. It contained that precious
dress for which she had longed.

This is an atom: 
Pinned to the dress was a card which said, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these,
my little ones, ye have done it unto me." And below was written, "I shall be glad to have you
put your symbol on my dress before Friday night so that we may tell the girls at the Ceremonial
about your story-group."

This is an atom: 
Later when Barbara had finished the embroidery, it showed a tiny figure of a primitive woman
surrounded by little children. And the little lady was telling them a story. She had found
her way to serve.

This is an atom: 
DADDY GRAY'S TEST

This is an atom: 
May Langley had spent four happy years at the University, and now Commencement time had come.
It had been easy for her to get her lessons, so she had had time to herself. She was pretty
and was always well dressed; she could dance well and sing well, so of course she had been
a favorite, especially with the boys.

This is an atom: 
But the coming of the end of the school life had brought to her a real problem. She knew some
of the boys would want to write to her. Deep in her heart she knew that some of them already
liked her more than a little. She could not write to all of them. Whom should she choose? Perhaps
the one she chose would eventually be the one she should marry, so it was wise to choose with
care. Over and over she turned the question in her mind.

This is an atom: 
There was Tom,--gay, careless Tom with a big heart and plenty of money. His father was an oil
man and there was no other child. He had done little with his studies but he had given her
many a good time. His life would probably be one of ease. Tom was really quite attractive.

This is an atom: 
Then there was Bob, the football player. Already his name was known throughout the country.
It was great fun to go to games where he was to play, for she shared the honors with him afterward.
He was rough and ready, and, at times, a bit too boisterous, but withal a good fellow.

This is an atom: 
Then there was Earl, the student. He had ranked first in his class but his books were all in
all to him. A good position was waiting for him in a neighboring college and he had told her
that he should marry so that he could have a home of his own to which the students might come.

This is an atom: 
There were others, too, but these three seemed to stand out first in her thoughts. How could
she decide? She and her mother were alone in the world and mother was a helpless cripple and
so could not come to the Commencement. For the first time in her life, she began to face the
future seriously.

This is an atom: 
'Twas the Sunday of Commencement week and she was strolling across the campus when she saw
in the distance dear, old Professor Gray--Daddy Gray, the girls called him.

This is an atom: 
"He is the very person to help me," she said to herself, and hurried to catch him before he
left the campus.

This is an atom: 
"Daddy Gray," she began, "I have a queer question to ask you. I am choosing some boy friends
whom I wish to have as friends after I leave. Tell me some principles on which to base my choice."

This is an atom: 
A rare smile crossed the face of the old man as he patted her golden hair.

This is an atom: 
"Good for you! I am glad you are thinking. Long, long ago when my own girlies were choosing
their friends I asked them to remember two things as they chose--not only that the one they
chose might be their husband, but that he also might be my son, and the father of their children.
One thinks much more about the principles of the man who is to be father of their children
than about the man whom they love and want to marry. You know what a high ideal your mother
holds. Test your friends by that also. Never mind yourself--think of others."

This is an atom: 
Then he left her to think.

This is an atom: 
And she did think! If Tom ignored her mother as he did his own, she could never bring him into
their home. Tom drank sometimes--oh, that would never do. Bob was strong and healthy--but Bob
had no use for God and the church. Her children must have a Christian home. Earl was a wonderful
student, but he had undermined his health. He stooped in his shoulders and there were signs
of a breakdown. Oh dear, what a hard test Daddy Gray had given her!

This is an atom: 
So the days wore away and she found herself watching as she had never watched before for marks
of strength--mental, moral and physical. Over and over the words rang in her ears: "Never mind
yourself--think of others."

This is an atom: 
'Twas the afternoon of Commencement Day and her room had many beautiful flowers. Tom's bunch
was of great American Beauty roses and the card had made her suddenly blush as she read it.
But there had come in the mail a great bunch of beautiful forget-me-nots, all fresh with the
dew in the grass. Who had sent them? She loved them the best of all the flowers in the room.
There was no card to be found, so she tucked a few in her dress beneath the cap and gown and
ran away to the chapel.

This is an atom: 
There on the steps stood a young man and his mother, and they were waiting for her.

This is an atom: 
"May, I want you to meet my mother, for I have told her so much about you. To get her to come,
I had to drive all the way home to-day. But it is worth it, even if I did have to get up before
the sun did. She is the very best mother in all the world," said the boy, and he squeezed the
arm of the timid little lady.

This is an atom: 
"Maybe! Maybe! I am so glad to meet you," said the mother, "for I owe you much. You have helped
Gene such a lot. I am sure he would never have been able to keep from smoking had it not been
for you. He had promised me to try. Then when you told him you did not like it, why, we worked
together, you see. And it has been so kind of you to go for the hikes when he has asked you,
for you see he couldn't have afforded to go to places that cost money, dear."

This is an atom: 
May Langley opened her eyes wide. She had had no idea that she had been helping. To be sure,
she had gone on many hikes with him after the geology class had thrown them together. And she
had enjoyed it, too, for he was such good company. Always courteous, always hunting for ways
to make the trip more worth while and always good natured, no matter what the weather, he had
been a companion worth while.

This is an atom: 
So she stood and talked with the mother and son for a moment. How sweet the mother was and
how proud he was of her! It was a joy to watch them.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly he spied the bit of forget-me-not.

This is an atom: 
"Ah," he said, "I had nearly forgotten to speak of them. I passed a brook lined with them just
before time for the mail train to pass the station, so I just hopped out of the car, emptied
my lunch from the box and sent them to you. But I never dreamed you would get them in time
to wear them. Maybe the little flowers will tell you that I am hoping you are going to remember
our happy days here after we leave the campus. I want much to feel that you have a little interest
in me. I have told mother much about you, for mother and I have no secrets. May I write to
you sometimes?"

This is an atom: 
Just then the bell rang for the line to form and she hurried away, while he took his mother
into the chapel. All afternoon they were busy and there was little time to think. But when
May came to dress for the ball in the evening, she stood long before the flowers on the table.
Then a sprig of the forget-me-not went into her hair and a bunch was fastened to her belt.
And when he asked her for her answer as they stood on the veranda of the fraternity house,
she said simply, "I have enjoyed the time spent with you; I am quite sure that I should like
to know you better. You may write to me if you care to do so."

This is an atom: 
But under her breath she was saying:

This is an atom: 
"Daddy Gray is right. The greatest test of a man is not what he might be to you, but what he
is and will be to others. I'm quite sure Gene Powell can stand his test and mine also."

This is an atom: 
WANTED--A REAL MOTHER

This is an atom: 
Mary King sat before the dressing-table in her bedroom holding in her hand a string of beads--pearls
they were, but they showed signs of much wear, and as Mary looked at them her eyes blazed with
anger.

This is an atom: 
To-morrow was her graduation day from the High School. All day she had been at the class picnic
and she had had such a glorious time. They had danced and played; they had rowed on the lake
and sung their school songs in the moonlight. She had been as happy as a girl could be, and
to have it spoiled in this way was cruel.

This is an atom: 
Why should her mother give her a string of old beads for a graduation present? Other girls
had wrist watches and pretty dresses and checks and all sorts of beautiful things. When they
asked her what her mother's gift had been, how could she say, "A string of old beads"? Mother
would expect her to wear them at her graduation and how could she?

This is an atom: 
She had found them on her table when she had come into her room and with them was a note saying:

This is an atom: 
"Dear Mary:

This is an atom: 
"I waited for you to come home so that I could give you my gift, but
  it is so late and I am too tired to wait longer, so I will leave them
  for you. I could not buy you a real gift, so I have given you the
  dearest thing I have. Every bead has a story which some day I will
  tell you--perhaps on the day that you graduate from college, but not
  now. I hope you will love them as I do. I shall see them to-morrow
  on your pretty new dress. Good night, girlie. I hope you had a good
  time.

This is an atom: 
"MOTHER."

This is an atom: 
Why was mother so queer? All her life long it had been hard for Mary to have her mother so
different. Her mother worked for Mr. Morse and so she could never bring her friends to their
rooms lest she should annoy the Morses. Other girls' mothers had pretty faces and her mother's
face was all red and cross-looking. Other girls' mothers had pretty hair, but her mother had
straight hair and little of it. She had tried to get her to wear false hair, but instead of
doing it her mother had gone to her room and cried because Mary had suggested it. Other girls'
mothers let them wear pretty clothes, but hers were always plain, though they were always very
neat. Most of the girls had fancy graduation dresses, but hers was only a little dimity that
her mother had made--and now these dreadful beads were more than she could stand and she threw
them on the bed in anger. She wished she had a real mother of whom she could be proud.

This is an atom: 
As she started to take down her long, wavy hair, she saw a letter in Mr. Morse's handwriting
on her desk. Perhaps this was a check for her graduation present, so she hastily tore it open.
But no check dropped out. Instead, there was a long letter, and she sat down to read.

This is an atom: 
"My dear Mary," it began. "A few days ago, I chanced to be on the
  beach when you were there with your friend, and I heard you say to
  her, 'I wish my mother were as beautiful as yours. Mother can't even
  go down the street with me for she drags her foot so that everybody
  turns and looks at us and it makes me feel so conspicuous. You must
  be very proud of your mother.' So I have decided that for your
  graduation gift, I shall give you a story instead of the check that
  I intended to give you. The check can wait."

This is an atom: 
"A story," said Mary to herself. "That is worse than the old beads. What a house of queer people
this is! Anyway, I am curious to see what sort of a story he could write." So she read on.

This is an atom: 
"Seventeen years ago there came to a town in the eastern part of
  Pennsylvania a young man and his bride. Just a slip of a girl she
  was, but her face was full of sunshine and every one soon loved her.
  She had beautiful wavy hair and bright, blue eyes and a cheery smile.
  After they had been there for a while, their story came to be known,
  for his father was the great mill owner in a near-by town. When the
  young man had married the High School girl instead of the wealthy one
  whom the father had chosen for him, there had been a lot of trouble
  and the young man had been told to leave home with his bride and
  expect no more help from the father.

This is an atom: 
"Now the young man had never worked, so it was very hard for him, but
  she also worked and, little by little, they bought the things needed
  in the tiny home on the hill, and they were very happy. Then, one
  day, a scaffold fell and they brought the young husband to the little
  wife all bruised and bleeding, and that very night a tiny girl came
  to the home to live. The neighbors helped all they could, but in a
  few days the father of the baby was gone, and the little girl-wife
  was left alone to care for the baby.

This is an atom: 
"When the mill owner heard of the death of the son and the birth of
  the little girl, he sent to the mother and said: 'We will take the
  little girl and bring it up as our own if you will give it to us and
  have no more to do with it.' But the brave little woman sent back
  answer, 'As long as I have a mind with which to think and two hands
  with which to work, I can and will support my little girl. I thank
  you for your offer, but I love my baby too much to accept it.'

This is an atom: 
"But it was a hard pull. She worked in an office; she worked on a
  farm. Then a position was offered her as a teacher in a Home for
  Little Children. Here she could have her own room and keep the baby
  with her when she was not teaching. And while she was teaching, it
  would be cared for with the rest. Gladly the mother took the position
  and for more than a year she was very, very happy.

This is an atom: 
"One night when the baby was nearly three years old, she sat reading
  in the parlor of the home when some one called, 'Fire! Fire! Fire in
  the left wing!' Oh! that was where her baby was, on the very top
  floor. Like a bird she flew across the hall where the smoke already
  was pouring out. Up the first flight, choking, she went. Up the
  second. Then she had to fall to the floor to creep along. She could
  see the fire. It was on the fourth floor where her Mary was. Could
  she ever reach it? Would the fire block her way?

This is an atom: 
"Ten minutes after the call of fire had been given, the workers saw
  some one staggering through the lower hall. In her arms she carried a
  bundle wrapped tightly in a bed-quilt. And dangling from her hands
  was a long string of beads. Her face was burned. There was no hair on
  her head. She was writhing in agony, but she reached the door, handed
  the burden to a worker, saying quietly, 'I am badly burned, but I
  have saved my two treasures. Keep them safely for me.' Then she fell
  in a heap on the floor.

This is an atom: 
"For months and months and months she tossed on a bed of pain. No one
  thought she could possibly live. But she did, for she was living for
  her baby. When at last she came from the hospital, her beautiful
  face was scarred and red; only in spots had the hair grown; her hands
  were stiff and painful, and one leg dragged as she walked. But she
  was alive, and that was all she asked.

This is an atom: 
"While she had been ill, I had gone to see the mill owner to ask for
  help for the brave little woman who had shown us all what a heroine
  she was. But his answer had been, 'She took my son from me and I will
  have nothing to do with her. If she will give the child to me, I will
  bring it up in luxury, but I will not have her here.'

This is an atom: 
"So when she was ready to go back to work, I told her that another
  offer had come from the grandfather of the child to adopt it and I
  said to her, 'Don't you feel that you had better give them the
  baby?'

This is an atom: 
"For answer, she patted the curly head and said, 'If I can fight
  death for my baby, I can conquer in the fight to live. I shall keep
  her. You may tell him that the child will not live in luxury but that
  she shall know no want, and she shall have both the education and
  culture which befits her father's child.'

This is an atom: 
"But the mother's heart was sore when she looked in the glass and saw
  what a pitiful change had come to the pretty face. 'I am so glad it
  came while Mary was little,' she said. 'Had it come later, she would
  have minded my ugly face. Now she knows no better and she will grow
  used to it.'

This is an atom: 
"So she was glad when I offered to have her come to live with us in
  the distant city where none had known of her or of the awful fight
  she was planning to make. We had taken a large house and there were
  many things the mother could do with her stiff hands which gradually,
  because of the long hours she spent on them, were beginning to limber
  a bit. I gave her rooms for herself and the child and there she
  lived, keeping away from all so that none might see her shrunken,
  changed body. She lived only for the child, hoarding carefully the
  little money that she could save lest there be not enough to send her
  to college when the High School should be over.

This is an atom: 
"Often have I heard her praying for strength to fight through the
  battle; often have I heard her pray that the little girl should grow
  to be an honor to the family who would not help her; often have I
  begged her to let me tell the child the story of the days that had
  gone, but her answer was always the same, 'No. Let her live the
  happy, care-free life. Some day I will tell her, but not now. It
  would kill me to have her pity me. She must love me for myself and
  not for what I did. My only happiness is to live and work for her.'

This is an atom: 
"So the heroine has spent the fifteen years and to my way of thinking
  she is a mother of whom you may be proud.

This is an atom: 
"She must never know I have told you. But not for the world would I
  have you add to her burden by thinking she was not all that you
  wanted your mother to be.

This is an atom: 
"Sincerely,

This is an atom: 
"A. E. Morse."

This is an atom: 
When Mary had finished the letter, she sat as one stunned. Her mind seemed on fire. Mechanically
she picked up the pearls that she had thrown on the bed. Her mother had carried them with her
through that awful fire. They were one of her two treasures and now she had almost said she
would not wear them. Oh, what a selfish girl she had been! She had thought only of herself.

This is an atom: 
Once she had asked her mother why the scar was upon her face and she had answered, "Just an
accident, child, when I was a young woman." Then she had talked of something else. The lame
foot, the misshapen hands, the red face, the queer little knot of hair--all were the price
paid for her own life. Every minute since she was born, she had been a burden to her mother.

This is an atom: 
Now she understood why the little bank account which she had accidentally found was being so
carefully saved. She had not known that she was to go to college.

This is an atom: 
Now she remembered that it had been years since mother had had a new dress, but she had thought
it was because she was queer. There had been many days when mother had seemed cross--was it
because she was suffering? Oh, how sorry she was! What could she do to make her happy now that
she knew?

This is an atom: 
Slowly she undressed for bed. She must be in the dark to think. When she knelt in prayer, she
asked God to forgive her--but she remembered that she could not ask mother to do so. She remembered
the words of her mother to Mr. Morse,

This is an atom: 
"It would kill me to have her sorry for me. She must love me for myself and not for what I did."

This is an atom: 
So she tossed and tumbled as the time slipped by. Suddenly she heard a foot dragging across
the hall, and a big lump came into her throat. How often she had rebelled at that foot! Then
her mother came quietly into the room.

This is an atom: 
"Mother," said Mary, "why are you here? Aren't you asleep yet?"

This is an atom: 
"No, dear," said the mother, and the girl thought she had never heard a more beautiful voice.
"I heard you tossing in the bed and I thought perhaps you were ill. So I came to see. What
is the trouble, dear?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, to-morrow is my graduation day and I think I am sorry to leave school," said the girl.
"I love these dear little beads which I have under the pillow, mother. Have you had them long?
I never saw them before."

This is an atom: 
"Many, many years, girlie. Your father gave them to me and how hard he worked to earn them!
I love every little bead on the string. But I shall love to see you wear them for his sake.
I saved them for you once in the long ago because I wanted you to have something that he had
earned for us. And now you must go to sleep, for you must look bright and pretty to-morrow.
Oh! I shall be so proud of you when you start for the school."

This is an atom: 
Then a white arm drew the mother down close to the bed and a sweet girlish voice said,

This is an atom: 
"Be all ready when the carriage comes for me to-morrow, mother dear, for you are going with
me, even though it is early. No other girl has a mother who has worked so hard as you have
to keep her in school. You are the best mother in the whole world and I am so proud of you."

This is an atom: 
"Well, if you are as proud of me as I am of you, we are the happiest little family in the whole
world," said the mother, kissing her on both cheeks. And two people were happy because real
love was there.

This is an atom: 
THE FIR TREE AND THE WILLOW WAND[B]

This is an atom: 
All this happened years ago when the red men lived along the lake shores and hunted in the
woods. The Indians still tell the tale and shake their heads sadly, whether because of the
sadness of the story or because they sigh for the old days, I do not know.

This is an atom: 
Willow Wand was the daughter of old Chief Seafog. She was not like the other girls of the tribe.
She was straight and lithe like a willow, and she looked more like a beautiful boy than she
did like an Indian maiden. This is not strange when you think that she wore the leather leggins
and the short jacket of the Indian boy and carried a bow and quiver of arrows thrown over her
shoulder. And in spite of the fact that she shot a straighter arrow than most of the lads about
her, they all loved her, for she would run with them and hunt with them, and at night, by the
fire, she would tell them strange and beautiful stories. In her face they saw a light that
they did not see in the faces of the other girls and squaws of the village, for Willow Wand
had a secret which made her full of mysteries.

This is an atom: 
As Willow Wand grew taller, the time came when she thought of wedding. Young Fir Tree, the
most daring of the young braves, loved her, and Willow Wand knew that she loved him. And when
Fir Tree went to old Chief Seafog, Willow Wand went with him, which made it not difficult for
them to receive the old man's blessing.

This is an atom: 
So on one brilliant day in Indian summer, Fir Tree and Willow Wand were married. The fallen
leaves danced at their wedding feast and the blue mists of autumn were the bridal veil. Every
one was as happy as an Indian could be. And in the starlight, Fir Tree took Willow Wand to
his tepee. He brought a great buffalo robe from the tent and spread it on the hillside, and
they sat down close together and looked up at the stars.

This is an atom: 
"I love you, my brave Fir Tree," said Willow Wand.

This is an atom: 
Fir Tree put his arm about her. "And I love you, my little Willow Wand," he said. "You are
the most beautiful woman in the world. I would not have you like the rest. They are good; they
grind the corn; they do the work, but their faces are like stones. Yours is full of secrets
and lovely memories. What makes you so different, my love?"

This is an atom: 
"My secret, Fir Tree. My father says that a woman's secret is her beauty."

This is an atom: 
"But a woman must tell her secret to her love," and Fir Tree looked off into the distance.

This is an atom: 
"Willow Wand must not tell her secret even to her love," she said very, very softly.

This is an atom: 
"You cannot trust me nor love me then, Willow Wand," said Fir Tree, growing stiff and cold.

This is an atom: 
"I love you, Fir Tree. I will tell you my secret."

This is an atom: 
Fir Tree continued to look off in the darkness, but he bent his head a little so that he might
not miss anything she said.

This is an atom: 
"One night, long ago, I sat out in the evening like this with my father. 'Father, I want to
shoot your bow, your smallest bow,' I said. 'You haven't the strength to draw it, even my smallest
bow, little Willow Wand,' he said. 'Oh, but I have. I have tried it,' and I ran into the tent
and brought the little bow with the red bear painted on it. 'See, I shall shoot that star,
the red one there.' I pulled the string and the arrow was off. We waited to hear it fall. 'It
takes a long time to reach the stars,' I said. Just then there was a splash in the jar by the
tepee door. 'There it is,' said my father, 'your star has fallen into the rain jar.'

This is an atom: 
"I looked, and, sure enough, there was the little red star, lying on the bottom of the crock,
and shining so brightly that we could see it through the water. 'My star!' I said. 'We shall
always keep it here, my father. I brought it down with my arrow.'

This is an atom: 
"The next day my father took me hunting, and he gave orders that that jar was never to be moved
from beside his door until I should leave him, and then it was to go with me. And always he
has kept fresh water from the spring in the jar. See, he has brought it up here beside your
tepee that it would be waiting for me. Yes, my Fir Tree, see, here is my own star still shining
brightly--more brightly to-night because of my great happiness with you."

This is an atom: 
"Dear little Willow Wand, what a beautiful child you are," said Fir Tree, and he brushed back
her black hair and looked into her eyes. "Don't you know that the star in the crock is only
a reflection of a real star above your dear head in the sky? No one can really shoot a star,
Willow Wand."

This is an atom: 
"But of course it is a real star, Fir Tree; we heard it splash as it fell into the jar, my
father and I. And I see it now; it has always been here since that night. You are mistaken,
Fir Tree."

This is an atom: 
Fir Tree rose and lifted up the jar, and, tipping the water out, said, "See, I shall show you
that Fir Tree is never mistaken. I shall empty the crock. See, there is no star left in the
jar, nor has any red star tumbled out with the water onto the grass. Ah, your secret was very
beautiful, little Willow Wand, but now you know the truth. The truth, too, is beautiful."

This is an atom: 
There was a little moan of anguish, and Willow Wand disappeared into the darkness.

This is an atom: 
The next morning a tall squaw came out of Fir Tree's tepee. She picked up the empty rain jar
and with tired footsteps walked down to the spring for water. She was dressed in the conventional
clothing of her tribe, and her face was dull and expressionless like the stones on the path
over which she walked. Down the long trail to the spring she walked. It was very, very early,
so the moon still shone and the little stars twinkled in the sky. Often she looked at them,
longing for her little red star.

This is an atom: 
Slowly she stooped, filled the jar, and lifted it to place it on her head when suddenly she
stopped, looked--then gave a cry of surprise and delight, for there, shining clear as crystal
in the water of the pail, was the little red star.

This is an atom: 
Willow Wand set the jar carefully on the ground and then knelt long beside it. How she loved
the little red star! How happy she was to have it once more beside her! And as she looked,
the tired look left her face and a smile of joy and peace took its place.

This is an atom: 
Picking up the jar, she looked once more into the clear cold water. Then she said,

This is an atom: 
"Come, little star. Come with me to the wigwam of brave, strong Fir Tree. Together we will
make it the happiest wigwam in the encampment. You shall still help me to be my best, for I
shall still have a star."

THE TWO SEARCHERS

This is an atom: 
Peter was tired of doing the same thing over and over and he wanted a change. Ever since he
could remember he had fished and sold the fish he had caught. He had made nets and mended them.
First he had done it for his father, and now he owned the boats and nets and fishing implements.
But he stood on that bright summer day close by the beautiful Lake of Gennesaret in Galilee,
wishing over and over that he could do something that was more worth while.

This is an atom: 
There was a reason why Peter was more discouraged than ever on this morning. He had fished
all through the night before in the hope of getting a good catch so that he might skip a day's
work and go to hear the great teacher about whom men were talking and whom Andrew, his brother,
had seen. But though he had worked hard, not a fish had he caught. So now he was mending the
holes in the net with a very discontented look on his face. What was the use of it all, anyway?
He twisted the rope this way and that, showing by the pulls that he made that his mind was
full of trouble.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly he heard Andrew talking to him. "Peter," he said. "Peter, see the crowd coming over
the hilltop. Perhaps the teacher is coming. And then it was November, the cold i mui grande,
i us such, with little difficulty that we could count the bones

This is an atom:

because the horses were killed, now that the boats were, I never I

WHY ELIZABETH WAS CHOSEN

This is an atom: 
The Triangle Club of Center High School were all busily engaged in choosing the girls whom
they should invite to go to the house party which Mrs. Warren was giving them. Mrs. Warren
had a cottage on a lake, fifteen miles from the city, and she had written to the club saying
that she wanted them all to spend a week with George, her son, there in the camp. And better
still, she was ready to invite any ten girls whom they might choose. Mrs. Warren was the wife
of the minister, so all the boys knew that the mothers of the girls would be glad to have them
spend a week with her at the dear little camp in the pines, about which they had heard so much.

This is an atom: 
One by one they had chosen the girls, each boy having a choice, and now all that was left to
be done was for Carl Green, their president, to choose. But Carl was in an examination, so
they must wait for him.

This is an atom: 
"I think he will choose Charlotte Morey," said one. "She is so pretty and Carl has taken her
to several dances this winter."

This is an atom: 
"Not a bit of it," said another. "He will ask Helen Keats, for she makes such good marks in
school that he is glad to be seen out with her. She is fine company and I hope he asks her."

This is an atom: 
"I think he will ask his sister, Jane. Carl is always thinking of her and if she is at home,
he will ask her first, I am sure," said a third.

This is an atom: 
While they were talking, they saw the boy coming across the lawn in front of the school. Every
boy smiled and eagerly leaned forward to greet him, for Carl Green was easily their hero. He
could lead in sports of all kinds, he was cheery and patient, he was a good student in school--he
was an all-round boy and what he did was right in the eyes of the boys.

This is an atom: 
"Come on, Carl," they called. "Here is a letter from Mrs. Warren telling us we can invite the
girls up for the house party. Isn't she a dear to think of it? We have chosen part of the girls
and here is our list, but you still have a choice. Of course we know whom you will choose,
but we thought we had better let you write the name. Come on! Hurry up."

This is an atom: 
Carl took the list and looked carefully through it. Then he said,

This is an atom: 
"That will be a fine party, fellows. I like that list. Let me see. That is the last week in
June, so Jane will be away. I'm sorry, for I should have liked to have given her the fun. Well,
as long as she can't go, I should like to ask Elizabeth Wyman to go with us."

This is an atom: 
A chorus of boys' voices sounded as soon as the name was spoken.

This is an atom: 
"Elizabeth Wyman! Why do you want her? She doesn't go with our set. She refused to go to the
dance at the beach with us, though the whole club was going. Said she didn't like the movie
we were going to see. She wouldn't vote for the Sunday picnic that we wanted. Oh, Carl, you
don't want her. She would spoil our fun. Choose another."

This is an atom: 
Carl let the boys talk all they chose and then he said,

This is an atom: 
"Fellows, if you insist, I will choose another, but I should prefer to take Elizabeth. I'll
be frank with you, I'm going to go with her if she will let me and this would be a fine opportunity
to get to know her."

This is an atom: 
"If she will let you--that is a joke. As if any girl would not let you," said John.

This is an atom: 
"No," said Carl, "I mean what I say. I am going to be her friend if she will let me. And I'll
tell you why--though I am not sure that she would want me to do it. Still she told me the story
in a very frank way, so I don't think she would mind. At least I hope not. But I want you to
know her in the way I do, for if she is my friend you will be often with her. After I tell
you, you will understand why I say, 'If she will let me.'"

This is an atom: 
"It was the night of the snowstorm and I was coming up the street
  when I caught up with her. It was very cold and she was snuggling
  into a beautiful little neckpiece of ermine. I am fond of furs and so
  I said to her,

This is an atom: 
"'I like the little ermine that you have about your neck. It is so
  simple, yet so beautiful. It is very different from the large ones
  that most people wear these days.'

This is an atom: 
"'Oh,' she said, 'I like it too. Uncle sent it to me this winter and
  I love it because of the story he told me about the little animal
  whose fur it is.'

This is an atom: 
"'Tell me the story,' I said.

This is an atom: 
"But she smiled and patted the fur as she said, 'I don't think I
  could, for it is very personal. It was a message from Uncle to me, so
  it means much to me. To you, it might not mean anything.'

This is an atom: 
"'But I should like to hear it,' I said. 'Please tell it to me.'

This is an atom: 
"'Well,' said Elizabeth, 'Uncle seems very queer to mother because he
  wants a message to go with every gift, but I like it. When this came,
  his letter said:

This is an atom: 
"'"Girlie: I wonder if you wouldn't like to wear this bit of ermine.
  When the ermine is pursued by a larger animal and it comes to a
  puddle of mud, it will die before it will soil its coat. Wouldn't it
  be wonderful if you and all the girls who are your friends would be
  as careful of your characters and never, no never, do that which
  would soil them?"'

This is an atom: 
"We walked part of a block before we spoke after she had told me of
  the gift, and then she said, 'I am sure that the girls at school
  sometimes think me very particular because I will not do some of the
  things that they do. Perhaps they are all right for them but I feel
  that they would soil my coat, so I do not do them. I am trying to
  keep it white and this little bit of ermine helps a lot. Of course, I
  like to wear it, but it would be very uncomfortable if I did not try.
  I hope you don't think me foolish, now that you know the story of the
  fur.'"

This is an atom: 
There was silence as Carl finished speaking. Then Carl Green threw back the long locks from
his forehead as he said,

This is an atom: 
"I know a good thing when I see it, fellows, and the girl who would die rather than soil her
character is a mighty good friend for a boy to have. She is worth asking to our house party.
I'm thinking she is worth winning for a friend. Good-by, I am going to ask her before any of
you change the name on your list."

This is an atom: 
So Elizabeth Wyman went to the house party at Mrs. Warren's, and to this day she wonders why
the boys seemed so different from what they had seemed before. But because she knew no difference,
she was sure that it must have been because she was invited by Carl Green, the leader of the
Triangle Club of Center High School. But you and I know better.

This is an atom: 
JANIE'S SCHOOL DAYS

This is an atom: 
Janie was sixteen years old, but she looked as though she might be only thirteen as she sat
on the front seat of the little schoolhouse far up on the mountainside of Kentucky. Her black
hair was plastered tightly to her head. Her calico dress was much too long and the sleeves
were much too short. Mother had made it long so that she might wear it for several years, while
the sleeves were short so that she might have no excuse for not getting her hands in the dish
water. Her bare feet were very dirty but her face shone from its recent scrubbing.

This is an atom: 
This was a great day for Janie, for the missionary had once again come to the schoolhouse.
It had been three years since she was there before, and all that time Janie had waited for
her. So she had hurried with her work in order that she might sit on the very front seat and
hear every word. Last time she had told much about the school many miles away and Janie had
said over and over to herself, "I shall go there; I shall go there." But of course it was foolish
to say so, for there wasn't any chance that she ever could go. Why, there were seven brothers
and sisters younger than she, and she had to work all day long to help to get them enough to
eat. She could never go.

This is an atom: 
But she listened eagerly as the missionary told of all that was being done in the little schoolhouses
all about the mountains and of the need of teachers to do the work.

This is an atom: 
"We like best to take a boy or girl from some hamlet and let them work with us for several
years and then send them back to their own homes to serve there. I am wondering if there isn't
a girl here who would like to be the teacher here and help to make Round Creek what it ought
to be. If there is such a one, send them to us and we will do our best. If you will pay $10
a term, we will do the rest."

This is an atom: 
Janie's little body was leaning far forward and her eyes were big with excitement. She knew
a girl that would like to go. But $10 a term! Why, one dollar seemed big in their home. So
she crept out into the darkness of the night without saying a word to any one about her great,
big longing. But up in the loft of the log house she lay long after the rest went to sleep
trying to think of a way. Auntie was coming to stay with them in the fall. If she could just
get the ten dollars by that time, maybe she could be spared for a term. That would help a little,
anyway.

This is an atom: 
In the morning she loosened one of the boards of the woodshed. Beneath it she placed a little
tin can, and in the can she put the five pennies that she owned. It was berry time and she
thought she knew of a way to earn some money that should be all her own. Near the mill, there
were beautiful pieces of bark. In the woods there were many rare ferns. She would make some
little baskets like she had made many times for the home, fill them with ferns and try to sell
them when she went into the town with the berries. It meant getting up at four instead of five,
but she could do that. It meant getting the ferns when the rest of the children were playing
at lunch time--but that wasn't hard. And after her first day in town she had fifty cents to
put into the cup. Oh, how rich she felt!

This is an atom: 
An extra quart of berries here and there, some flowers sold from her little garden patch on
the hill, two little kittens sold instead of being drowned--and so the money in the cup grew
very, very slowly and no one dreamed it was there. But her dream grew with the contents of
the cup. She could see herself all dressed in a neat dress going up the hill to the school
and the little children following her and calling her teacher.

This is an atom: 
But in August, George fell from the hay-mow and for days he lay there white and still. Mother
had done all she could and there was no money to send for the doctor. Then it was that a little
black-haired girl went out in the shed and for the first time counted the money in the cup--one,
two, three, four, five, six, almost seven dollars. Long she looked at it. Then she went into
town to do the errand for her mother and five of the precious dollars were counted into the
hands of the doctor with the repeated statement,

This is an atom: 
"Tell mother that you happened to be going by and just stopped, so all she needs to pay you
is a dollar, for she has that."

This is an atom: 
So mother never knew, nor did the sick boy know, of the sacrifice the girl had made. Auntie
came and went, and because it was winter the money in the cup hardly increased one bit. Sometimes
she was almost discouraged, but then she would say to herself,

This is an atom: 
"Why, it took years and years for Abraham Lincoln to get to the White House. It doesn't matter
if it takes twenty years. I am going to get to that schoolhouse. I will be a teacher."

This is an atom: 
She could crochet and she could embroider, so these helped a bit. She planted more things in
her own garden and the money from these was her own. So again as the summer drew to a close,
she knew there must be several dollars in the cup--but she daren't count it, for if it should
be ten and still she couldn't go--oh, that would be worse than all!

This is an atom: 
It was five days before school was to open that there came a letter from grandmother saying
that she was coming to stay for the winter, and while mother was happy over this, Janie asked
if she might not be spared to go to school. At first there was a firm "No" for an answer. But
she begged so hard to be allowed to go for only one term that she saw signs of relenting in
her mother's face. Then she ran to get the cup--and in it was nearly nine dollars.

This is an atom: 
Where should she get the rest? Mother had none--yet she must have it. There was only one way.
She could sell Biddy, her pet hen whom she loved so much. She would ask her brother to take
her in the morning, for she could never do it herself. So with tears in her eyes, she patted
her pet and put it into a box ready for the morning. Oh! ten dollars was such a lot of money
for a little girl to get!

This is an atom: 
It was thirty miles to the school, so she had only one day to get ready. But she had few clothes
and so it was an easy matter. She put them neatly in a bundle and with a queer feeling underneath
the little red dress, now too short instead of too long, she started bright and early to walk
the thirty miles to school. Many times she turned to look back at the little log cabin till
it was hidden from her sight by a turn in the road. Then somehow she felt very much alone in
the world.

This is an atom: 
On and on she walked till at last, twenty miles from home, she came to the home of an old neighbor
and rested for the night. It was two in the afternoon of the next day when she saw in the distance
the large brick building which she knew must be the school. She longed to run to it but her
feet were very sore and her body was very tired. So she trudged on till she came to the office.

This is an atom: 
"Please, Miss, I have come to school. I can only stay one term but I came anyway and here is
the money. The missionary lady said you would do the rest," and she handed her the precious money.

This is an atom: 
"And to whom did you write about entering?" said the lady kindly.

This is an atom: 
"To nobody. You see I didn't know I could come till Tuesday," said Janie.

This is an atom: 
"Well, I am so sorry," said the lady, "but you see we have all the girls we can possibly take.
So we can't have you this term. Perhaps you could come next term if you leave your name now."

This is an atom: 
The whole world seemed to fall from under Janie's feet. She was here, thirty miles from home.
She had all the money--she had sold dear old Biddy--yet she could not stay. Not a word did
she answer. She just stood and stared into space.

This is an atom: 
"I am very tired for I have walked thirty miles to get here. May I stay just for to-night?"
she asked, rolling the ten dollars carefully in her big handkerchief.

This is an atom: 
"School doesn't open till to-morrow but we will tuck you in somewhere for to-night. I am so
sorry for you, but we just haven't a bit of room after to-morrow. Sit down on the porch and
rest yourself," said the lady.

This is an atom: 
She brought her a glass of milk and then left her alone with her thoughts. How could she go
home? Perhaps there would never come a time when she could be spared again. Was there no way
in which she could stay?

This is an atom: 
Ten minutes later, a little girl in a short red calico dress went down the steps and along
the street, looking for a doctor's sign. When she found it, she rang the bell and asked for
the doctor.

This is an atom: 
"Please, sir," she said, "I thought you might know some one who wanted a girl to work for them.
I want to go to school this term and I have earned the money to come. And now that I am here,
there is no place for me and I must walk the thirty miles back. But I am willing to work. I
will work for nothing if only I can go to the school in the afternoon. Sir, I just must be
a teacher and I just must stay now and get started."

This is an atom: 
The doctor whistled a little tune before he answered. "And tell me how you earned the money
to come." Then he whistled another tune as she talked. "Stay here to-night," he said. "I will
find out at the school just how much they will let you come in the afternoons. I am sure you
can find work enough, so don't worry."

This is an atom: 
And sure enough, he found a place for her and so she started with the rest on the very first
morning. She was radiantly happy till she heard a boy say,

This is an atom: 
"Look at the red dress that is coming in! Better loan her a red handkerchief to piece it down
with."

This is an atom: 
Then she knew that she was different from the rest. Her shoes were coarse and rough. Her hair
looked, oh, so different. Her hands were red and big. She was here where she had longed to
come but oh, how unhappy she was! She was almost ready to cry. Instead she shook her head proudly
and said to herself, "I will be a teacher. What do I care if they laugh?"

This is an atom: 
The lessons were very hard, for her preparation was not good; every minute that she could spare
she must spend on getting ready for the next day, so she had little time to be lonely. But
she still minded the fact that her clothes were so very different. Many a good cry she had
in the quiet of her little room as she looked at the red dress laid out for the coming day.

This is an atom: 
The term sped by and she was making good. Oh, if she could only stay! But she had no money
except the little that the good doctor had given her now and then for doing errands for him.
She could take her books home and perhaps she could do it all by herself.

This is an atom: 
So she waited till almost the last day before she told the woman for whom she worked that she
was leaving.

This is an atom: 
"Why, girlie," she answered, "you have much more than ten dollars coming from me. I have never
paid you because the doctor told me you would ask for it if you needed it. I will give it to
you and then you can go and pay your ten dollars. I wouldn't have you go home for anything."

This is an atom: 
Clasping her precious money in her hand, she flew up the stairs. Here was a letter from her
brother also. What a happy day! Eagerly she opened it and read,

This is an atom: 
"Mother is counting on your coming home for we need your help badly. The cow has died and we
are without milk till we can get another. Mother thinks she must spare you at home and let
you work out to earn money."

This is an atom: 
Oh! Oh! She was needed! She must take the money she had earned to help to buy a cow and again
she must forget school. So she went again to her mistress, told her story and began to prepare
for the long walk. She went to the school, borrowed the books, and promised them she would
surely come again. Then she went again to the old doctor who had been so kind to her.

This is an atom: 
He listened thoughtfully as she told him of her new plans which still had not changed her vision
of being a teacher.

This is an atom: 
"I will come back, even though it be after four or five years. I will come," she said, and
she rose to go.

This is an atom: 
Then the doctor turned to his desk and took from it the picture of a girl.

This is an atom: 
"That was my little girl," he said. "She, too, wanted to be a teacher and she was in this very
school when sickness and death came. When you came to me that first morning and said, 'I just
must be a teacher,' I could hear her say to me, 'Help her.' So I did what you asked me to do--got
you a place to work for nothing though I knew you were to be paid. I have watched you work,
I have watched you suffer because of the red dress; I have watched you try to do your duty
at the sacrifice of yourself. And now that you have done all that you can, I am ready to do
the rest. Send the money that you have earned to your mother to help to buy the cow. Come to
live here and be my office girl. The money that you earn can go to your mother for I will do
for you what I would have done for her and I will do it for her sake and because you have shown
me that you are worth while. You _shall_ be a teacher."

This is an atom: 
So Janie lived in the home of her new friend. There was help on her lessons, the old red dress
went back to the little home in the hills to be worn by some one whom it would fit and in her
new, pretty things she could see more plainly--Janie, the teacher.

This is an atom: 
SELF-MADE MEN

This is an atom: 
The banqueting hall of Hotel Northland was crowded to its limit. There were noted men and women
from all walks of life. There were many from humble homes. There were those whose beautiful
dresses showed that money meant little to them; there were others to whom the price of the
banquet ticket had meant sacrifice. It was a merry company that awaited the coming of the guests
of the evening.

This is an atom: 
Cheer after cheer arose when the tall, fine-looking young man took his seat near the center
of the guest's table. He was the newly elected mayor of the city--the youngest mayor they had
ever had. He had risen from the ranks and many of the humbler folk knew him well as a boy.
Oh, how proud they were of him!

This is an atom: 
Then again the cheers sounded as an old white-haired lady entered and was placed at the left
of the mayor. She it was who had given them their college, their library, their playground.
For years and years she had been living away from the town, but still she loved them all and
gave of her wealth to make them happy. Her friends were many in the great banqueting hall.

This is an atom: 
The supper was served and the tables cleared and then the mayor rose to speak. He told of his
boyhood, of his struggles at school and college, of his eagerness to enter the political field,
of his happiness at his recent election.

This is an atom: 
"I believe that every man is master of his own fate. I believe in being a self-made man and
I mean during these next years when I am to serve you to make it possible for every boy to
push his way to a career. One can make himself what he will if only he has grit and courage.
I am here to serve you all," he said.

This is an atom: 
Not once during the address had the eyes of the little, white-haired lady been taken from the
speaker. She seemed studying him rather than his address. So intent was she that she hardly
heard the toastmaster introducing her as the friend whom all delighted to honor. Dreamily she
arose and said,

This is an atom: 
"Years and years ago, in this very town there lived a teacher who had ten bright, happy girls
in a club. For four years they had played and worked together and they loved each other dearly.
Then the husband of the teacher was taken ill and it became necessary for the teacher to go
to another continent to live.

This is an atom: 
"How hard it was for the girls to have her go! But it was harder still for her, for she had
wanted to help them through to womanhood. She had tried to help them to see the best but often
she had felt that her efforts were all too small. The day came nearer for her to leave and
she had asked the girls to spend the last evening with her in her home.

This is an atom: 
"And they came, each bringing in their hands a little letter, sealed tightly. They were steamer
letters for their teacher and they had been written because they had heard her say that she
wished she could take with her some idea as to what the girls wanted to be when they had grown,
so that she might be thinking of their plans, even though she could not be there to help with
them. One by one they laid them on the table till there were ten little letters--heart-to-heart
letters to their dear friend.

This is an atom: 
"Five days later, away out in mid-ocean, the teacher opened the letters and read them over
and over to herself. How much they told of the girls!

This is an atom: 
"Jennie wanted to be a great singer; she wanted to go to New York and study and then go into
Grand Opera.

This is an atom: 
"Katherine wanted to be a Kindergarten teacher. Ah! she had found that because of helping in
the church.

This is an atom: 
"Mary wanted to be a lawyer--a criminal lawyer. Perhaps that desire had grown in their debating
club.

This is an atom: 
"Louise wanted to be a nurse. What a dear faithful girl she had been in helping with the bandages
after the great fire in the city!

This is an atom: 
"So one by one she read their letters and her heart was filled with gratitude that to her it
had been given to mold in a little way their lives."

This is an atom: 
Then turning to the mayor of the city, the little white-haired lady said,

This is an atom: 
"Sir, the contents of one of those letters will be of interest to you more than to the rest.
I was the teacher of those girls, so I can give you the exact wording of the last letter that
I read,

This is an atom: 
"'Dear friend: You have asked us to give you our dearest wish. I have many wishes for the future
but the wish that I want most of all is to be a fine woman and some day to be a real mother,
the kind you have so often told us about.'

This is an atom: 
"The girl who wrote that letter, sir, became your mother. Fourteen years before you were born,
your character was being formed, your ideals were being molded, your future was being safeguarded.
I congratulate you, sir, on being elected to the office of mayor; but I congratulate you more
for being the child of my little girl of the long ago who at sixteen could write, 'I want most
of all to be a fine, noble woman and some day to be a real mother.' To her you owe much. Inspire
the girls of the town if you plan for great men. A self-made man needs a real mother to build
the foundations of his character. There is no other way."

This is an atom: 
Then the speaker sat down and there was silence in the banqueting hall.

This is an atom: 
ON THE ROAD TO WOMANHOOD

This is an atom: 
In their hands the girls carried a scroll; on their backs they carried a bundle, and they were
five in number--five girls with rosy cheeks and healthy bodies. But now their cheeks were browned
by the sun and their shoulders drooped as they walked by the way.

This is an atom: 
For they had walked and walked and walked as the morning had turned into noon, and now the
afternoon shadows were already falling on the way. Then as the search seemed almost useless,
they saw her--the one for whom they had come; the one into whose hands they wished to place
their scrolls. Eagerly they watched her as she came slowly toward them dressed in shining white--the
Angel Who Rights Things.

This is an atom: 
When she smiled, they found courage to speak.

This is an atom: 
"We have come to search for you but we thought we should never find you," said the oldest of
the girls. "We can never grow strong and beautiful if we carry these heavy burdens on our backs.
They are much too large for us and we do not like them. We have come to ask you to take them
away and make us free. Lo! we have written it all here in our scrolls."

This is an atom: 
But the Fairy Who Rights Things drew back as the five handed to her the scrolls which they carried.

This is an atom: 
"Take away the burdens!" said she. "Oh, no, I could never do that. He that carrieth no burden
gaineth no strength. All must carry if they would grow."

This is an atom: 
"But we do not like them. If we must have a burden, might we not exchange them? Surely all
our friends do not have burdens to carry. We have watched them and we know they have none,"
said another girl.

This is an atom: 
"You are quite mistaken," said the fairy. "All have burdens to carry. But I can let you choose
if you will exchange your own. Let me see what you have brought."

This is an atom: 
"Well," said the first. "Here is mine. I have to go to school. Now father has plenty of money
and I shall never have to work. Why should I study and do all the hard work of the school?
I hate it all and I want to be free from it. I want to live at home and read, and play, and
do as I like."

This is an atom: 
"And here is mine," said the second, lifting it from her back. "I have to go to church every
Sunday when I want to sleep. There is nothing there for me and I am so tired of it. But father
and mother insist that I go, at least in the morning. I want to be free from the church."

This is an atom: 
"Oh," said the third. "I don't mind school and I don't mind going to church but I do mind having
to help at home. It is iron and sweep and wash dishes; then wash dishes and sweep and iron.
Always something to do when I am in the house. I hate housework and I want to be free from
doing it. Mother says all girls should help at home. But it is a big burden."

This is an atom: 
"My burden is quite different from the others," said the fourth. "I cannot dress as I choose.
I must wear heavy clothes and low heels. I must dress my hair as if I were old and tidy. All
the girls do differently and I want to be like them. Really my burden makes me very unhappy.
Please let me change it."

This is an atom: 
Then the fairy turned to the last girl, who had been resting her burden against a stone wall.

This is an atom: 
"What have you here, dear?" she said kindly. "Your burden seems weighing you down. Let me help
you open it."

This is an atom: 
"Oh dear," said the girl, and the big tears welled up in her eyes. "This is my home life. Nobody
seems to understand me. They scold and fret and fuss all the time. Mother is cross and the
children are always bothering me. I want to go away from home and work for my living and then
board as the other girls do. I should love to have a little room in a boarding-house where
the girls could come to see me. My burden grows heavier and heavier and I am also very unhappy."

This is an atom: 
"Well, well, well," said the Fairy Who Rights Things. "It looks as if I had a big task. All
of you seem to be unhappy, but then we are usually unhappy because we look at ourselves instead
of others. Let's try what these magic spectacles can do. They will show you the burdens some
of your friends carry and also show you how they carry them."

This is an atom: 
Then she fitted a pair to the eyes of each girl and they looked at the passers-by.

This is an atom: 
There was Kate, who was always smiling and happy. Her burden was almost as large as she. There
was a sick mother away back on the little farm in the country. Kate was trying to support her
and still have enough to keep her own expenses paid. Her days were full of work. In her room,
she was sewing to make extra money. She was very lonely, for she loved the little mother and
longed to be with her, but she must earn money. Oh! what a pile of worries she had on every
side! How could she ever carry them? But beneath the pile as it rested on her back they saw
a little lever that was lifting all the time--and the lever was _Love_.

This is an atom: 
And here was May. They had money and automobiles and everything to make her happy. She had
never seemed to have any burden but now she was carrying a very large one. She wanted to go
to college, she wanted to make her life worth while, but her parents wanted her to stay at
home and play the hours away. They would not let her go and as the months went by she longed
more and more to study and serve. Did she have a lever to help carry hers? Indeed she did.
It was right under the burden and it was called _Vision_.

This is an atom: 
Then there was Tom, the baseball star. He too carried a burden. They had never known that he
had a father. But he carried the burden of a father who drank and drank. Oh, what a shame to
take him through the streets in such a helpless condition! Did Tom have a lever? All looked
eagerly to see and they saw _Ideals_--he would have a spotless character and retrieve the family
name.

This is an atom: 
And there was Helen. Her people used profane language and she loved the pure. They loved the
world and she loved the ideals of the church. They made fun of her faith and tried to change
it. How heavily she was loaded, yet they had never dreamed of it when they had seen her teaching
her little class in the Church School. But _Belief in God_ was helping her to carry her load.

This is an atom: 
So they passed along the way before the five girls. All were carrying something but not all
were carrying their load alike. Some smiled, and some sang as they staggered beneath a heavy
load; others groaned and fretted with the weight of a much lighter one. Some were not only
carrying their own load but helping to carry others.

This is an atom: 
"And now," said the Angel Who Rights Things, "do you see a load that you would prefer? If so,
then I will ask the bearer to exchange with you. Will you choose by the size of the burden
or the ease with which it is carried?"

This is an atom: 
But though they searched long and diligently, they found no load easier than their own.

This is an atom: 
At last one turned to the Angel and said, "We find no one to choose. And since we must carry
a burden, will you tell us how best we may carry these?"

This is an atom: 
Then the face of the Angel lighted with pleasure till it glowed like the sun. "When one asks
_how_ to carry and not _why_ he must carry, already the load is lighter," she replied. "If
you will, your school can give to you a vision that will make your load seem very easy; your
church can give to you a love that will make you eager to go there and learn to serve; your
home cares can give you ideals for your own little home some day; your mother can show you
how to grow into beautiful womanhood if you will but give her a chance; your troubles at home
can give to you a sympathy that will not only lift your own burden but help with those of others.
All these levers that you have seen helping to lift loads have been right at your hand to help
you if you would only have given them an opportunity.

This is an atom: 
"How shall you bear your burdens? With a smile on your face, and love in your heart, and any
_lifter_ that you can find."

This is an atom: 
Then the Angel Who Rights Things went on her way to find others who groaned beneath their burdens
because they had never learned how to carry them.

This is an atom: 
HER PRAYER

This is an atom: 
Every time the King automobile went past the little home of Julia Lowe when Julia was there,
she ran eagerly to look into the face of the lady who sat inside. She had such beautiful clothes;
she sat so tall and stately; she had such a wonderful smile. She was Julia Lowe's ideal woman.

This is an atom: 
Julia had gone with two other girls to ask Mrs. King to help them with their Liberty Loans
and she had not only taken bonds but had given them flowers from the great garden back of the
house, and had invited them to come again. Every time she saw her go by, Julia wished she,
too, might have such a sweet face and such a heap of good things as Mrs. King had.

This is an atom: 
Now Julia worked in an office downtown, so, of course she thought she had to act and to do
as the other girls in the office did. When they wore their hair very straight, hers was straight
also; but when they wore puffs, she had to get up much earlier in the morning to force her
pretty hair into great puffs over her ears. Mother wanted her to wear serge dresses in the
office, but the other girls wore georgette waists, so of course she had to wear them also.
Some of the girls in the neighborhood liked to go to the library to read, so they had formed
a club for that purpose and had asked Julia to join. But the girls in the office liked to go
to dances and picture shows, and so she must go to them also--else how could she talk things
over with them at the noon hour, and tell them of the boys she had been with, and the places
where she had gone? Oh, yes, she just must do as the girls in the office did. But in spite
of it all, she wasn't very happy and sometimes she wished she could run away from it all and
just go back to school again as her mother had wanted her to do.

This is an atom: 
When she looked at Mrs. King, somehow her beautiful face seemed to make her want more than
ever to do better. What was there about her that made Julia love her at a distance and yet
be afraid of her when she came near her? Julia didn't know. But she did know that deep in her
heart she wanted to be like her and didn't know how. If only she had money and beautiful things,
perhaps it would be different.

This is an atom: 
One day when the leaves were very beautiful in their fall colors, a dainty little note was
left by the postman for Julia and it read,

This is an atom: 
"Dear Julia:

This is an atom: 
"I hardly know you but I am going to ask a great favor of you. Mr.
  King has been called out of town and he is not willing to have me
  stay in the house all alone, for it is very big and lonely since Mary
  died. I wish very much that you would let me call for you at the
  office this afternoon. Then we will go out in the country to see the
  beautiful colors and have our supper at the Country Club. Then, when
  we come home in the moonlight, I should like to have you spend the
  night with me here. I shall hope that you can come.

This is an atom: 
"Sincerely,

This is an atom: 
"Margaret L. King."

This is an atom: 
Julia was so happy as she read it that she could hardly contain herself--to go for a ride in
the wonderful car; to eat at the Country Club; to sleep at the home of Mrs. King--why, she
had never even dared to dream of such a thing. It was too good to be true.

This is an atom: 
Of course she must look her very best, so she asked for an extra half hour at noon. She would
wear her new thin waist with the very low neck, for the girls had told her that she looked
"too sweet for anything" in that. Her silk skirt was shabby but it would never do to wear her
serge, even if it were new, when she rode with Mrs. King. As she put on the high-heeled slippers,
she noticed that they were much run over, but they would have to do. It took her a long, long
time to fix her hair just as she wanted to have it, for one dip must just touch the next at
the right angle.

This is an atom: 
Finally all was ready but the extra touches to her face. There was the rouge for which she
had spent so much money. The boss at the office had told them that they would lose their job
if they came with it on their faces again but she must risk it this once. A little penciling
of the eyebrows, a little powder here and there, and Julia felt very sure as she looked at
herself in the glass that she would "do."

This is an atom: 
Her shoes needed brushing but she hadn't time for them, for, even now, she had only time to
run as fast as she could to get the car which would bring her to the office in time. There
was a button off her coat which she had forgotten, but the coat needn't be worn; her fingernails
needed attention, but she never cared much about them. As long as her face, and her hair, and
her clothes were all in style, she was all right to go anywhere.

This is an atom: 
Promptly at five, the King car came to the door of the factory and Julia stepped in, followed
by the envious glances of her friends in the office. What a ride it was through the open country!
Miles and miles of beauty such as Julia had never seen. Mrs. King found so many interesting
things for her to see that all the restraint wore away, and she found herself talking to her
friend and telling her all about her own life and pleasures.

This is an atom: 
Then Mrs. King told her a little about what she did with her time and, to her surprise, Julia
found that Mrs. King was a very busy woman. Over and over as they talked, Julia noticed how
soft and sweet Mrs. King's voice was and how carefully she used the best of English. And again,
Julia found herself wishing she were like Mrs. King. Somehow she did not care to use the slang
words that seemed so necessary when she talked with the girls.

This is an atom: 
When their coats were removed at the Country Club, Julia found that Mrs. King was very simply
dressed in a dark blue serge dress with little white collar and cuffs. Many other girls and
women in the group were dressed in the same way. Then Julia became suddenly conscious of the
run-over heels and the torn skirt, for she and Mrs. King were in the center of the room, and
she was being introduced as "My friend Julia." How she did wish she had taken mother's advice
and worn the new, pretty serge!

This is an atom: 
In one of the corners of the dining-room there was a little table for two that overlooked the
lake, and towards this Mrs. King made her way. Here they could see every one and yet be quite
alone. Then Mrs. King told her a little of the people in the room. Here was the wife of a noted
judge; that was the High School teacher of whom she must have heard the girls speak if they
had ever been to that school.

This is an atom: 
"And who are these two girls in front of us?" asked Julia. "Isn't the dark-haired one a beauty?
Evidently the young man with her thinks so, too."

This is an atom: 
Then Mrs. King's face grew quiet as she said,

This is an atom: 
"Those are two girls of whom we are very fond here, but I am so sorry to see Jessie doing as
she is. No, Julia, she is not pretty. She has painted her face and all her natural beauty is
hidden. Usually she is very attractive. Her friend's face is sweet and clean. Evidently she
does not care to attract attention to herself by the use of paint and rouge. She believes in
being true to her best self even though she is not in the height of style. When you have lived
longer, you will know, dear, the truth of what I say."

This is an atom: 
Poor Julia. Her face burned like fire. Mrs. King had said "My friend Julia," yet she, too,
had paint on her face--not red like the girl in front, to be sure, but it was there. Why had
no one told her before? All the girls did it and she thought it was the thing to do. Then there
came to her an impulse to ask Mrs. King about it, so she said frankly,

This is an atom: 
"Mrs. King, I have some paint on my face, too, but I put it on because I was coming out with
you. I thought you would like to have me look my very best."

This is an atom: 
"Indeed I do, girlie," said Mrs. King, putting her hand on the hand of the girl opposite her.
"Indeed I do want you to look your best. I have liked you ever since I came to Hillcrest to
live and it has hurt me to see you trying to do as all the other girls did. I have wished so
often that you would be a leader in doing the finer things and help others to see what real
beauty is and how to get it. As the Indians came i truxeron Andres Dorantes, Caftillo i à i à

This is an atom: 
She was almost sorry when it came time to go home.

This is an atom: 
In the house, a great fire was burning and it looked so cozy.

This is an atom: 
"I have looked into your windows many times as I have passed and wished I could sit before
the fire and dream and dream," said the girl. "May I sit down here for a while?"

This is an atom: 
"We will both sit here," said Mrs. King, "then I will tell you about my little girl who used
to sit here with me."

This is an atom: 
How Julia's heart ached for her friend as she told her of her love for her own dear girl, of
the plans they had made, of the sudden sickness and death, and of the loneliness of the big
house since she had gone! She had thought Mrs. King had everything to make her happy, yet the
thing she wanted most she could not have.

This is an atom: 
"Her hair was much like yours and sometimes, as you have passed, I have wished I could comb
yours as I did hers. Would you mind if I did?" said the mother.

This is an atom: 
"I should love to have you," said Julia.

This is an atom: 
"Well, then, when the fire has died out, we will go up to her room. In the drawer there I have
a little white dress that perhaps you would like. I will comb your hair just as I did hers
and see if the dress will fit you," said Mrs. King. "If you look sweet and girlish in it, I
will give it to you."

This is an atom: 
While Mrs. King slipped away to get the things needed for the hairdressing, Julia went to the
great white bathroom, and when she came out her face was sweet and clean and every trace of
the paint and powder was gone. Her pretty brown hair was down her back in ringlets and her
face wore a look which the girls at the office had never seen there.

This is an atom: 
Then Mrs. King brushed, and brushed, and brushed till the hair was soft and shiny. Low in her
neck she coiled it, making it look girlish and neat, fastening it with a tiny velvet circlet.
Then Julia held her breath as Mrs. King took from a drawer a little white dress. It was a simple
silk mull but it was prettily made. Below it was a dainty petticoat and at the bottom of the
drawer were white oxfords and fine, lisle stockings.

This is an atom: 
"These were ready for her graduation, dear, but she never wore them once after they were made,"
said the mother softly, as she fingered the dress lovingly.

This is an atom: 
There were tears in the eyes of the mother and tears in the eyes of the girl as the dress was
put on. And when Julia looked into the mirror she seemed to see a strange girl. How little
she looked like the girls in the office! But she liked her hair--and she liked the looks of
her face--and she loved the simple, white dress.

This is an atom: 
Last of all Mrs. King slipped about her neck a little string of pearls. "These are my gift
to you, Julia," she said. "Wear them when you think you are dressed as you and I have planned
to-night and be as beautiful as the pearls. Remember, dear, we may put beautiful things on
the outside but they can never make us beautiful. It comes from the inside because of what
we are. It stands the test of study. It is always real. A girl who does not live up to the
best she knows can well be called a coward. Good night, dear, I am glad there is a girlie who
loves me."

This is an atom: 
Then with a good-night kiss she was gone--gone, as Julia knew, to be more than ever lonely
for her own little girl.

This is an atom: 
For a long time Julia stood looking at the dress, and the slippers, and the stockings. Mrs.
King had plenty of money, yet these were to have been her daughter's graduation clothes. And
she had not finished school because she could not have clothes like the rest of the girls who
were to have expensive ones. Mrs. King was honored all through the city, yet she was dressed
in a simple serge dress at the Country Club. It was all very strange! Some one had things very
much mixed up concerning what a girl should wear. How long it seemed since she had left the
office in the afternoon!

This is an atom: 
The room was so dainty that it took Julia a long time to get ready for bed. How she would love
to have a room like this! Maybe it would be easy to be good. She looked at the dress again,
as she laid it carefully over the chair. It was all hers. The girls would laugh at her but
she loved it. Then she lifted the little string of pearls--not cheap, big ones such as she
had worn on Sunday, but dainty, beautiful ones, and they whispered again to her,

This is an atom: 
"Be as beautiful as the beads, girlie. True beauty is never put on from the outside. It comes
from inside because of what you are."

This is an atom: 
Long she stood in the moonlight near the window looking at them. Then she dropped on her knees
and said,

This is an atom: 
"Dear God, she has shown me the best. Help me not to be a coward as I go out and try to do
it. Help me to be as beautiful as the pearls. I thank Thee for to-day. I want to show others
what real beauty is and how to get it. Please help me."

This is an atom: 
And the Father heard the prayer of the girl kneeling there in her white night-gown, for it
came from a sincere heart--and He answered.

This is an atom: 
THE BEST DAY

This is an atom: 
By Mrs. Annie G. Freeman

This is an atom: 
One sunny summer afternoon Margaret sat reading beneath the shade of an old apple tree. Before
her stretched a charming view but on her face was a troubled, dissatisfied look.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, dear," she sighed. "Even this book is stupid. It is the dullest, most stupid day that
I ever saw."

This is an atom: 
"Stupid day?" said a tiny voice. There on the rock before her sat the daintiest little golden-haired
fairy that she had ever seen. The fairy's feet were resting on a woodbine vine that was creeping
up the wall, and her wings were as delicate as those of a butterfly.

This is an atom: 
"What makes such a bright day as this stupid?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, I suppose it is myself," said the discontented girl.

This is an atom: 
"I believe it is," said the fairy. "Now I will take you with me to the Palace of Time and you
shall choose a day that suits you better. Come."

This is an atom: 
Over green meadows, through pleasant pastures, beside babbling brooks that sparkled and played
in the sunshine, the fairy led. At last they came to the Palace of Time. The fairy led the
way up the long hall to the throne on which Time sat, and told her errand.

This is an atom: 
"Take the little friend to the Hall of Days," he said, "and give her the day that pleases her
best."

This is an atom: 
How delighted the maiden was! Wouldn't you be if a fairy should take you out of a stupid day
and promise you the day that pleased you most? She just skipped along, her feet scarcely touching
the ground in her joy. In a great room filled with all kinds of bright lights, they stopped.

This is an atom: 
"This is the Hall of Days," said the fairy. "Take whichever day pleases you most."

This is an atom: 
Like great balls of glass the days were of many colors and of many kinds. Some were dark and
some were light; some were dim and others clear.

This is an atom: 
One was like a crystal and the odor of roses seemed to come from it. Its colors were soft and
Margaret gazed deep into it. Vague dreams seemed to come from it and memories happy and delightful.
But she couldn't live on dreams and memories. That wouldn't do. She might like that sort of
a day once in a while but her young life demanded something to do on the best day. This was
a day that had gone.

This is an atom: 
One other day pleased her much. It shone like the sun on the new fallen snow. It was so white
and so pure that she lifted it carefully lest she should soil and spot it.

This is an atom: 
"It is too bright. It hurts my eyes," said she, putting it back.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, little girl," said the fairy. "That is to-morrow. It must be shaded by many things before
one can bear it."

This is an atom: 
Then, just between the two, Margaret spied the most beautiful ball of all. It wavered and shimmered;
now it was red, now green, now yellow and now pink. Oh, there were so many colors that she
could not name them all. Wave upon wave of color swept through it and all seemed shot with
the golden lights.

This is an atom: 
"That is the one that I want," she cried happily. "That is the most beautiful day of all."

This is an atom: 
"Take it, then," said the fairy. "It is yours."

This is an atom: 
All the way home, the maiden clasped it tightly.

This is an atom: 
"With this day," she said, "I can be joyful. With this day I can make so many people happy,
and it is so bright that I can see the best way in which to go. It is as light as a feather.
I can hardly wait to show my friends the beautiful day that I have chosen, for I love it dearly."

This is an atom: 
"Yes, indeed," said the fairy, as she flew off in a different direction. "It is a wonderful
day. Infinite wisdom and love helped you to choose aright. That is To-day."

This is an atom: 
"What a beautiful day!" said the maiden as she sat in the shade of the old apple tree. "I believe
I have been dreaming. But this is too beautiful a day to idle it away. I will go and do something
for some one to make others see its beauty also."

This is an atom: 
IN THE WAY

This is an atom: 
Gladys Mercer sat looking at a snapshot which had come to her from one of her girl friends.
It showed a strong, athletic woman with a blanket rolled over her back hiking along the road
and with her six girls in middies and bloomers. And as Gladys looked at the picture, she smiled
at the memories which it brought.

This is an atom: 
There was the long hike, the tired muscles, the view from the mountaintop, the wonderful sunset,
the stillness of the night and the fear of the dark. Then there was the voice of the woman
in the picture,

This is an atom: 
"Girls, you are safer here than in any house you could find. Just remember that God is over
all and sleep as sound as can be."

This is an atom: 
Then there was the sunrise, the pancake breakfast on the hill, and the hike home. Best of all
there had been two long days with Mrs. Fuller, the friend of girls. What a good visit they
had had with her! What a fine story she had told them at the sunset! What a helpful prayer
she had made as they closed their good-night song when the sun went down!

This is an atom: 
And then from the thought of the trip, Gladys went to the thought of all that Mrs. Fuller had
meant to her. She was sunny; she was happy in her work through the day, and happy to give her
time to them at night; she was always ready to advise and help; she seemed to know just what
to do when they did not know; somehow she could always get them to do the thing they had thought
they would not do. She was to Gladys, the motherless girl, a friend, a companion, a leader
and a heroine.

This is an atom: 
What was there about her that made her able to lead? Was it her smile? Was it her ability to
do things? What made a leader anyway?

This is an atom: 
Gladys leaned far back against the old tree under which she had been sitting and said to herself,
"I wish--I wish----"

This is an atom: 
"And what do you wish," said a little voice, and there close to her was a dear little lady
dressed in red and in her hand she carried a lamp.

This is an atom: 
"Who are you?" said Gladys.

This is an atom: 
"I am the Fairy of Helpful Service," said the little lady. "I heard you talking about one of
my helpers, so I was interested to know what you wished when you thought of all she had done
for you girls. Now tell me. What do you wish?"

This is an atom: 
"If you are a fairy, perhaps you can give me my wish. I wish to be like Mrs. Fuller. I want
to help girls. I want to get the kind of letters she gets from girls who are far away. I want
to see 'my girls' some day giving service all over the world as she does. I want to be like
her. Please, fairy, give me my wish."

This is an atom: 
"I can't make you like her but I can put you in the way of service and then, if you choose,
you can become like her and get the things you are asking for. Those things are not given--they
are earned, and the cost of them is heavy. I don't really think you mean what you say, for
you haven't even wanted to go to school to learn to help. Perhaps the best way would be to
let you see _her_ in the way and then you can choose for yourself whether you want your gift.
Come and we will watch her climb the way."

This is an atom: 
So the Fairy of Helpful Service and the girl who wanted to be a leader went together into the
House of the Past.

This is an atom: 
"There," said the fairy, "there is Mrs. Fuller as a little girl. We will watch her grow and
you may see where she earned some of the qualities which you admire in her."

This is an atom: 
There she was, a mischievous little girl of ten, as happy as the day was long.

This is an atom: 
"Here she is laying the foundation for health," said the fairy, "with long hours of sleep and
good food and plenty of play. One begins away back in girlhood to be a leader. Some who would
have been good helpers for me cannot serve because they did not begin early enough to get ready."

This is an atom: 
Then as the little girl played there came into the way a black, black cloud. Gladys shuddered
as it came nearer and nearer to the little girl and finally enveloped her. It was death--the
death of her father, but after the cloud had passed and the sunshine had come again, the fairy
said,

This is an atom: 
"See, her shoulders are broader. She has learned what loneliness means."

This is an atom: 
On she went and then she was going to High School. Others had clothes that she did not have.
She must hurry to finish because there was no father in the home. So, eagerly she pushed through
the High School.

This is an atom: 
Just here Gladys saw a hand reached out to help and heard a voice saying to the girl, "Of course
it will be hard but you can go to college if you really want to go. It will do you good to
sacrifice for it." 'Twas the Master of the school who was helping her to keep in the way.

This is an atom: 
"Can you see her grow?" said the fairy. "She has added concentration, an appreciation of the
girl who has little and who must be with girls who have much, and now she has been given a vision."

This is an atom: 
Then Gladys watched her toil through college, earning her way, often overtired and worried
as to where the means to go on were to come from. But she pushed ahead.

This is an atom: 
"Oh," said Gladys, "how hard she works! I could never do that. I am sorry for her."

This is an atom: 
"You needn't be," said the fairy. "You need never be sorry for those that sacrifice for an
ideal. Be sorry for those who have none and so who live at ease." And they watched her struggle
through temptation and toil to the graduation day.

This is an atom: 
As the college days passed, there came strength of purpose, but there came also the desire
to serve. Gladys watched her lead the little group of dirty street boys in the slums.

This is an atom: 
"How can she do it?" said Gladys. "They are so dirty and so rough."

This is an atom: 
But the fairy said, "When one wants to serve, she looks at the heart and the life--not at the
clothes and the actions. The boys are helping her to keep in the way."

This is an atom: 
And after college there were happy days. Days of love and comradeship, days of work for the
fairy; days when opportunity was everywhere. And in these days of happiness there came lessons
of sharing, of winning, of filling the life with sunshine. The path was so bright that it dazzled.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly, Gladys looked ahead in the path. "Look," she said to the fairy. "Look, oh, how black
it is! Oh, I am sorry."

This is an atom: 
Then the storm descended and all was black in the way--oh, so black and to move took all of
one's strength. Against it she struggled, but it seemed as though she must surely be driven
from the path. Death and loneliness and worries seemed overpowering.

This is an atom: 
But the storm passed and, when once again there was peace, a great strength had come in its
place, for there was sympathy for others who suffered, there was an appreciation of the value
of friendship, and there was a knowledge that God helps.

This is an atom: 
Little by little the road widened, though often it was lonely and hard. There were many steep
places but each added something. And then Gladys saw the picture change.

This is an atom: 
There was Mrs. Fuller with her girls and she was leading them by the hand. But it was by no
means easy. Some held back; some chose to play by the way; some looked longingly at the things
by the wayside that would harm. But her one hand reached up and her other hand helped them
ahead as she tried to keep them in the way.

This is an atom: 
As the picture faded, Gladys turned to the fairy. "I thought it had been all sunshine but now
I see how hard it has been to learn to understand and to help. I love her better than I did
before, now that I have seen her in the way. Thank you, fairy."

This is an atom: 
"But wait," said the fairy. "You asked me for a gift. Do you still want it? Do you still want
to follow her?"

This is an atom: 
"To follow means study, and sacrifice, and temptations conquered, and sympathy, and all sorts
of hard things, doesn't it? I never thought about it. But I love Mrs. Fuller and I still want
to lead girls--I still want the letters and I still want to be like her. Please, Fairy of Good
Works, put me in the way and I will go back to school and begin to get ready."

This is an atom: 
Then the little lady smiled as she waved her wand over the head of the girl. "Your life may
be much more sunny than hers, dear. Not all must have the same things to overcome. But whatever
you meet in the way, you must struggle against it and come out stronger because you have struggled.
Can you see away off there in the distance the hands of girls--oh, so many of them--eagerly
reached out for help? They are 'your girls.' And here is the way. Above there is one who helps
and I am here though you may not see me. Push forward or the girls will have no helper. Good-by
and good luck to you."

This is an atom: 
But as Gladys reached out to detain her, her hat fell to the ground and she found herself sitting
against the tree. In her hand was the picture of Mrs. Fuller and her girls. Long she looked
at the picture. Then she said to herself,

This is an atom: 
"I never knew the way was so long or so hard to be like you but if just one girl can love me
some day as I love you, then I shall be glad I have walked in the way. I am ready to try and
I hope I can win."

This is an atom: 
AN OLD, OLD STORY

This is an atom: 
It was a dark and rainy day when about the inn-fire, close to the great caravan way that led
through Canaan, in the land of Palestine, a group of camel-drivers and travelers were gathered.
They looked very different from what they do to-day, for nearly four thousand years have passed
since then. But they were all huddled together listening to stories and songs.

This is an atom: 
In the group there were men from Egypt; there were men from Babylon, the great city far to
the East; there were men from the land of Canaan; and then there were some wandering nomads
who had lately come from the East and so were called by the Canaanites "Hebrews," which means,
"People from the Other Side." Most of these men were shepherds, but they loved to meet with
the camel-drivers and learn of the customs and habits of the people of other lands. 'Twas a
strange group of men sitting about the little fire.

This is an atom: 
In those days, as now, men loved to tell stories that had come down to them from their fathers
and grandfathers, and often they found that a story from Egypt was but little different from
one that had been told in Babylonia. So they loved to listen to the story-tellers.

This is an atom: 
But on this day it had rained and rained till the streams were full and the way was very hard
to go. Thus there were very many men in the inn. 'Twas the turn of the Babylonian, so he began,

This is an atom: 
"I will tell you one of the very oldest of our stories--about a great rain-storm.

This is an atom: 
"Years and years and years ago the Gods in heaven began to fear that
  the men of the earth were going to live forever and so they made a
  plan by which to destroy them. There should be a great rain for days
  and days and days, and all these men and women and children should be
  drowned. Then the Gods would be free from their worries.

This is an atom: 
"But one of the Gods named Ea had a friend who lived on the earth,
  and so he sent word to him to go with all his family into a big, big
  ship and take with him two of every kind of animals. Utnapishtim, the
  friend, did as he was told.

This is an atom: 
"Then the rain came and for six days and nights there was no let-up
  at all. Deeper and deeper it grew till the Gods in heaven grew afraid
  and cowered in the highest corner of heaven. By this time every
  living thing, except the ones in the big ship, was destroyed.

This is an atom: 
"But after six days, the rain ceased. Then the man sent out a dove,
  but it returned, for it could find no place to rest. Later he sent
  out a raven and it did not come back, so he knew the waters were
  going down. Then he made a great sacrifice to the Gods and they came,
  they saw the great destruction and they gloated over it, pleased that
  their plan had worked so well."

This is an atom: 
There was applause when he had finished from many of the group, but the Hebrews did not applaud.
They had been taught that there was one true God, not many Gods. They had been taught that
God was kind to all and not one that gloated over destruction of men. They were not pleased
with the story of the great flood.

This is an atom: 
Then there came nights out under the stars and they heard the stories of how the earth was
made; of how man came to be; of the meaning of many of the things that they saw all about them.
But in every story there were found Gods who were cruel, who were unkind, who quarreled and
fought. There were many, many Gods, but none was like unto their God.

This is an atom: 
As the old Hebrews listened to all these old, old stories from the countries about them which
were told so often, they shook their heads sadly and said,

This is an atom: 
"We have come into this country to live and bring up our children. But if they hear these stories,
they will believe some of them and forget the true God. They must have stories of their own
that show how great and mighty is the God of Israel. But what shall we do about these stories?
If we say the stories are false, they will laugh at us and say, 'Why, our people have known
these stories since long, long before there was a Hebrew on the earth. What our fathers have
told us as true is surely true.' And if we say to our children, 'You must not listen to these
stories,' they will be all the more eager to listen. What shall we do?"

This is an atom: 
Finally it was decided that the stories of the Egyptians and the Babylonians must be remade
so as to be fit for their children to hear and they must teach the beliefs of their own religion
in stories of their own.

This is an atom: 
So, many weeks later as the men were gathered out under the stars on a beautiful night, one
of the best of the Hebrew story-tellers said quietly,

This is an atom: 
"I have listened to stories about the making of the world from many of you but I think my story
is better than any you have told. Would you like to hear the story of how the God of Israel
made the world?"

This is an atom: 
"'Tis a Hebrew who is talking," said one. "I didn't know you people had any stories. Give it
to us. Then we can compare it with our own great stories."

This is an atom: 
And the Hebrew story-teller began:

This is an atom: 
"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And these
  are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were
  created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,

This is an atom: 
"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every
  herb of the field before it grew; for the Lord God had not caused it
  to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.

This is an atom: 
"But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face
  of the ground.

This is an atom: 
"And the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground, and
  breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a
  living soul.

This is an atom: 
"And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is
  pleasant to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the
  midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

This is an atom: 
"And the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to
  dress it and to keep it.

This is an atom: 
"And out of the ground the Lord God made every beast of the field and
  every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would
  call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was
  the name thereof."

This is an atom: 
There was silence when the story was finished. This God of whom the Hebrew was telling was
wise and mighty enough to make the world, yet he was thoughtful and kind. He allowed man to
be a helper. There was only one God. They liked the story so well that they began to tell it
also and soon the beautiful story was known all through the land of Canaan. Little by little
it drove out the other stories and became the most loved one.

This is an atom: 
And when the old Hebrews saw the power of the story that told of the _one_ great God rather
than the many false Gods, they just took many of the old stories and made them good and wholesome
for their own little children to hear.

This is an atom: 
So great were the stories that the old Hebrews told that you will find many of them living
still. You can read them in your own Bible in the book of Genesis.

This is an atom: 
Ever since that day years and years ago, men have been asking that same old question, "Who
made the world?" The greatest men of science and history have tried to answer it, but none
of them have found a more beautiful answer to the question than this one which the old sheik
told in the days of the long ago and which you will find in the second chapter of Genesis in
your Bible.

This is an atom: 
HIS DEBT

This is an atom: 
It was a hot, sultry day in that little town near the Western coast of Africa when Afa Bibo
came. He had had a long, long journey from his home among the Ntum people far to the south
of Efulen. So he, as well as the men who had brought him, was glad when they saw the rude little
hospital looming up at the end of the path.

This is an atom: 
Years and years before, when Afa Bibo was just a little baby, his mother and father, because
they were superstitious and ignorant, had deliberately infected the little one with yaws, one
of the most loathsome of African diseases. Little by little the disease had spread through
his system till now, a boy in his teens, he was gradually losing his sight. So they had brought
him to the white doctor who had done so much for boys and girls in the neighborhood, to see
if he could also help Afa Bibo.

This is an atom: 
It took only a glance at the one eye to know that the sight was gone forever. But there was
a chance that the other might be saved. Mui Recibieronnos well, i had dierronos quanto i dieronnos

This is an atom: 
Some were
to go out and teach; some were to carry Testaments and tracts written in Bulu to others; some
were to help about the mission station so that there might be a better place in which to teach
the ones who came. Some were to raise extra crops so they might have something to give to those
who went far out to teach. Every one could give something, even though it was very different
from what another gave.

This is an atom: 
As it neared the time for the service, the black people might be seen coming from all directions.
Some had walked five miles, some ten, and some even twenty. All had something to eat so that
they might stay to hear all the good news that could be given in a day. They filled the little
bare building which the boys of the school had builded for a church; they filled the window
spaces; then they filled the yard about the church. Oh! there were very many of them and all
were eager for the service to begin.

This is an atom: 
Holding the roof of the little church were large poles which had been painted white and on
these the pledges were to be made. So as the service began, many looked at the poles and thought
what a wonderful thing it was to be allowed to give of themselves to the God who had become
their own.

This is an atom: 
Soon the pledging began. First to go was the old chief who had given up his twenty wives that
he might become a Christian. He was old. What would he give? First he made a slanting line
and then he crossed it. Ah! that was ten days of service.

This is an atom: 
Then others were ready, and some gave ten days, some one or two weeks, and some could even
give a month. The lines covered one pole and then another as the people passed down the aisle
and out of the building.

This is an atom: 
Last of all came the boys of the school. How could they give? They were only boys. But they
could take of their play time till they had gained a day or more to give. One marked after
another and last of all it was the turn of Afa Bibo.

This is an atom: 
Very near to him stood the kind doctor who had made him free from the pain and able to see
the way as he came to the white pole. So he smiled one of his rare smiles as he passed him.
Then he made a slanting line and crossed it; another and crossed it. That was twenty days.
No boy had given as much as that. But he was making another--twenty-five days. And he crossed
the third. Then with his shoulders square and resolve in his face he went out with the rest.

This is an atom: 
As the missionaries sat before their home on the following day, they saw Afa Bibo coming across
the yard to them. Calling the doctor aside, he said,

This is an atom: 
"Doctor, I am not satisfied with what I pledged yesterday. I want to give more."

This is an atom: 
"But, Afa," said the doctor, "already you have pledged thirty days. That is a great deal for
a boy to give. A pledge to God from you must be as binding as His promise is to us. Work out
the thirty days and then come back and give Him more if you like."

This is an atom: 
"But I am not happy about it," said the boy, "I want to give more."

This is an atom: 
"I think you had better leave it just as it is, for I am sure you do not know how long thirty
days will be when you begin to give it all. Run along and do your lessons. I think you have
given much to God," said the Doctor.

This is an atom: 
Then Afa slowly came very near to the doctor. Looking up into his face, he pulled down the
lower lid of the good eye showing it to be white and free from all soreness and pain.

This is an atom: 
"Doctor," he said, "do you see that good eye? Well, God saved me that eye and I have more to
be thankful for than any one else in all that big churchful yesterday. I owe him more than
thirty days. Please, sir, I want to pay back a little of what I owe him. Let me make it thirty-five."

This is an atom: 
So together the doctor, who had given his life for God, and the little black boy, who was just
beginning to give, went to the church and put another black mark on the tall white pole. And
Afa Bibo went out to work his thirty-five days for God.

This is an atom: 
Were you to go among the Ntum people to-day, you would find there a man who is beloved by all
because he has loved to give of himself to his people. He has a kindly face and a loving heart.
It is Afa Bibo, the boy who is still eager to pay for his one good eye.

This is an atom: 
HOW KAGIGEGABO BECAME A BRAVE

This is an atom: 
Kagigegabo sat in front of the wigwam watching the fire slowly die out. Her heart was full
of bitterness. For days she had watched the Braves get ready for the long chase. They had painted
their faces; they had given their war cries; they had fasted and prayed.

This is an atom: 
And now they had gone and the camp seemed very still. Oh! how she had wanted to go! Why was
she born a girl when she did want to be a Brave! Girls could never do brave things--they had
to stay at home, and tend the fires, and hoe the garden. Everything a girl had to do, she hated.
Everything a boy had to do, she liked. Her name was Kagigegabo, which meant "One who stands
forever." That would be a great name for a Brave, but she could never do anything that was
worth while. She was only a girl.

This is an atom: 
Slowly she rose to bring the corn and grind it. There was little needed, for the Braves of
the wigwam had all gone--even Guka, her brother, had gone. Before this she had watched the
others go and then had had him to cheer her. Oh, dear! Why was she a girl?

This is an atom: 
Hearing a step behind her, she rose to find Wicostu, the oldest squaw of the tribe, waiting
to speak with her.

This is an atom: 
"I have heard your thought," she said. "You think that to be a girl is to be less than a Brave.
It is not so. It is not so. To be a squaw one must be very brave. We cannot go to hunt and
to kill, but it takes no less of courage to stay here and guard the tepees. It takes courage
to bear pain--it takes courage to be tired and not complain. You can be brave, Kagigegabo,
even though you must grow into a Mahala and sit by the fire. The courage is not in the war
paint and feathers--the courage is all in the heart."

This is an atom: 
Kagigegabo sat very still after Wicostu had left her. Over and over she said to herself those
last words of the old squaw--"The courage is all in the heart." Perhaps after all she could
be a Brave, such as Guka was trying to be.

This is an atom: 
Down toward the spring she ran to get the water for the meal when, suddenly, a hand reached
out of the bushes, and she was drawn into them. When she tried to scream, a heavy band was
placed over her mouth, and then her hands were tied, her eyes were bandaged and she felt herself
being thrown on a pony. Oh! how fast they went!--like the wind it seemed.

This is an atom: 
Who had taken her? Where was she going? What did they want? Frightened as she was, she still
was trying to think.

This is an atom: 
Then, like a flash, there came to her something that she had heard the old chief say when she
had been trying to get closer to the council fire the last night.

This is an atom: 
"We shall go by the hill trail, for Eagle's Claw will surely have spies about the camp. We
cannot get through the valley alive."

This is an atom: 
Perhaps she had been taken by the spies and was on her way to the enemy camp of Eagle's Claw.
Oh! What did they want? If only she were a Brave, perhaps she would know what to do. Then there
came to her the words of Wicostu:

This is an atom: 
"You can be brave. The courage is all in the heart." But to be brave when one did not know
what was going to happen--oh! that was hard.

This is an atom: 
When the bandage was taken from her eyes, she was in the center of a circle of old Braves.
Very fierce they looked as she glanced about the circle. Her knees shook till it seemed she
must fall. Then she made a low bow to the chief and pointed to her feet--a sign that she was
ready to be his slave.

This is an atom: 
"Do you see that knife?" he screamed at her. "You shall die unless you tell us by what path
and to what place your Braves went to-day. Speak!"

This is an atom: 
What should she do? If she told, the men would die. If she kept silence, she must die. Her
hands trembled. Then she remembered again the words of Wicostu, "Courage is all in the heart,"
and smiling at the chief she said:

This is an atom: 
"Kagigegabo will lead you. She knows not the name, but the way."

This is an atom: 
For a long time they counseled. Should they go? At last five of the Braves were ready. They
mounted her on a pony. Then they came to her with a great bow and some poisoned arrows and said:

This is an atom: 
"If you try to escape, these are for you. If you lead us wrong, these are for you. If you lead
us right, you shall have this young Brave," and they led forth one of the strong, young Braves
of the tribe. "Go."

This is an atom: 
Out of the encampment went the six horses. Where should she go? She must lead in the way of
the hill. But how could she? Once she climbed a tree to get a look out and so gained a little
time. Once she led them where the rock dropped sheer and bare, and again she gained time. But
nearer and nearer to the meeting place she came.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly low at her feet she saw a tiny, white flower. It was the one used by her mother to
make the sweet drink that would make one sleep, and sleep, and sleep. But if too much was taken,
it meant death. A daring plan came to her mind. Dare she do it? Dare she eat of it? Mother
brewed it--she must eat it as it was. They were still several hours from where she knew her
father was to be found. If her plan succeeded, she could save him.

This is an atom: 
Reaching down, she dug her feet into the sides of the little pony. Immediately his heels went
high in the air and she lay flat on the ground.

This is an atom: 
Quickly she gathered much of the little white flower and pushed it into her dress. Then when
the men came, she was lying with broken ankle on the ground. The pain was intense, but the
happiness that they must stop was sweet to the girl. Over and over and over she said to herself,
"Courage is all in the heart. I can be a Brave."

This is an atom: 
She took some of the little white flower and began to eat of it.

This is an atom: 
"What is it?" said the men. "What do you eat?"

This is an atom: 
"I eat the sweet flower of this little plant. If you eat of this, you shall not thirst," said
the girl.

This is an atom: 
Now they had ridden far and hard and the day was very warm, so when the men heard this, they
bent and gathered bits of the plant. It was sweet and pleasing to the taste, so they ate more
and more of it. And the Indian girl watched them and smiled when none could see.

This is an atom: 
It was decided to get the evening meal while the oldest chief bound the ankle of the girl.
So they hurriedly cooked it. But before it was ready, the leader leaned against the old tree
and he was asleep. Then another and another slept. Stronger than opium had been the flower
that they had eaten.

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
Kagigegabo watched them while her own eyes began to droop. She must not go to sleep. Oh! what
could she do? She must ride when they were asleep. What could she do? She turned and twisted
the broken ankle. That helped a bit, for the pain was intense. She pulled great locks of her
hair and tied them about her fingers so that the blood would have to force its way about. And
after what seemed to her to be hours, she was still awake and the five men were all sleeping.

This is an atom: 
Slowly, very slowly, she pulled herself away from the fire out into the bush where her pony
was tied. Her feet seemed determined not to move and she wanted so much to lie down and sleep.
But she kept on till she had led the pony away from the group. Then she mounted and started
on her ride.

This is an atom: 
But it was no use. She could not stay awake. Now what was she to do? They were on the direct
road to the valley. For a moment she hesitated. Then quickly she tore her dress in strips.
Taking a sharp stone, she cut her arm and with the blood she made two pictures on a piece of
wood--the one showed five Indians asleep--the other showed an Indian girl by the road. Taking
the strips from her dress, she fastened the bit of wood to the saddle.

This is an atom: 
She took from her arm the circle of brass which would tell her father from whom the message
had come, and fastened it to the saddle. Then a cut of the whip across the legs sent the pony
flying down the path.

This is an atom: 
After he had gone, the girl sat in a dazed way near the path. She was so tired. If only they
would hurry, then she could tell them which way to go--but sleep came before the pony had gone
even one mile.

This is an atom: 
Five days later, Kagigegabo opened her eyes slowly and looked about. She was lying on the skins
in the wigwam of her mother. Her ankle was tightly bound and she felt very stiff and sore.
Across her wrist there was an ugly cut. No one was about so she lay there trying to remember
what had happened. How long had she been there and where was her mother?

This is an atom: 
A step sounded outside and an old war chief--her father--looked anxiously into the tent. When
he saw her eyes open, he came slowly in and gazed long at the Indian girl on the bed and then
went as slowly out again.

This is an atom: 
When he came back, there were with him five other chiefs. Around the bed they stood in a silent
circle and Kagigegabo wondered what they were going to do with her. Had she done wrong? Was
she to be punished?

This is an atom: 
But the old chief spoke:

This is an atom: 
"Kagigegabo, you have saved the tribe from ruin, and because of your help, we have captured
the enemy, for whom we were searching. They have told us of your bravery and of your wisdom.
You were more full of courage than any squaw we have ever known. You shall no longer be called
Kagigegabo, but you shall be called Aotonaka, the daring one."

This is an atom: 
Then upon the arm of the girl who had wished she could be a Brave they bound a red band--the
red band of courage.

This is an atom: 
THE WHITE FLOWER OF HAPPINESS

This is an atom: 
By Persis Richardson

This is an atom: 
The King sat in the library of the palace reading an old, old book--a book written when the
King's great-great-grandfather sat on the throne. The King had never seen the book before and
it was very interesting to him. For the book told of a strange little plant that had grown
in the kingdom in those days of the old, old king.

This is an atom: 
No matter how hard the people had to work, if the little plant was growing in their homes,
they were happy. Indeed, the book said that the flower of the plant was so beautiful that no
garden was complete without it; so in the days of the long ago, it grew in the gardens of the
rich and the poor, while happiness and prosperity reigned in the land.

This is an atom: 
Eagerly the king read the description of the little flower that grew on this wonderful plant.
It was white as the driven snow. It had heart-shaped petals surrounding a wonderful heart of
gold, and it was known as the White Flower of Happiness.

This is an atom: 
Now the King loved flowers dearly and there were many in his garden; but he was sure he had
never seen this little flower. So, because he wanted to have one for his very own and especially
because he wanted happiness and prosperity for his people, he determined to find it.

This is an atom: 
"Surely somewhere in the kingdom there must be a plant left if it grew so common in the days
of my great-great-grandfather," said the King.

This is an atom: 
Then calling the heralds to him he said:

This is an atom: 
"Ride forth and search. Go East, and West, and North, and South, and say to my people, 'Search
for the White Flower of Happiness, and when you have found it, bring it to me that I may raise
more seeds so that all may have a chance to own it. 'Tis a little flower, white as the driven
snow, with petals that are heart-shaped around a heart of gold.'"

This is an atom: 
Eagerly the people, both rich and poor, went to work, for they knew of the wondrous beauty
of the flower and wished it for their own.

This is an atom: 
Now there were two people who were very sure they would be first to find the flower. One was
a rich woman who loved beautiful things. Her home was the largest of any on the finest street
in the royal city. She had many and large gardens, cared for by the best gardeners to be found.
Yet in the summer-time, when they were glowing with hundreds of flowers, few there were who
could enjoy them. A high hedge surrounded them all and only her friends were permitted to go
through the iron entrance gate.

This is an atom: 
This wealthy woman said to herself: "I will find the flower and it will be easy to keep it
secret from all others if I have it here behind the hedge. Then I shall be sure of happiness
in the future."

This is an atom: 
So all of her gardeners were set to work to search for the White Flower of Happiness. Wherever
they found a plant of rare beauty, they bought it hoping that it might be the plant she sought.
Seeds of all kinds also were planted. And in the blossoming time there were flowers in the
gardens by the thousands--but behind that great wall there was no flower that was white as
the driven snow, with heart-shaped petals surrounding a heart of gold.

This is an atom: 
There was also a man in the kingdom who thought he could surely find the flower. He was a business
man.

This is an atom: 
"If I could find it," he said, "I would grow more plants and sell them to the people at a great
profit. Then I should quickly grow rich and there would be no need for me to work."

This is an atom: 
So he set his office force all to work to write letters to the gardeners and seed-growers of
the world. They described the little flower and offered large sums for one single plant. But
he, too, failed in his search. It was not to be found.

This is an atom: 
Down in the heart of the poorer section of the royal city there lived a little old lady whom
every one called Aunt Betsy. She was very poor; she had only one room that she could call home,
and her only companion was a scrawny cat that every one else had driven away. But it loved
her and she loved it, and was glad to have it share her home.

This is an atom: 
She was very lame and had to hobble away to her work every morning, yet she was the cheeriest
little body alive and every one loved her.

This is an atom: 
Aunt Betsy, like all of her neighbors, was seeking the White Flower of Happiness.

This is an atom: 
"This old street with its tumble-down houses, and uneven sidewalks, and tin cans surely needs
a heap of something to cheer it," she would say. "Now, if I could find just one plant, I would
make this old alley the finest place ever. Then the little children here could have some chance.
I wish I might find it."

This is an atom: 
But no flowers grew where she lived or where she worked, so she couldn't hope to find the plant.
The only thing she could do was to save every penny she could so that, if the King found the
plant, she might possibly buy a seed.

This is an atom: 
Into an old tin cup she put the pennies, one by one, but it was very slow work, for Aunt Betsy
was very poor.

This is an atom: 
One winter night as Aunt Betsy returned from work, she found a queer looking bundle on her
door-step and, on unrolling it, she found Bobby, one of the neighbor's children. Now Bobby
had no mother and only a poor drunken father, who often beat him. And Aunt Betsy saw, as she
unrolled him, that his face was all tear-stained, so she knew what had been happening. Bobby
had crept away from the blows to come to his best friend when in trouble--Aunt Betsy.

This is an atom: 
Carefully she picked the little fellow up, carried him into her bare little room, gave him
a hot drink, and then tucked him all comfortably on the couch which served as her bed. Tired
from his day of play and work, the little fellow was soon lost in sleep.

This is an atom: 
Not so Aunt Betsy. Sitting by the fire, all she could see were the great holes in the shoes
she was drying. Bobby needed some shoes very badly, but she had no money with which to buy some.

This is an atom: 
"There is the money in the cup," said a voice within.

This is an atom: 
"But I couldn't give that, for I want so much to buy a seed to bring happiness to this alley,"
thought Aunt Betsy.

This is an atom: 
"But a pair of shoes would bring happiness to Bobbie now," said the voice.

This is an atom: 
She looked again at the little swollen feet under the cover on the couch. Then slowly, yet
with a smile of infinite tenderness, she softly stole to the cupboard, took the money from
the little tin cup, drew on her old shawl, and went out into the night.

This is an atom: 
'Twas a very happy Bobbie who went back to his home in the morning, and behind Aunt Betsy's
stove were the little worn shoes. A little later a little old woman went down the narrow stairs
to her work and she sang as she went.

This is an atom: 
That night Aunt Betsy, hurrying past a florist's shop, bumped into a barrel of waste that stood
on the walk. Stopping abruptly, she saw a wilted-looking plant in an old broken pot on the
top of the pile.

This is an atom: 
"Why, you poor little plant," said Aunt Betsy. "I'll just take you home and love you; perhaps
you will grow for me in my little upper room."

This is an atom: 
So she carried it home, transplanted it into the old tin cup from which she had taken the money,
and then set it where the sunshine would find it the very first thing in the morning.

This is an atom: 
In two days the plant showed signs of life. In a week it stood tall and firm. In two weeks
there was a bud which Aunt Betsy watched with great care. Would it be pink or red or yellow?
She didn't care if only it were a blossom.

This is an atom: 
'Twas night when she came home from her work, but as soon as she opened the door she knew that
the little flower had opened, for the room was full of the fragrance that it was sending forth.
She hurried to the window and she saw--oh, could she believe her eyes! She saw a little flower,
white as the driven snow. Its petals were heart-shaped and surrounded a heart of wonderful
gold. It was the White Flower of Happiness.

This is an atom: 
During the night, the little plant stayed with her in the attic room, but in the morning she
carried it to the palace and gave it to the King. Thus, through a simple loving old woman,
the White Flower of Happiness was given to a whole kingdom.

This is an atom: 
But the strange thing about the plant was this: Whenever its owner kept the flower only for
self and did not share it with others, it withered and died; but, when lovingly shared, it
grew and blossomed and made happy, not only its owner, but all to whom it went. It was in very
truth to all--The White Flower of Happiness.

This is an atom: 
THE SPEAKING PICTURE

This is an atom: 
There had been a great discussion in the High School all the week, and as Friday drew nearer
the excitement grew more and more intense. For Barton High School had many girls from the Hill
section of the town where the mill owners lived, and also many girls from the River section
where the mill workers lived.

This is an atom: 
There was to be an election for the president of the Senior Class and when the names of the
candidates for the presidency had been posted on the bulletin board by the nominating committee,
a mill girl headed the list.

This is an atom: 
Such a thing had never been heard of in the school. Always the president of the class had been
the one who could entertain the class, who could stand out prominently during class week, whose
father would help to pay the bills of the Commencement time.

This is an atom: 
But at the beginning of the year, the class had decided to learn to do things according to
parliamentary law and to be democratic, and this was the result. Never for a moment had the
girls and boys of the Hill section dreamed that a committee would dare to choose a River-section
president.

This is an atom: 
To be sure, the girl whom they had chosen had led the class both in marks and in the debating
club. Yes, she could make a splendid Commencement Day speaker, but she was a River-section
girl, and they just wouldn't have it.

This is an atom: 
So they argued and pleaded and tried to persuade their friends to make her fail the election.
Why, there would be no fun at all during Commencement week if she led the class. She had nothing
at all to spend for fun.

This is an atom: 
Chief among the objectors had been Mary Waite. Her father owned the largest mill and she had
thought surely the place was to be hers. She had even planned how she would entertain the class
on the lawn of her home. She was ready to do almost anything to upset the plans of the nominating
committee.

This is an atom: 
So the group of girls were still scolding when they reached the door of the museum about four
o'clock on Thursday afternoon. I replied that this was not done because the boat was caught
in the Sea mui, i wanted to take him on earth, i that if I wanted
to follow, that that would take my boat oars, i work, force because
of Brac is taking Havi Earth: vn i advised him that a master who
took it, it was called Pantoja, telling that if one day the Earth
did not, that does not take another six, this i time needed to die
of hunger.

This is an atom: 
I view their will, take my Remo, so i did all that on my ship for
this, i nearly bogamos since the Sun: but as the Governor had the
most healthy, i reece People, that all Havi in podimos no way you
follow, or hold her.

This is an atom: 
It was at the end of the gallery, and a wonderful
light was thrown on it from a globe just above the picture. The Christ was standing in a room
and in his face was such a tender, thoughtful look.

This is an atom: 
Mary sat down in the seat nearest to her. She did not want to move nearer lest she lose the
rare expression of the face of the Christ. It had only been a few weeks since she had been
standing before the altar of the church, making herself a gift to the Christ. So as she sat
and watched the picture, she thought to herself:

This is an atom: 
"What a wonderful man he was! I should have loved to have had him look in my face as he is
looking into theirs. I wish I might have really seen him."

This is an atom: 
After a time she moved nearer. Then she could see the faces of the other persons in the picture.
From where she had been sitting, only the face of the Christ had seemed to stand out, though
one knew the others were there. They were sitting about the table in a home.

This is an atom: 
What a rude table it was! How roughly they were dressed! Why, they were only poor people, yet
the Christ was standing in their midst, giving them to eat.

This is an atom: 
She studied his face. How beautiful it was! How much she loved him! How eager she was to give
him her very best! What could she do to show her love? And as she looked she heard a voice
saying to her: "The poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not always."

This is an atom: 
Then somehow the faces of the men in the picture seemed like those of the men who worked in
her father's mill and in the face of the woman she saw a likeness to Elizabeth Meeker. But
the face of the Christ was still full of love and tenderness.

This is an atom: 
The head of the girl drooped as she sat long before the picture. What had she against Elizabeth
Meeker? Nothing except the fact that she was poor. She was a girl that Jesus would have loved,
for she was always dependable. Yet Mary was trying to take away the greatest pleasure that
might ever come to that poor girl.

This is an atom: 
She had no pretty home, she had little time for play; she hadn't even a mother. Yet Mary knew
she had been very, very unkind to her.

This is an atom: 
And now the face of the Christ seemed searching her very soul: "The poor ye have always with
you, but me ye have not always. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these,
ye have done it unto me."

This is an atom: 
There was a sound of a bell and Mary knew she must leave the room. One last look she gave to
the Christ of the picture. Then she smiled and nodded her head.

This is an atom: 
When she came to join the girls below, she said quietly:

This is an atom: 
"Girls, let's give the school a surprise to-morrow. Let's go and vote for Elizabeth Meeker,
since so many of the class want her for president, and then prove to the rest that we can still
have a good time during Commencement week. Father will let us use the grounds when we like
and we can all have a part in the planning of the fun. I should just like to see if she really
can make a class president as well as we girls from the Hill."

This is an atom: 
And though the girls couldn't understand why she had changed, yet they were glad to follow
her lead.

This is an atom: 
That night Mary Waite sat before her desk in her pretty room on the Hill and looked again at
the assignment which had been given to her--

This is an atom: 
"Study the pictures in Gallery Nine and bring to me the name of the picture and the artist
who painted the one that speaks most plainly to you."

This is an atom: 
And in no uncertain letters she wrote:

This is an atom: 
Christ in the Home of the Lowly.
                             By L'Hermitte

This is an atom: 
Mary Waite.

This is an atom: 
THE QUEST

This is an atom: 
Once there came to the land of the Every-day a messenger from the King. In his hand he carried
glasses to help him in the search which he was making. Under his arm he was carrying a scroll.
On his face there was a look of deep concern.

This is an atom: 
How could he ever find the most beautiful thing in all the world? There were so many beautiful
things that he had no idea even where to begin. Yet this was his commission: "Of all the beautiful
things, choose for me the most beautiful."

This is an atom: 
So the messenger called for heralds and sent them forth to ask of the people of the Every-day
their help in choosing for the King.

This is an atom: 
"Bring to me your most beautiful thing," he said. "Then I will choose from these things what
I deem most beautiful."

This is an atom: 
And one brought a wonderful gem. It was clear as crystal; it sparkled in the light and seemed
to beg to be chosen. The rays of the noonday sun shone through the stone and all the people
cried with one voice:

This is an atom: 
"How beautiful! How wonderful! We have never seen the like!"

This is an atom: 
"Surely," thought the messenger, "I shall never find anything so rare as this. I will take
it to the King."

This is an atom: 
But a voice cried: "Wait, oh, messenger, wait! That which is dead can never be the most beautiful
thing. Surely I have here that which far exceeds the stone which you have seen. I beg you look
at this."

This is an atom: 
Then he opened the cover of the great box that he carried.

This is an atom: 
In a bed of shimmering white there lay a beautiful rose. Its leaves were still wet with the
dew of the garden. Its petals were as perfect as perfect could be. Then as the sun shone into
the box, the exquisite rose caught also the rays of the sun and slowly the beautiful petals
began to unfold.

This is an atom: 
There was silence in the group of people about the box. What a wonderful thing the man had
brought to the messenger! It is well-prepared people to wonder, skinny mui, mui large force
of i, i ligereça.

This is an atom: 
Los Arcos vsan that are thick as BRAC, eleven or twelve spans long, arrow two hundred steps,
with such a great touch, anything that IERRE.Quietly his
owner brought him forward, saying: "This is to me far more beautiful than the rose. This has
beauty and life, but it has also usefulness. It has saved the lives of many."

This is an atom: 
And he patted the head of the faithful animal.

This is an atom: 
Then a mother pressed through the crowd and said: "Surely no animal is so beautiful as a child.
See! here is my little one. She has beauty and life and usefulness--and she has also the magic
beauty of innocence. See her hands, and her little feet, and her golden curls. I am sure there
is no more beautiful thing in all the world than my baby."

This is an atom: 
Then the messenger sighed. What could he do? He just could not find the thing that the King
had asked him to find. All were so beautiful. Thinking to be by himself, he walked away. Into
a path alone by himself he went.

This is an atom: 
Then he heard voices, and, brushing aside the branches, he saw a young maiden who played with
a little child. Her touch was very tender as she played the childish game. And when they had
finished, the messenger held his breath, for the child had thrown a tiny arm about her neck
and the yellow curls of the baby were close to the brown ones of the maiden. And the maiden's
face was wreathed in a wondrous smile.

This is an atom: 
"That is beauty," said the messenger. "That is rare beauty. But why is she so beautiful? I
must see."

This is an atom: 
Quickly he unfastened the glasses from their case and turned them to the picture before him.
Then, because they were magic glasses used only by the King, he could see why she was beautiful.

This is an atom: 
In her mind he found clean thoughts; in her life he found kind deeds; in her soul he found
a high ideal; in her heart he found a mother-love for little children.

This is an atom: 
Then the messenger took from his arm the scroll which he carried and with his stylus he wrote
these words:

This is an atom: 
"In all the world I find no more beautiful thing than a maiden who is reaching toward life's
highest goal--a noble womanhood--with love to show her the way."

This is an atom: 
THE TREASURE

This is an atom: 
Four girls they were--four laughing girls from the High School. For three happy years they
had studied together and played together. But now Ambition had whispered to them. To each the
message had been the same:

This is an atom: 
"Hidden in the way that is ahead you will find a treasure. It is of all treasures most valuable.
It will bring to you comfort and happiness all the days of your life. Seek and ye shall find."

This is an atom: 
And at once they began to wish to find the treasure. Not to each other even did they tell the
secret that Ambition had whispered, for then another might find the treasure. Each in her own
way began to seek, and for a time their paths still led in the same direction.

This is an atom: 
But one bright, beautiful day they came to a place where the ways parted. Many roads led from
the one road and on every road there were many people. Now what should be done? In which way
was the treasure to be found? If one chose the wrong way, one might never find it.

This is an atom: 
There was little time to stand and think, for the crowds pressed on behind, always urging them
forward. Into one they must go at once.

This is an atom: 
"Surely this is the road," said the first, looking down a beautiful, long roadway. "One would
certainly find something worth while in such a beautiful place as this. Here are lights and
music; here are songs and merriment; here are people who seem as happy as the day. I shall
enter here, and after I have danced and played with the brightly dressed girls whom I see,
I shall hunt diligently for the treasure."

This is an atom: 
So she entered the way of Pleasure and, because there was time for naught else but play, her
days passed and she found it not.

This is an atom: 
"That road does not appeal to me," said the second. "The red of the lights, the noise of the
music, the laughter of the people seem annoying to me. I do not care to go with you longer.
I like this yellow way. There must be a great sun to light the way, for it is so beautiful.
Here, too, every one is searching, so I am sure they must have knowledge that the treasure
is here. I will enter and find it."

This is an atom: 
Then she, too, entered the way of her choice and it was the way of Gold. All about her were
traces of treasure, but there were many who pushed her aside. She grew weary with her search;
she liked little the people who were her companions in the way, and she found there no treasure
that brought comfort and happiness all her days.

This is an atom: 
"I like little those long, uninteresting roadways where it all is glitter and noise," said
the third. "I like little the great crowds of people. I shall take this hilly road where few
are working. They seem eager to reach the top. Now all treasure is hidden in the hillsides.
I shall climb here and search."

This is an atom: 
So she entered the way of Fame. It was very steep; at first it seemed that she could find no
place to put even one foot. She must cling to very uncertain bits along the way to help her
to move up, yet little by little she climbed. It took years and years, and one by one her companions
dropped by the way. Those who also neared the top had little of companionship for her. They
envied her her footholds; they tried to get ahead of her in the way. Then she knew that she
could never find the Great Treasure, for she was lonely, and a lonely heart is never satisfied
and happy.

This is an atom: 
"Which shall I choose?" said the fourth girl, looking all about her. "I think I shall try this"--but
just then a voice said: "I am tired and ill. Will you help me a bit in my way?"

This is an atom: 
'Twas an old, old man. His clothes showed signs of travel and his face was very sad. Taking
his hand, she led him for a time till he came to a resting place.

This is an atom: 
Then she was about to go back and choose her road, but a child's voice said: "Won't you help
me up this hill? I fall back when I try to climb." And she went still farther into the way.

This is an atom: 
And then, when the child had been given over to his mother, a boy needed help in carrying a
load, and as she talked with him she forgot the other road and began to see the beautiful things
ahead in the road over which she was traveling.

This is an atom: 
There were flowers to pick and give to the sad; there were cooling springs where one could
find cups of water for the weary; there were resting places under the trees to which one could
lead the aged. And she had forgotten that she came to seek for a treasure for herself in her
happiness in helping others.

This is an atom: 
So the days passed, filled to the brim with loving, helping deeds. The music which she heard
was the song of the birds; the beautiful colors to cheer came in the flowers and in the sunset;
the hills in the way were easily climbed, for there was much of friendship as she toiled upward.

This is an atom: 
One day in her path she saw a bent old lady in whose one hand was a book and in whose other
hand was a basket. She seemed heavily loaded and the girl hastened to help her.

This is an atom: 
"Let me carry your basket," she said cheerily. "Put the book on the top and I can take them both."

This is an atom: 
Then a smile came over the face of the woman as she said: "The basket seems to be heavy, for
in it is a great treasure. But he that hath this treasure finds no difficulty in carrying it.
It is yours, child--all yours. Let me read to you from the book."

This is an atom: 
Very slowly she opened the great book and read: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the
least of these, ye have done it unto me."

This is an atom: 
Then the gray cloak fell aside and her raiment was shining as the sun. Dixeron that by that way,
going to sea nine days, Havi vn Pueblo, they called Aute, i the
Indians he had a lot of corn, they had Frisoles i, i Calabaças i
Being so close to the Sea, reaching fish, they were friends i suios.

This is an atom: 
For you entered the way of Love to seek for your treasure
and where Love is, there God is also."

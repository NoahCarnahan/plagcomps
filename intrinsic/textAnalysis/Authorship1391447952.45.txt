This is an atom: 
ï»¿He erred: shall we count His gifts as naught?

This is an atom: 
The servant
may through his deafness err, And blind may be God's messenger; But the Errand is sure they
go upon,-- The word is spoken, the deed is done.

This is an atom: 
Was the Hebrew temple less fair and good That
Solomon bowed to gods of wood?

This is an atom: 
So in light and shadow the preacher went, God's erring and human
instrument; And the hearts of the people where he passed Swayed as the reeds sway in the blast,
Under the spell of a voice which took In its compass the flow of Siloa's brook, And the mystical
chime of the bells of gold On the ephod's hem of the priest of old,-- Now the roll of thunder,
and now the awe Of the trumpet heard in the Mount of Law.

This is an atom: 
The sailor reeling from
out the ships Whose masts stood thick in the river-slips Felt the jest and the curse die on
his lips.

This is an atom: 
Listened the fisherman rude and hard, The calker rough from the builder's yard; The
man of the market left his load, The teamster leaned on his bending goad, The maiden, and youth
beside her, felt Their hearts in a closer union melt, And saw the flowers of their love in
bloom Down the endless vistas of life to come.

This is an atom: 
Old age sat feebly brushing away From his ears
the scanty locks of gray; And careless boyhood, living the free Unconscious life of bird and
tree, Suddenly wakened to a sense Of sin and its guilty consequence.

This is an atom: 
It was as if an angel's
voice Called the listeners up for their final choice; As if a strong hand rent apart The veils
of sense from soul and heart, Showing in light ineffable The joys of heaven and woes of hell
All about in the misty air The hills seemed kneeling in silent prayer; The rustle of leaves,
the moaning sedge, The water's lap on its gravelled edge, The wailing pines, and, far and faint,
The wood-dove's note of sad complaint,-- To the solemn voice of the preacher lent An undertone
as of low lament; And the note of the sea from its sand coast, On the easterly wind, now heard,
now lost, Seemed the murmurous sound of the judgment host.

This is an atom: 
Yet wise men doubted, and good men wept, As that storm of passion above them swept, And, comet-like,
adding flame to flame, The priests of the new Evangel came,-- Davenport, flashing upon the
crowd, Charged like summer's electric cloud, Now holding the listener still as death With terrible
warnings under breath, Now shouting for joy, as if he viewed The vision of Heaven's beatitude!

This is an atom: 
Includes the unspeakable satisfaction to feel
the five fingers of a Christian tour and touching these wonders, you must also receive more,
with five cents a piece, are not paid the accounts of these seraphim
...With zeal wing-clipped and white-heat cool, Moved by the spirit in grooves
of rule, No longer harried, and cropped, and fleeced, Flogged by sheriff and cursed by priest,
But by wiser counsels left at ease To settle quietly on his lees, And, self-concentred, to
count as done The work which his fathers well begun, In silent protest of letting alone, The
Quaker kept the way of his own,-- A non-conductor among the wires, With coat of asbestos proof
to fires.

This is an atom: 
And quite unable to mend his pace To catch the falling manna of grace, He hugged
the closer his little store Of faith, and silently prayed for more.

This is an atom: 
And vague of creed and
barren of rite, But holding, as in his Master's sight, Act and thought to the inner light,
The round of his simple duties walked, And strove to live what the others talked.

This is an atom: 
And who shall marvel if evil went Step by step with the good intent, And with love and meekness,
side by side, Lust of the flesh and spiritual pride?-- That passionate longings and fancies
vain Set the heart on fire and crazed the brain?

This is an atom: 
That over the holy oracles Folly sported with
cap and bells?

This is an atom: 
That goodly women and learned men Marvelling told with tongue and pen How unweaned
children chirped like birds Texts of Scripture and solemn words, Like the infant seers of the
rocky glens In the Puy de Dome of wild Cevennes Or baby Lamas who pray and preach From Tartir
cradles in Buddha's speech?

This is an atom: 
In the war which Truth or Freedom wages With impious fraud and the wrong of ages, Hate and
malice and self-love mar The notes of triumph with painful jar, And the helping angels turn
aside Their sorrowing faces the shame to bide.

This is an atom: 
The heart must bleed before it feels, The pool be troubled before it heals; Ever by
losses the right must gain, Every good have its birth of pain; The active Virtues blush to
find The Vices wearing their badge behind, And Graces and Charities feel the fire Wherein the
sins of the age expire; The fiend still rends as of old he rent The tortured body from which
be went.

This is an atom: 
In the over-drift And flow of the Nile, with its annual gift, Who cares
for the Hadji's relics sunk?

This is an atom: 
The tide that loosens
the temple's stones, And scatters the sacred ibis-bones, Drives away from the valley-land That
Arab robber, the wandering sand, Moistens the fields that know no rain, Fringes the desert
with belts of grain, And bread to the sower brings again.

This is an atom: 
Initially it was for ill, but once
she asked William about which it was struck.

This is an atom: 
"I will none of those present his lecture," she
said, "because how do I listen and judge if my heart is torn apart?The husband and father whose children fled And sad wife wept when his drunken
tread Frightened peace from his roof-tree's shade, And a rock of offence his hearthstone made,
In a strength that was not his own began To rise from the brute's to the plane of man.

This is an atom: 
Old
friends embraced, long held apart By evil counsel and pride of heart; And penitence saw through
misty tears, In the bow of hope on its cloud of fears, The promise of Heaven's eternal years,--
The peace of God for the world's annoy,-- Beauty for ashes, and oil of joy Under the church
of Federal Street, Under the tread of its Sabbath feet, Walled about by its basement stones,
Lie the marvellous preacher's bones.

This is an atom: 
No saintly honors to them are shown, No sign nor miracle
have they known; But be who passes the ancient church Stops in the shade of its belfry-porch,
And ponders the wonderful life of him Who lies at rest in that charnel dim.

This is an atom: 
Long shall the
traveller strain his eye From the railroad car, as it plunges by, And the vanishing town behind
him search For the slender spire of the Whitefield Church; And feel for one moment the ghosts
of trade, And fashion, and folly, and pleasure laid, By the thought of that life of pure intent,
That voice of warning yet eloquent, Of one on the errands of angels sent.

This is an atom: 
And if where he labored
the flood of sin Like a tide from the harbor-bar sets in, And over a life of tune and sense
The church-spires lift their vain defence, As if to scatter the bolts of God With the points
of Calvin's thunder-rod,-- Still, as the gem of its civic crown, Precious beyond the world's
renown, His memory hallows the ancient town!

This is an atom: 
In the winter of 1675-76, the Eastern Indians, who had been making war upon the New Hampshire
settlements, were so reduced in numbers by fighting and famine that they agreed to a  peace
with Major Waldron at Dover, but the peace was broken in the fall of 1676.

This is an atom: 
He had taken up the  hatchet
to revenge the brutal treatment of his child by drunken white sailors, which caused its death.

This is an atom: 
It not unfrequently happened during the Border wars that young white children were adopted
by their Indian captors, and so kindly treated that they were unwilling to leave the free,
wild life of the woods; and in some instances they utterly refused to go back with their parents
to their old homes and civilization.

This is an atom: 
RAZE these long blocks of brick and stone, These huge mill-monsters overgrown; Blot out the
humbler piles as well, Where, moved like living shuttles, dwell The weaving genii of the bell;
Tear from the wild Cocheco's track The dams that hold its torrents back; And let the loud-rejoicing
fall Plunge, roaring, down its rocky wall; And let the Indian's paddle play On the unbridged
Piscataqua!

This is an atom: 
Wide over hill and valley spread Once more the forest, dusk and dread, With here
and there a clearing cut From the walled shadows round it shut; Each with its farm-house builded
rude, By English yeoman squared and hewed, And the grim, flankered block-house bound With bristling
palisades around.

This is an atom: 
So, haply shall before thine eyes The dusty veil of centuries rise, The old,
strange scenery overlay The tamer pictures of to-day, While, like the actors in a play, Pass
in their ancient guise along The figures of my border song What time beside Cocheco's flood
The white man and the red man stood, With words of peace and brotherhood; When passed the sacred
calumet From lip to lip with fire-draught wet, And, puffed in scorn, the peace-pipe's smoke
Through the gray beard of Waldron broke, And Squando's voice, in suppliant plea For mercy,
struck the haughty key Of one who held, in any fate, His native pride inviolate!

This is an atom: 
He who speaks has never lied.

This is an atom: 
Waldron of Piscataqua, Hear what
Squando has to say!

This is an atom: 
In his wigwam, still as stone,
Sits a woman all alone,

"Wampum beads and birchen strands Dropping from her careless hands, Listening ever for the
fleet Patter of a dead child's feet!

This is an atom: 
"When the moon a year ago Told the flowers the time to blow, In that lonely wigwam smiled Menewee,
our little child.

This is an atom: 
"Ere that moon grew thin and old, He was lying still and cold; Sent before us, weak and small,
When the Master did not call!

This is an atom: 
"On his little grave I lay; Three times went and came the day, Thrice above me blazed the noon,
Thrice upon me wept the moon.

This is an atom: 
"'All-uncalled, he dares not show Empty hands to Manito Better gifts he cannot bear Than the
scalps his slayers wear.

This is an atom: 
'

"All the while the totem sang, Lightning blazed and thunder rang; And a black cloud, reaching
high, Pulled the white moon from the sky.

This is an atom: 
"I, the medicine-man, whose ear All that spirits bear can hear,-- I, whose eyes are wide to
see All the things that are to be,--

"Well I knew the dreadful signs In the whispers of the pines, In the river roaring loud, In
the mutter of the cloud.

This is an atom: 
"At the breaking of the day, From the grave I passed away; Flowers bloomed round me, birds
sang glad, But my heart was hot and mad.

This is an atom: 
The theater was transformed, and
when they came to the distant place, was the spirit, and he suddenly
turned around and it came to him, Hamlet something to stand too close.

This is an atom: 
Squando speaks, who laughs at fear; Take the captives he has ta'en;
Let the land have peace again!

This is an atom: 
"

As the words died on his tongue, Wide apart his warriors swung; Parted, at the sign he gave,
Right and left, like Egypt's wave.

This is an atom: 
One alone, a little maid, Middleway her steps delayed, Glancing, with quick, troubled sight,
Round about from red to white.

This is an atom: 
"Gift or favor ask I none; What I have is all my own Never yet the birds have sung, Squando
hath a beggar's tongue.

This is an atom: 
'

"Yet for her who waits at home, For the dead who cannot come, Let the little Gold-hair be In
the place of Menewee!

This is an atom: 
Come to Saco's pines afar; Where the sad one waits at home, Wequashim,
my moonlight, come!

This is an atom: 
As God lives, from Satan's
hand I will pluck her as a brand!

This is an atom: 
Wequashim, my moonlight, say,
Wilt thou go with me, or stay?

This is an atom: 
Not a word the Indian spoke, But his wampum chain he broke, And the beaded wonder hung On that
neck so fair and young.

This is an atom: 
Silence-shod, as phantoms seem In the marches of a dream, Single-filed, the grim array Through
the pine-trees wound away.

This is an atom: 
Pride was in the mother's look, But her head she gravely shook, And with lips that fondly smiled
Feigned to chide her truant child.

This is an atom: 
Unabashed, the maid began "Up and down the brook I ran, Where, beneath the bank so steep, Lie
the spotted trout asleep.

This is an atom: 
"Where the hemlocks grew so dark That I stopped to look and hark, On a log, with feather-hat,
By the path, an Indian sat.

This is an atom: 
"Then I cried, and ran away; But he called, and bade me stay; And his voice was good and mild
As my mother's to her child.

This is an atom: 
"And he took my wampum chain, Looked and looked it o'er again; Gave me berries, and, beside,
On my neck a plaything tied.

This is an atom: 
"

Straight the mother stooped to see What the Indian's gift might be.

This is an atom: 
From the outward toil and din, From the griefs that
gnaw within, To the freedom of the woods Called the birds, and winds, and floods.

This is an atom: 
Watch thy flock, but blame not her, If her ear grew sharp to hear
All their voices whispering near.

This is an atom: 
Blame her not, as to her soul All the desert's glamour stole, That a tear for childhood's loss
Dropped upon the Indian's cross.

This is an atom: 
When, that night, the Book was read, And she bowed her widowed head, And a prayer for each
loved name Rose like incense from a flame,

With a hope the creeds forbid In her pitying bosom hid, To the listening ear of Heaven Lo!

This is an atom: 
THE pines were dark on Ramoth hill, Their song was soft and low; The blossoms in the sweet
May wind Were falling like the snow.

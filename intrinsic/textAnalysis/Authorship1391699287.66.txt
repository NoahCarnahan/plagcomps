This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
Then he told Lane of his encounter with Jabe.

This is an atom: 
"Now," continued he, "I'll tell you why I've been up into the woods
every afternoon with that sweater of rockweed. I made it into a tight
bundle and hung it on a springy limb to use for a punching-bag. It
wasn't very ornamental, but it served the purpose. I've been training
for this fight ever since the Fourth; had a feeling I'd get another
chance at him. It's over now, and I hope everybody's satisfied. I am, at
any rate."

This is an atom: 
"So that's the reason of your daily pilgrimages," laughed Lane. "You
certainly have been faithful enough to deserve to win. But what if you'd
never run across Jabe again? Wouldn't you have felt that you'd thrown
away your time?"

This is an atom: 
"Not a bit of it! That bout every afternoon has kept me in first-class
shape. But now the great event has come off, I'm going to break training
and give the rockweed a rest."

This is an atom: 
The _Barracouta_ was back at Tarpaulin before three o'clock. A remark
dropped by Budge roused the curiosity of the others, and Percy was
obliged once more to recount the story of his fight with Jabe.

This is an atom: 
"Well," said Jim, when he had finished, "they say a patient waiter is no
loser; but I guess it depends a good deal on how you spend your time
while you're waiting--eh, Perce?"

This is an atom: 
That night, after dark, when the boys were preparing to turn in, Filippo
stepped out to the fish-house for some kindling. He came back on the
run.

This is an atom: 
"_Fuoco!_" he panted.

This is an atom: 
The others trooped out hastily. On the southern horizon flamed a ruddy
light. Spurling gave a cry of alarm.

This is an atom: 
"Boys, it's a vessel on fire!"

This is an atom: 
XXI

This is an atom: 
OLD FRIENDS

This is an atom: 
Touched by the live wire of human sympathy, Camp Spurling came wide
awake in an instant. Out there, four miles to the south, men were
perhaps battling for their lives. Jim issued his orders like bullets.

This is an atom: 
"Come on, boys! We'll take the _Barracouta_. Fetch a five-gallon can of
gas from the fish-house, Perce! Budge and Throppy, launch that dory!"

This is an atom: 
Dashing into the cabin, he quickly reappeared.

This is an atom: 
"Thought I'd better get one of those first-aid packets! Somebody may be
burnt bad. Now, fellows! Lively!"

This is an atom: 
The dory was barely afloat when Percy came staggering down the beach
with the heavy can. Spurling swung it aboard, and all but Filippo jumped
in.

This is an atom: 
"Start your fire again!" shouted back Jim to the Italian. "Make some
coffee! And be sure to have plenty of hot water! We may need it."

This is an atom: 
Soon the sloop was under way and heading out of the cove.

This is an atom: 
"Lucky you thought of that fresh can of gas, Jim," said Budge. "The
tank's pretty near empty. We'd have been in a nice fix if the engine had
stopped about a mile south of the island."

This is an atom: 
"Take the tiller, Perce!" ordered Spurling.

This is an atom: 
Vaulting up out of the standing-room, he grasped the port shroud and
fastened his eyes on the fiercely blazing vessel. The flames had run up
her masts and rigging, and she stood out a lurid silhouette against the
black horizon. It was evident that she was doomed.

This is an atom: 
"She's gone!" was Jim's comment as he dropped back into the
standing-room. "Hope her crew got off all right. There isn't much we can
do to help; but at any rate we ought to go out and tow in her boats."

This is an atom: 
"What is she? Fisherman?" asked Throppy.

This is an atom: 
"Most likely! And not a very big one. Shouldn't wonder if she'd had a
gas explosion in her cabin; I've heard of a good many such cases. Hope
nobody's been burnt bad!"

This is an atom: 
There were a few minutes of silence as they gazed on the spectacle of
destruction. The _Barracouta_, driven to her utmost, steadily lessened
the distance. Brighter and larger grew the fire; every detail on the
fated craft stood sharply out against the pitchy background.

This is an atom: 
"Here come two boats!" exclaimed Lane.

This is an atom: 
Sure enough, they were clearly visible, more than two miles off, rising
and falling on the swell, their oars flashing in the light from the
conflagration. The crew had abandoned the hopeless fight and were saving
themselves.

This is an atom: 
"Keep her straight for 'em, Perce!" directed Jim.

This is an atom: 
Whittington obeyed. Soon the _Barracouta_ was within hailing distance of
the dories. In the now diminishing light from the distant fire the boys
could see that both were crowded with dark figures.

This is an atom: 
"Must be at least twenty-five aboard the two," commented Stevens.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," returned Spurling. "These fishermen carry big crews. Ahoy there!
What's the name of your vessel?"

This is an atom: 
"The _Clementine Briggs_, of Gloucester," replied a man in the bow of
the foremost dory. "Running in to Boothbay from Cashe's with a load of
herring. The gas exploded and set her on fire. We tried to put it out,
but it was no use. Just got clear with our lives and what we stood in."

This is an atom: 
"Anybody hurt?"

This is an atom: 
"Couple of men got their faces burnt, but not very bad. Lucky it was no
worse. But the old schooner's gone. Pretty tough on Captain Sykes, here,
for he owned most of her and didn't have much insurance. Fisherman's
luck!"

This is an atom: 
"Want a tow in to the island?"

This is an atom: 
"Sure!"

This is an atom: 
"Well, toss us your painter, and tell the other boat to make fast to
your stern."

This is an atom: 
In a very short time the _Barracouta_ was headed back for Tarpaulin,
with the two heavily loaded dories trailing behind her. Delayed by her
tow, she moved considerably slower than when coming out. A strange
silence hung over the two dories. For fishermen, their crews were
unusually quiet, sobered, evidently, by the catastrophe that had
overtaken their schooner.

This is an atom: 
"Wouldn't those men who were burnt like to come aboard the sloop?"
inquired Spurling. "Perhaps I can give 'em first aid."

This is an atom: 
"No," returned the spokesman. "One of 'em's Captain Sykes, here in this
dory with the handkerchief over his face. He isn't suffering much, but
his cheeks got scorched, so I'm talking for him. The other man is in the
next boat. The only thing for 'em to do is to grin and bear it; but just
now they're not grinning much, 'specially the captain."

This is an atom: 
Silence again. The sullen, red blaze on the distant vessel was dying
down against the horizon. The flames had stripped her to a skeleton. Her
hempen running rigging had been consumed; sails, gaffs, and booms lay
smoldering on her decks; above the hull only her masts and bowsprit were
outlined in fire against the blackness behind.

This is an atom: 
Lacking anything better to do, Jim began counting the men in the dories.
He made thirteen in each. Most of them sat like graven images, neither
speaking nor stirring. They had not even turned their heads to look at
the perishing schooner. He could not understand such indifference to the
fate of the craft that had been their home.

This is an atom: 
Sprowl's Cove was right ahead. Filippo opened the cabin door and stood
framed within it, the light behind him casting a cheery glow down the
beach. Louder and louder the bank behind the lagoon flung back the
staccato of the exhaust. Presently the sloop nosed into the haven, the
engine stopped, and Throppy went forward to gaff the mooring.

This is an atom: 
The dories were cast off and rowed to the beach. By the time the boys
got ashore all the men had landed. Jim, who had been watching them
quietly, noted that most of them disembarked clumsily, more like
landlubbers than sailors. They separated into two groups of very unequal
size. One, numbering six, including the men with handkerchiefs over
their burnt faces, withdrew from the others and began to talk in low
tones, with earnest, excited gestures. The remaining twenty clotted
loosely together, awkward and ill at ease, still preserving their
mysterious silence.

This is an atom: 
Before Jim had time to offer his unexpected guests anything to eat or
drink, Filippo bustled hospitably down the beach to the larger group.

This is an atom: 
"Will you have _caffè_? It is hot and _eccellente_."

This is an atom: 
They stared at him without replying. By the light from the open door Jim
could see that they were dressed like landsmen and that their clothes
did not fit well. Their faces were darkish, they had flat noses, and
their close-cropped hair was straight and black.

This is an atom: 
Before Filippo could repeat his question a man from the smaller group
hurried up and pushed himself abruptly between the silent score and
their questioner.

This is an atom: 
"No!" said he, brusquely. "We don't want anything. We had supper just
before the fire."

This is an atom: 
His tone and attitude forbade further questioning. Filippo, abashed by
the rebuff, returned rather shamefacedly to the cabin. The speaker
remained with the group, as if to protect them from further approaches.
To Jim his attitude seemed to be almost that of a guard. It deepened the
mystery that already hung about the party.

This is an atom: 
It was now past eight o'clock, and naturally some provision would soon
have to be made for passing the night. Jim pondered. Twenty-six guests
would prove a severe tax on their already cramped accommodations.
Still, the thing could be arranged; it must be. The smaller group of six
could be taken into the camp. Six of the silent twenty could be stowed
away aboard the sloop; while the remaining fourteen must make what shift
they could in the fish-house. Jim proposed this plan to the sentinel.

This is an atom: 
The man disapproved flatly.

This is an atom: 
"No!" was his decided reply. "We've got to get away to-night."

This is an atom: 
"To-night?" echoed Jim in amazement. "Why, man alive, you can't do that!
It's fifteen miles to Matinicus, and you're loaded so deep it'd take you
almost until morning to row there. And even if you made it all right,
you wouldn't gain anything, for the boat for Rockland doesn't leave
until the first of the afternoon. Besides, this wind's liable to blow up
a storm. Of course you could row ten miles north to Head Harbor on Isle
au Haut, walk up the island, and catch the morning boat for Stonington;
but you'd have to pull most of the way against the ebb, and when this
wind gets a little stronger it's going to be pretty choppy. _I_ wouldn't
want to risk it. Better stop with us to-night and let us make you as
comfortable as we can; and to-morrow you can start for any place you
please."

This is an atom: 
The man shook his head stubbornly.

This is an atom: 
"How far is it to the mainland?" he asked.

This is an atom: 
Jim could hardly believe his ears.

This is an atom: 
"The mainland!" he exclaimed. "A good twenty-five miles."

This is an atom: 
"Well, we've got to be there before morning."

This is an atom: 
"You're crazy, man! Twenty-five miles across these waters in the night,
with thirteen men in each dory! You'd never make it in the world. You
can't do it."

This is an atom: 
"Well, maybe we can't," retorted the other, impatiently, "but we're
going to. There's more ways to kill a cat than by choking her to death
with cream."

This is an atom: 
He walked back to the smaller group, and soon they were in heated, but
indistinct, argument. Jim noted that the men with handkerchiefs over
their faces seemed now to have no difficulty in bearing their share of
the conversation. Captain Sykes, in especial, was almost violent in his
gestures.

This is an atom: 
Presently they seemed to have reached an agreement. The spokesman walked
back to Jim and came directly to the point.

This is an atom: 
It was evoked, during the discussion, that the published despatch of Lord
Palmerston did not contain certain words used by the noble foreign
secretary, which gave to the ambassador a discretion as to the
propriety of making the communication dependent upon the tone of
public opinion in Spain, and the nature of events.

This is an atom: 
It was generally considered by the lords, that any indiscretion
which had taken place was at the embassy in Madrid, and not in the
Foreign-office.

This is an atom: 
The ambassador at the court of Madrid had been appointed by the Earl
of Aberdeen, whose management of the Foreign-office was in every direction
disastrous. The Peel foreign policy required men of a certain stamp,
whose agency little suited the policy or character of Lord
Palmerston's foreign-office administration.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Bankes withdrew his motion, and Mr. Urquhart was clamoured down in a
subsequent attempt to address the house upon the subject.

This is an atom: 
That gentleman seized every opportunity, in and out of the house,
to vituperate Lord Palmerston, and persisted in reiterating as
facts, fallacies which had been many times exposed.

This is an atom: 
The house and the country became utterly weary of his absurd
harangues, hence the extraordinary ebullition of feeling among
honourable members on that occasion.

This is an atom: 
CLOSE OF THE SESSION.

This is an atom: 
On the 30th of August, Mr. Disraeli reviewed the labours of the session
after the manner so effectively observed by Lord Lyndhurst in the other
house. The oration was ingenious, and eloquently amusing; it entertained
honourable members very much, but it neither instructed nor edified
the commons or the country.

This is an atom: 
Some curiosity was entertained as to how he would notice the measure
for removing Jewish disabilities; he declared that he "personally
approved of that measure, but condemned the policy of government
in bringing it forward without the hope of carrying it, for by that
means the cause lost ground."

This is an atom: 
This was mere pretence on the part of the honourable and rhetorical leader
of the opposition; he knew well that, assured of the support of
the commons, the government acted justly to the country and to those
aggrieved by bringing the measure through the lower house, and
throwing the responsibility of rejecting it upon the lords.

This is an atom: 
Besides, the election of Baron Rothschild for the city of London constrained
the government to adopt some course, and that which they chose was the
most dignified and constitutional. Mr.

This is an atom: 
Hume made some able strictures on the speech of "the reviewer of
the session," and Lord John Russell replied to it at length with
skill and dignity.

This is an atom: 
Nevertheless, the brilliant periods of "the oriental orator" had
their effect on both sides of the house; and Mr.

This is an atom: 
Disraeli was on the whole a more popular man, so far as admiration
of his genius was concerned.

This is an atom: 
Thus were the exclusion laws of the United States set at naught.

This is an atom: 
The destruction of the schooner had made it necessary for her passengers
to be landed somewhere as secretly and as quickly as possible. Twenty
men at three hundred dollars a head meant six thousand dollars. That
explained the anxiety of the six white men to reach the mainland that
night. They were criminals, breaking their country's laws for money.

This is an atom: 
Jim decided that they should never make use of the _Barracouta_.

This is an atom: 
The spokesman dropped his conciliatory mask and turned away defiantly.

This is an atom: 
"All right, young fellow! You've had your say; now we'll have ours."

This is an atom: 
"Throppy," said Jim in a low tone to Stevens, who was standing with Lane
beside him, "these men are smugglers. Call the cutter!"

This is an atom: 
He had time for nothing more. As Stevens slipped quietly back into the
cabin there was an angry outburst among the group on the beach.

This is an atom: 
"I've done my best, Cap," protested a voice. "He won't listen to reason.
Now take that rag off your face and handle this thing yourself. It's up
to you."

This is an atom: 
There was a sudden rush of enraged men toward Lane and Spurling. As they
came, two wrenched the handkerchiefs from their faces, revealing to the
astounded boys the features of the would-be sheep-thieves of the first
of the summer, Dolph and Captain Bart Brittler!

This is an atom: 
The latter was white with rage. His voice rose almost to a screech.

This is an atom: 
"No more fooling! We need that sloop and we're going to have her! Will
you sell her?"

This is an atom: 
"No."

This is an atom: 
"Then we'll take her!"

This is an atom: 
Brittler's hand shot into his pocket as if for a revolver.

This is an atom: 
"Stop there, Cap!" warned Dolph's voice. "No gun-play! 'Tisn't
necessary. We can handle 'em."

This is an atom: 
He flung himself suddenly on Spurling; another man leaped upon Lane.
Though taken completely by surprise and almost hurled backward, Jim
quickly recovered his balance. A sledge-hammer blow from Dolph's fist
grazed his jaw as he sprang aside. He returned it with interest, his
right going true to its mark; down went Dolph, as if hit by a
pile-driver. He lay for a moment, stunned.

This is an atom: 
Strong and active though Jim was, he could not bear the brunt of the
entire battle. Lane's assailant had proved too much for him; they were
struggling together on the gravel, the older man on top. Percy and
Filippo came running; but their aid counted for little. A stocky
smuggler turned toward them. A single blow from his fist sent the
Italian reeling. Percy lasted longer; but his skill was no match for the
brute strength of his foe. His lighter blows only stung his
antagonist to fiercer efforts. Little by little the boy's strength
failed and his breath came harder. He slipped on a smooth stone; with a
sudden rush his foe pinioned his arms and held him struggling.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: "WE NEED THAT SLOOP AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE HER!"]

This is an atom: 
Dolph recovered, staggered to his feet, and entered the fray again. It
was four to one against Jim; he fought manfully, but it was no use.
Presently he lay flat on his back on the gravel, bruised and panting,
one man kneeling on each arm, and a third on his chest.

This is an atom: 
"Take him up to the camp, boys!" puffed Brittler.

This is an atom: 
The doughty captain had not escaped unscathed. A swollen black eye and a
bleeding nose bore eloquent testimony to the force and accuracy of Jim's
blows. A guard on each side and another behind were soon propelling
Spurling toward the open door. From within came the ceaseless click of a
telegraph instrument. Throppy was still calling the cutter. Jim heard
the quick patter of the continental code; Brittler heard it, too, and
understood. He sprang forward with a shout of alarm.

This is an atom: 
"They've got a wireless! Smash it!"

This is an atom: 
A buffet on the side of the head knocked Stevens off his soap-box and
sent him rolling on the floor. Five seconds later a crashing blow from a
stick of firewood put the instrument out of commission. Brittler poised
his club threateningly over the prostrate Stevens.

This is an atom: 
"Wish I knew if you've been able to get a message through to anybody! If
I thought you had--"

This is an atom: 
He did not finish, but half-raised the stick, then dropped it again and
turned away. One by one the remaining members of Spurling & Company
were bundled unceremoniously into the cabin. Then the door was slammed
shut and two men with automatics were stationed on guard outside.

This is an atom: 
"Don't shoot unless you have to," instructed Brittler's voice, purposely
raised. "And remember a bullet in the leg'll stop a man just as quick as
one through the body."

This is an atom: 
And then in a tone lower, but perfectly audible to those inside:

This is an atom: 
"But don't stand any fooling! Stop 'em anyway! You know as well as I do
how much we've got at stake."

This is an atom: 
XXII

This is an atom: 
PERCY SCORES

This is an atom: 
Defeated and imprisoned in their own camp, the boys faced one another
dazedly. Though none of the five had suffered serious injury in the
scuffle, all were more or less bruised. Lane had a slight cut where the
back of his head had come in contact with a sharp stone on the beach;
and a swelling on Jim's right cheek told where the hard fist of one of
his assailants had landed.

This is an atom: 
Outside, the two guards conversed in low tones; but for a few minutes no
one spoke or moved in the cabin. The boys sat on the boxes or had thrown
themselves into their bunks. Elbow on table, chin resting in palm, Jim
was buried in thought. In a short time, he knew, Brittler and his gang
would sail away in the _Barracouta_. They would land their human cargo
and probably scuttle the sloop. Somehow they must be thwarted; but how?

This is an atom: 
The boys had no weapons to match those of their armed guard. Without
ammunition, the shot-gun was but a bar of iron. How could they cope with
the bullets in the automatics? Undoubtedly every smuggler carried a
revolver, and would use it in a pinch; possibly some might not wait
until the pinch came. It was a knotty problem. The drops oozed out on
Jim's forehead as he wrestled for its solution.

This is an atom: 
A low whistle fell on his ear. He glanced toward Percy's bunk and saw
the latter's hand raised in warning; he was taking off his shoes,
quickly and noiselessly. Why? Jim and the others watched.

This is an atom: 
Soon Percy stood in his stocking feet. He pulled out his knife and
opened the large blade. Stooping low, he stole toward the farther end of
the cabin. The window there was open and covered with mosquito netting.

This is an atom: 
Steps grated on the pebbles outside. One of the guards was making a
circuit of the camp. Percy flattened himself on the floor directly
beneath the window. The others, hardly daring to breathe, looked away.
The man paused for a moment; Jim knew that he was peering in. Apparently
satisfied that all was well, he resumed his patrol.

This is an atom: 
Without delay Percy rose. He drew his knife along the netting near the
sill, then cut it from top to bottom on each side, close to the frame.
So skilfully did the keen blade do its work that the screen hung
apparently undisturbed.

This is an atom: 
The guards began talking again. Placing one of the boxes silently under
the window, and stepping upon it, Percy slipped through the opening. His
light build enabled him to drop to the ground without making any noise.
The netting fell back and hung as before.

This is an atom: 
Outside, it was thick fog; a slight drizzle was beginning. It was
impossible to see further than a few feet. But the last two months had
familiarized Percy with every square yard of the beach, and he could
have found his way along it blindfold. Cat-footed, he stole down toward
the water.

This is an atom: 
Steps approached, voices; he halted, ready for a hasty retreat. But the
feet receded toward the cabin, and he had no difficulty in recognizing
the tones of Dolph and Brittler. The latter was in a bad humor.

This is an atom: 
"Now," he growled, "we've got a long way to go, and none too much time.
Every minute we waste here means just so much off the other end. Granted
we reach the mainland all right, we'll have to hustle to slip those
Chinks under cover before daylight. You'd better round 'em up in that
fish-house, so none of 'em'll stray away and keep us from starting the
second the sloop's ready. We've got to make sure there's plenty of gas
aboard, as well as a compass and chart. I'll see if I can scare up a
couple of lanterns."

This is an atom: 
The two separated, Dolph evidently going to look after the Chinese,
while Brittler kept on toward the cabin. Percy stood stock-still, his
heart thumping. Would the captain discover his absence?

This is an atom: 
"How's everything here, boys?" hailed Brittler.

This is an atom: 
"All quiet," replied one of the sentries.

This is an atom: 
"Come inside with me, Herb, so these fellows won't try any funny
business."

This is an atom: 
The door opened. Percy felt a thrill of fear. How could they fail to
notice there were only four prisoners in the camp?

This is an atom: 
But their captors evidently had not the least suspicion that he had
escaped. Probably they thought he was lying in one of the bunks. He
could hear the voices of Brittler and Jim, the one questioning, angry,
and menacing, the other tantalizingly deliberate as he grudgingly gave
the information demanded. Percy delayed no longer. He had his own work
to do, and it demanded all his energy.

This is an atom: 
Down he stole to the water's edge, then followed it west until he
reached a sloping rock. The _Barracouta_, he knew, was moored not fifty
feet out in the black fog.

This is an atom: 
Without hesitating a second Percy waded in, and soon was swimming
quietly toward the sloop. He had not dared to take one of the boats, for
fear the grating of her keel on the beach or the sound of her oars might
betray him. He cleft the water noiselessly, and it was not long before
he grasped the _Barracouta's_ bobstay and hoisted himself aboard.

This is an atom: 
Dropping down the companionway, he groped forward through the cabin to
the little door leading into the bow, and crept in on hands and knees.
His fingers found what he wanted, an opening between two planks, where a
leak had been freshly calked with oakum. He dug this out with his
knife-point, and the water began spurting in.

This is an atom: 
Backing out and closing the door, he found a wrench in the tool-box and
began fumbling about the engine. Soon the spark-plugs were unscrewed and
in his pocket.

This is an atom: 
"And there's a good job done!" he thought, triumphantly. "Guess that
gang of blacklegs won't get very far in the _Barracouta_ to-night!"

This is an atom: 
Voices on the shore. Dolph and Brittler were coming with a lantern; a
blur of light brightened through the fog.

This is an atom: 
"The compass and chart are aboard," came the captain's voice, "and this
can of gas'll be enough to make us sure of striking the mainland.
Launch that dory!"

This is an atom: 
The dip of oars and an increasing brightness told that the boat was
approaching. It would not do for Percy to be detected. Lowering himself
from the port bow into the water, he clung to the bobstay.

This is an atom: 
"They won't see me here!"

This is an atom: 
Bump! The dory struck the sloop and grated along her side. Dolph and
Brittler clambered aboard and descended into the cabin.

This is an atom: 
"Here's the chart!" exclaimed the captain. "And the compass, too! He
told the truth about them, at any rate."

This is an atom: 
"Lucky for him!" rejoined Dolph. "I don't like that big fellow worth a
cent."

This is an atom: 
"Good reason!" was the captain's rather sarcastic comment.

This is an atom: 
"You haven't any license to joke me about that knockdown, Bart Brittler!
I noticed you weren't in any hurry to mix it with him."

This is an atom: 
There was a moment of silence.

This is an atom: 
"What's that?" cried the captain, suddenly. "Sounds like water running
in! Hope the old scow isn't leaking. Let's have that lantern!"

This is an atom: 
Through the thin planking Percy could hear him open the little door and
crawl up into the bow. Then his faint, muffled voice reached the eagerly
listening boy.

This is an atom: 
"There's a bad leak here! Come in a minute!"

This is an atom: 
Into Percy's brain flashed a sudden idea that left him trembling with
excitement. Could he do it? If he tried, he must not fail. An instant
resolution set him dragging himself toward the stern.

This is an atom: 
Clutching the rim of the wash-board, he flung up one leg, caught his
toe, and raised himself, dripping. A moment later he was in the
standing-room.

This is an atom: 
He looked down into the cabin. The light of the lantern, shining round a
body that almost filled the little door to the bow, showed a pair of
legs backing out.

This is an atom: 
The die was cast. It was too late now for Percy to withdraw. His only
safety lay in action.

This is an atom: 
Like lightning he slammed and hooked the double doors of the
companionway, pulled the slide over, and snapped the padlock. Dolph and
Brittler were prisoners on board the _Barracouta!_

This is an atom: 
There was a moment of surprised silence. Then bedlam broke out below, a
confused, smothered shouting, a violent thumping on the closed doors and
slide. But Percy gave it no heed. Thus far his plan had succeeded, even
beyond his expectations. But his work was only begun. Before it should
be finished, four men on shore must be overcome.

This is an atom: 
Aquiver with excitement, he sprang into the dory and quickly rowed to
the beach, some distance from the camp. Then he leaped out with the oars
and carried them well up on the shingle.

This is an atom: 
The other dory of the smugglers was, he remembered, almost exactly in
front of the cabin. Skirting the water, he soon came plump upon the
boat. He felt inside, found the oars, and gave one after the other a
shove out into the cove. Barely had he done this when hurrying steps
approached. One of the guards from the camp was coming to investigate
the tumult on the _Barracouta_.

This is an atom: 
He passed so close to the dory beside which Percy was crouching that
the boy could almost have touched him. Luckily he had no lantern. Percy
hardly dared to breathe until the man was twenty feet past.

This is an atom: 
"What's the trouble out there?" he shouted.

This is an atom: 
If the two on the sloop heard him at all, they made no intelligible
reply. The tumult and thumping kept on. Not waiting to see whether or
not the sentinel would succeed in establishing communication with his
marooned companions, Percy ran silently up the beach. Making a broad
circuit, he approached the cabin from behind.

This is an atom: 
Through the open window he could see his mates, listening with parted
lips to the hubbub outside. He attracted Jim's attention by tossing in a
pebble. Spurling sauntered leisurely toward the rear of the cabin. His
precautions were needless; the remaining sentry had concentrated his
whole attention on the uproar in the cove.

This is an atom: 
"Jim," whispered Percy, hurriedly, "I'm going to jump that guard. You
and Budge stand close to the door. The second you hear any fracas rush
out and take hold with me. Stop him from shouting, if you can."

This is an atom: 
Jim nodded and stepped back from the window. Percy crept stealthily
round the camp toward the fish-house. He rightly inferred that the
smuggler would be gazing down the beach toward the invisible sloop.

This is an atom: 
A well-oiled clock could not have worked more smoothly. The sentry's
thoughts were focused on what was taking place out there in the fog, and
he was all unconscious of the peril that menaced him in the rear.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly out of the blackness behind him a lithe figure shot like a
wildcat. One arm encircled the neck of the astounded guard, the hand
pressing tightly over his mouth. The other hand caught his right wrist
and twisted it backward, causing him to drop his revolver. The force of
the attack flung him flat on his face.

This is an atom: 
Before he could even struggle the door was wrenched open and two figures
darted out and joined in the mêlée. It was soon over. Three to one are
heavy odds. The sentry, gagged and securely bound, was hustled inside
the cabin. His hat, overcoat, and automatic were appropriated for Jim
Spurling, who took his place. So skilfully had the coup been conducted
under cover of the disturbance in the cove that none of the other
smugglers had taken the slightest alarm.

This is an atom: 
Spurling assumed his post none too soon. Hardly had the door been
closed, with Lane, Stevens, and Percy on the alert just inside, when the
other guard came hurrying anxiously back. He had been unable to fathom
the meaning of the tumult on the _Barracouta_.

This is an atom: 
"I don't like this at all, Herb," growled he as he drew near Jim. "Dolph
and the skipper have gotten into some kind of a scrape, but what the
trouble is I can't figure. I'd have gone out to them in the other dory,
but I couldn't find any oars. We'd better call Shane and Parsons away
from guarding those Chinks and decide what it's best to do. We don't
know the lay of the land here, and any mistake's liable to be
expensive."

This is an atom: 
By the time he had finished his remarks he was close to Spurling. The
latter's silence apparently roused his suspicions. He stopped short.

This is an atom: 
"What--"

This is an atom: 
He got no further. Jim's left hand was over his mouth and Jim's right
grasped his right wrist. Out burst reinforcements from the camp. It was
a repetition of the case of the first sentinel, only more so. Presently
Number Two lay on the cabin floor beside his comrade, unable to speak or
move. Jim was a good hand at tying knots.

This is an atom: 
The five boys gathered in a corner and took account of stock. Two of the
six white men prisoners; two others marooned on the sloop and _hors du
combat_, at least temporarily; two still at large and in a condition to
do mischief, but at present entirely ignorant of the plight of their
comrades. Two automatics captured, and the dories of the foe useless
from lack of oars. Best of all, the boys themselves free and practically
masters of the situation. Matters showed a decided improvement over what
they had been a half-hour before.

This is an atom: 
But the victory was as yet incomplete and Jim was too good a general to
lose the battle from over-confidence. At any minute Dolph and Brittler
might burst their way out through the double doors of the _Barracouta_
and establish communication with the two men guarding the Chinese. So
once more the trap was set and baited. Roger put on the hat and coat of
the second sentry and joined Jim on guard.

This is an atom: 
Crash! Crash! Crash! A succession of heavy, splintering blows, echoing
over the cove, announced that the pair imprisoned on the sloop had at
last discovered some means of battering their way to freedom.

This is an atom: 
_Crash-sh!_

This is an atom: 
Speech, low but intense, came floating over the water. The smugglers
were out and evidently looking for their dory. Baffled in their search,
they began shouting.

This is an atom: 
"Hilloo-oo! On shore! Shane! Parsons! Herb! Terry! Are you all dead?
Come out and take us off! Somebody's scuttled the sloop and locked us
down in the cabin! Just wait till we get ashore! We'll fix those boys!
Ahoy there! Our boat's gone! Come and get us!"

This is an atom: 
Jim pressed Roger's arm.

This is an atom: 
"Ready! Here comes one of 'em!"

This is an atom: 
Somebody was running toward them from the fish-house. A black figure
suddenly loomed up, close at hand.

This is an atom: 
"What's the trouble out there, Herb? Dolph and the cap are yelling like
stuck pigs! Hear 'em! Guess I'd better go out to 'em in the other dory,
don't you think? Shane can handle the Chinos--"

This is an atom: 
His voice shut off in a terrified gurgle. A strong hand forcibly sealed
his lips and two pairs of muscular arms held him powerless, while Percy,
darting from the cabin with a coil of rope, relieved him of his
automatic and tied him firmly under Jim's whispered directions. Soon he,
too, lay beside his comrades.

This is an atom: 
"Shut the door a minute, Filippo!" ordered Jim. "Now," he continued,
briskly, "I guess we've got 'em coppered. We'll do up that man in the
fish-house in short order. By the way, Throppy, did you raise the
cutter before the captain smashed your instrument?"

This is an atom: 
"Don't know," answered Stevens. "I was so busy calling for help that I
didn't wait for any reply."

This is an atom: 
"We'll know before midnight," said Jim. "Take Parsons's automatic,
Perce, and come along with Budge and myself. Throppy, you stay here with
Filippo and help guard these fellows."

This is an atom: 
He glanced at the sullen three lying bound on the floor.

This is an atom: 
"Don't look as if they could make much trouble. Still, it's better for
somebody to keep an eye on 'em."

This is an atom: 
Jim, Budge, and Percy stepped out and closed the door. The shouting from
the _Barracouta_ kept on with undiminished vigor. Appeals and threats
jostled one another in the verbal torrent.

This is an atom: 
"Let 'em yell themselves hoarse," whispered Jim. "It won't do 'em any
good."

This is an atom: 
The fish-house was near. A lighted lantern hung just inside the open
door. Near it stood the fourth smuggler, peering anxiously out; behind
him huddled the Chinamen. He gave an exclamation of relief as he saw
Jim's figure approaching through the fog.

This is an atom: 
"I'm glad--"

This is an atom: 
He stopped short, frozen with surprise, at the sight of the three boys.
Swiftly his hand darted toward his left coat pocket.

This is an atom: 
"None of that, Shane!" commanded Jim, sharply. "Put 'em up!"

This is an atom: 
The three automatics in the boys' hands showed the guard that
resistance was useless. He obeyed sulkily.

This is an atom: 
"Feel in his pocket, Perce, and take his revolver! No, the other side!
He's left-handed."

This is an atom: 
Percy secured the weapon. Escorting Shane to the camp, they soon had him
safely trussed. Brittler was bellowing like a mad bull.

This is an atom: 
"Now for Dolph and the skipper! Guess the three of us are good for 'em!"

This is an atom: 
Leaving the four smugglers in the custody of Throppy and Filippo, the
other boys proceeded down to the water. The shouting suddenly ceased. A
rope splashed.

This is an atom: 
"They've cast off the mooring!" exclaimed Jim.

This is an atom: 
Another unmistakable sound.

This is an atom: 
"Now they're rocking the wheel to start her!"

This is an atom: 
Percy felt for the spark-plugs in his pocket.

This is an atom: 
"They'll rock it some time!"

This is an atom: 
They did. At last they stopped. There was a muttered consultation,
inaudible to the listening ears on shore.

This is an atom: 
"Might as well wind the thing up now!" observed Jim in an undertone.

This is an atom: 
"On board the sloop!" he hailed. "It's all off, Captain! We've got your
four men tied up, and we've got their revolvers. You and Dolph might as
well give it up. Throw your guns in on the beach, and we'll come out and
get you, one at a time!"

This is an atom: 
A tremendous surprise was voiced by the absolute silence that followed.
It was broken by Brittler's sneering voice:

This is an atom: 
"So we might as well give up, had we, eh? Guess you don't know Bart
Brittler, sonny! Let 'em have it, Dolph!"

This is an atom: 
_Spang--spang--spang--spang!_

This is an atom: 
A fusillade of revolver-shots woke the echoes. The bullets spattered in
the water and thudded on the beach. Fortunately no one was hit.

This is an atom: 
"Scatter, fellows!" shouted Jim. And in a lower voice he added, "Don't
fire back!"

This is an atom: 
Silence again. The two on the sloop were evidently reloading. Then came
a regular splashing. The men on the _Barracouta_ were paddling her
ashore. Armed and desperate, now fully aware that the only things
between themselves and a term in a Federal prison were the bullets in
their automatics, they would go to almost any length to escape, even to
the taking of life itself. Plainly there was trouble ahead.

This is an atom: 
The boys came together again at the foot of the sea-wall. Should they
fight or run? It was one or the other. Whatever else they might be,
Dolph and Brittler clearly were not cowards. If there was a fight, it
was certain somebody would be shot, very likely killed. Was the risk
worth taking? Would it not be better to hurry back to the cabin, warn
Filippo and Throppy, and escape up the bank into the woods? The
smugglers, with but two automatics against four, would hardly dare to
follow them.

This is an atom: 
"Way enough, Dolph!" growled Brittler's voice.

This is an atom: 
The sloop had grounded. Splash! Splash! Her two passengers had leaped
out into the water and were making their way to the beach.

This is an atom: 
Jim came to an instant decision. He opened his lips, but the words he
had planned to speak were never uttered. The strong, rhythmical dip of
oars suddenly beat through the fog.

This is an atom: 
"What's the trouble here?" demanded a stern voice.

This is an atom: 
A great surge of thankfulness almost took away Jim's power of speech.

This is an atom: 
"It's the cutter!" he ejaculated, chokingly. "Throppy got her, after
all!"

This is an atom: 
XXIII

This is an atom: 
WHITTINGTON GRIT

This is an atom: 
So far as the smugglers were concerned the game was up. It was one thing
to attempt to overpower a group of boys and appropriate their sloop, but
it was quite another to offer armed resistance to the officers of the
United States revenue service.

This is an atom: 
Dolph and Brittler realized that; they realized, too, that they had
absolutely no chance of escaping from the island, so they stood sullenly
by while Jim told his story to the lieutenant commanding the boat. At
the close of his recital the officer turned to them.

This is an atom: 
"You hear the statements of this young man. What have you to say for
yourselves?"

This is an atom: 
"Nothing now," replied Brittler.

This is an atom: 
"You may hand over your guns."

This is an atom: 
The two surrendered their automatics and were placed under arrest.
Following Jim's guidance, the lieutenant inspected the captured
smugglers in Camp Spurling and the Chinese in the fish-house. Leaving a
guard on shore and taking Jim with him, he went off to make his report
to the captain.

This is an atom: 
"It's a case for the United States commissioner at Portland," decided
the latter. "We'll have to take the whole party there. Guess you boys
had better come along as witnesses. The _Pollux_ was bound east when we
picked up your wireless; but this matter is so important that I'm going
to postpone that trip for a couple of days. I can bring you and the rest
of your party back here early day after to-morrow."

This is an atom: 
It meant to the boys a loss of only two days at the outside. That was a
little thing in comparison with what might have happened if the cutter
had not come.

This is an atom: 
"We'll start without waste of time," resumed the captain. "Lieutenant
Stevenson, you may bring the prisoners aboard."

This is an atom: 
Jim went ashore with the officer to notify his companions and prepare
for this unforeseen journey. Eleven o'clock found the _Pollux_ steaming
west with her thirty-one additional passengers. The passage was
uneventful and they were alongside the wharf in Portland early the next
forenoon.

This is an atom: 
Promptly at two came the hearing before the commissioner. It did not
take long. Brittler and his accomplices were held for trial at the next
term of court, and the Chinese were taken in charge by the immigration
inspector. Before six that night the boys were passing out by Portland
Head in the _Pollux_, bound east. The next morning they landed once more
in Sprowl's Cove, and a few hours later they had fallen back into their
customary routine, as if smugglers were a thing unknown. The leak in the
_Barracouta's_ bow was calked, making her as tight as before.

This is an atom: 
The following day dawned fiery red and it was evident that a fall storm
was brewing. Jim and Percy had to battle with a high sea when they set
and pulled their trawl; and they were glad enough to get back to
Tarpaulin with their catch. By noon a heavy surf was bombarding the
southern shore.

This is an atom: 
Five o'clock found the gale in full blast. A terrific wind whipped the
rain in level sheets over cove and beach and against the low cabin squat
on the sea-wall. Great, white-maned surges came rolling in from the
ocean to boom thunderously on the ledges round Brimstone. The flying
scud made it impossible to see far to windward. It was the worst storm
the boys had experienced since they came to the island.

This is an atom: 
At half past five, after everything had been made snug for the night,
they assembled for supper. On the table smoked a heaping platter of
fresh tongues and cheeks, rolled in meal and fried brown with slices of
salt pork. Another spiderful of the same viands sputtered on the stove.
Hot biscuits and canned peaches crowned the repast. Filippo had done
himself proud.

This is an atom: 
A long-drawn blast howled about the cabin.

This is an atom: 
"Gee!" exclaimed Percy, "but wasn't that a screamer! This is one of the
nights you read about. 'The midnight tempest was shrieking furiously
round the battlements of the old baronial castle!'"

This is an atom: 
"Cut it out, Perce, cut it out!" remonstrated Lane. "You make me feel
ashamed of myself. It's really unkind in you to air your knowledge of
the English classics before such dubs as the rest of us."

This is an atom: 
"Well, at any rate, I'm glad we're under cover. Wonder if the men who
used to go to sea in this cabin enjoyed it anywhere near as much as we
have!"

This is an atom: 
"Not half bad, is it?" said Jim. "Remember how delighted you were when
you got your first sight of it, three months ago?"

This is an atom: 
Percy grinned.

This is an atom: 
"I've changed some since then," he admitted. "Forget that, Jim! It's
ancient history now."

This is an atom: 
As he drew up his soap-box his eye dwelt appreciatively on the
delicacies in the platter.

This is an atom: 
"Aren't you other fellows going to eat anything?" he inquired, with mock
concern. "I don't see any more than enough for myself on that platter.
Don't be so narrow about the food, Filippo!"

This is an atom: 
The Italian pointed to a pan rounded up with uncooked titbits.

This is an atom: 
"Plenty more!"

This is an atom: 
"Good!" said Percy. "I was afraid somebody else might have to go
hungry."

This is an atom: 
All devoted themselves to the contents of their plates. They kept
Filippo busy frying until their appetites were satisfied.

This is an atom: 
Supper was over at last, and the dishes washed and put away. Outside,
the storm raged worse than ever. Stevens sat down to his instrument,
repaired after its damage by Brittler, and put the receivers over his
ears.

This is an atom: 
"Come on, Throppy!" exhorted Lane. "Don't go calling to-night! Get out
of the ether and give some other wireless sharps a look-in! Pull off
that harness and take down your violin. Let's make an evening of it! We
sha'n't have many more."

This is an atom: 
Stevens lifted his hands to remove the headpiece. Suddenly a change came
over his face and his arms dropped slowly. He gave his mates a warning
look. There fell a silence in the cabin. Anxiously the others watched
the operator's tense features. Minutes passed.

This is an atom: 
On a sudden he sprang up and tore off the receivers.

This is an atom: 
"There's a steamer in trouble outside. Name sounded like _Barona_. Her
engine's disabled and she's drifting. Can't be very far off!"

This is an atom: 
The boys felt sober.

This is an atom: 
"It's a hard night for a craft without steerage-way," said Jim. "What's
that? Thunder?"

This is an atom: 
A long, low rumble made itself heard above the storm. It came again, and
yet again. The gloom was lighted for a second by a sudden blaze.

This is an atom: 
"What's that!" exclaimed Jim once more.

This is an atom: 
Between the thunder-peals his ears had caught a single whip-like crack.
A stunning crash followed a lurid glare, lighting up sky and sea. Again
came the sharp detonation, but little louder than a fire-cracker. This
time all heard it.

This is an atom: 
"A signal-gun!"

This is an atom: 
Lane's voice was full of excitement. He sprang to the door and the
others followed. The gale was blowing squarely against the end of the
cabin. So great was its force that Roger had all he could do to push the
door open. Presently the five stood outside, exposed to the full fury of
the blast. For a few seconds all was black.

This is an atom: 
"Look! A rocket!"

This is an atom: 
Up from the pitchy sea southwest of Brimstone shot a line of fire,
curving into an arc and bursting aloft in a shower of many-colored
balls. At its base were dimly visible two slender masts and a white
hull. Almost instantly they vanished; but the boys had seen enough.

This is an atom: 
"A steam-yacht!" cried Jim. "Not more than a half-mile off Brimstone and
drifting straight on the ledges. Looks as if she was a goner!"

This is an atom: 
"Can't we help her somehow?" asked Percy.

This is an atom: 
"I'm afraid not. We couldn't drive the sloop against this gale and sea;
besides, those rollers would swamp a life-boat. All we can do is to get
out on the point and try to save anybody who comes ashore. Put on your
oil-clothes, fellows! Light both the lanterns, Percy! Budge, you and
Throppy each take one of those spare coils of rope! I'll carry another
and the Coston lights. Now I can see why Uncle Tom always insisted on
having a couple of 'em in the cabin. Filippo, you'd better stay here,
keep up a good fire, and make plenty of coffee. There goes another
rocket! The gun, too! I don't blame 'em. Men couldn't be in a worse
fix!"

This is an atom: 
Leaning sidewise against the gale, the little lantern-guided procession
trudged along the sea-wall and stumblingly ascended the slippery path to
the beacon on Brimstone. Sheltering the oil-soaked kindlings with his
body, Jim scratched a match; and in a twinkling long tongues of smoky
flame were streaming wildly to leeward.

This is an atom: 
"Ah! They see us!"

This is an atom: 
Three rockets in quick succession rose from the yacht, now barely a
quarter-mile away. The thunder and lightning were almost continuous.
Every flash told that the imperiled craft was steadily drifting nearer
the dangerous promontory.

This is an atom: 
"She'll strike the Grumblers!" muttered Jim. "And that means she's done
for! If only she was a thousand feet farther east she'd float by into
the cove. Hard luck!"

This is an atom: 
The Grumblers were a collection of jagged rocks, exposed at low tide.
Under the incessant flashes their black heads appeared and disappeared
in a welter of frothy white. It was an ominous spectacle for the men on
the yacht.

This is an atom: 
Taking one of the Coston lights, Jim clambered down on the ledges. Soon
the warning red glare of the torch, held high above his head, was
illumining the rocks and breakers. He held the light aloft until it went
out, then rejoined the others.

This is an atom: 
"They're getting a boat over!" cried Stevens.

This is an atom: 
Half a dozen men, working with frantic haste, were swinging a tender out
to leeward.

This is an atom: 
"No use!" said Jim, despondently. "She won't live a minute in this sea."

This is an atom: 
Ten seconds confirmed his prediction. The yacht rolled. As the boat
struck the water a giant sea filled her. Then came darkness. The next
flash showed the boat drifting bottom up beside the larger craft.
Another tender was launched; it survived one sea, but the next
overturned it. Still a third boat met with the same fate.

This is an atom: 
Every surge was heaving the yacht nearer the breakers with dismaying
speed. A group of figures gathered amidships. Silently, with pale faces,
the boys watched the progress of the doomed craft. She was going to her
death. How could any of those on board escape?

This is an atom: 
Jim threw off his despondency.

This is an atom: 
"Now, fellows," he cried, "the minute she strikes she'll begin to pound
to pieces! Their only chance'll be to run a line ashore. We must get out
as far as we can to catch it."

This is an atom: 
Every billow buried the base of the point in snowy foam and sent the
spray flying far up its rugged front. Using the utmost caution, the boys
descended to the limit of safety. At the next flash they peered eagerly
seaward.

This is an atom: 
The yacht was almost on the Grumblers! Up she heaved on a high surge,
dropped. They caught their breaths. No! Not that time. She rose again.

This is an atom: 
Down ... down ...

This is an atom: 
Suddenly she stopped. A grinding crash reached their ears.

This is an atom: 
"She's struck!" screamed Lane.

This is an atom: 
A blaze of sheet lightning showed her, careened landward, lying
broadside toward them about one hundred feet distant. It was the
beginning of the end. Jim, clinging to a boulder far out on the
streaming ledges, now showered with spray, now buried waist-deep, was
watching every movement of the crew.

This is an atom: 
"They've made a line fast round the foremast!" he shouted back. "They're
going to send its end ashore on a barrel! Watch out!"

This is an atom: 
Presently the tossing cask was visible, drifting rapidly landward. For
the first twenty-five yards its progress was unhindered; then a
half-tide ledge barred its way. It hung on this in the trough of a sea;
but the next billow swept it over. Before long it was bumping on the
rocks almost within Jim's reach.

This is an atom: 
Watching his chance, he lunged forward and caught it. A crashing surge
flung him down heavily and rolled him over and over; but he stuck
stoutly to his prize. When the water ran back he came crawling up on his
hands and knees, sliding the cask before him.

This is an atom: 
"Can't stand!" he explained, briefly. "Ankle hurt! Now muckle onto this
line, everybody, and haul in! They've got a hawser bent on the other
end."

This is an atom: 
A glance toward the yacht told that he was right. It also told that the
peril of her human freight was greater than ever. Each sea, raising her
slightly, dropped her back with her decks at a sharper angle toward the
land. The grinding of the rocks through her steel side could be
distinctly heard.

This is an atom: 
"All together! In she comes! Now ... heave! Now ... heave! Now ...
_heave!_"

This is an atom: 
Their strength doubled by the realization that life hung on their
efforts, the boys swayed at the line until at last they grasped the end
of the hawser. To it was attached another smaller rope for pulling in a
boatswain's chair.

This is an atom: 
Working rapidly, they made the hawser fast round an upright boulder. The
lightning flashes were now less frequent, but lanterns on the ship and
ashore enabled each group to note the other's progress. At last the
slender cableway was rigged. Jim swung a lantern. Another lantern on the
yacht answered.

This is an atom: 
"The smaller line, boys! Pull in! Careful!"

This is an atom: 
As the boys hauled, a figure dangled away from the vessel's side.
Shoreward it swayed, now high above the wave-troughs, now dipping
through a lofty crest. It dragged safely over the inside ledge, while
the boys held their breaths; and presently they were unlashing a man
from the boatswain's chair.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," he said in response to Jim's question, "she's the steam-yacht
_Barona_. Belongs to Churchill Sadler of New York. One of his
millionaire friends chartered her for a short trip to the Maine coast.
Fifteen men aboard. I'm the mate. Came ashore first to see if this rig
would work all right."

This is an atom: 
The chair was already half-way back to the vessel.

This is an atom: 
"They'll send Mr. Whittington next," continued the mate.

This is an atom: 
Percy started with surprise.

This is an atom: 
"What's that? Whittington?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes. John P., the millionaire! He's the man who hired the yacht."

This is an atom: 
"He's my father!" gasped Percy.

This is an atom: 
The mate gave an exclamation of astonishment.

This is an atom: 
"Lucky we got this chair to working or soon you wouldn't have had any
father!"

This is an atom: 
The swinging seat had now reached the yacht. Two men lashed into it a
stout, squarely built figure. The lantern signaled that all was ready
and the shoreward journey began. Percy was shaking so violently that he
could hardly pull. The mate reassured him.

This is an atom: 
"Don't be frightened, young fellow! We'll land him all right!"

This is an atom: 
He added his strength to that of the others, and John P. Whittington
came in faster. He reached the ledge, only twenty-five feet from shore.
Then came disaster!

This is an atom: 
Something gave way on the yacht, and the hawser suddenly slackened,
letting the boatswain's chair drag on the ledge. The end of a swinging
rope caught in a crack. The millionaire stopped short!

This is an atom: 
"Harder!" shouted the mate, setting the example.

This is an atom: 
The boys surged on the rope, but to no avail; they could not budge the
chair. Percy stood motionless with horror.

This is an atom: 
Up curled a huge wave, high over the struggling figure. A thundering
deluge hid him from view. It looked bad for John P. Whittington. Two or
three seas more and it would matter little to him whether he was pulled
in or not.

This is an atom: 
Guttering and rumbling, the water flowed back. Down over the ledges
after it leaped a slim, wiry figure. It was Percy Whittington!

This is an atom: 
He had thrown off his oil-clothes to give his limbs greater freedom. His
head was bare and his light hair stood straight up from his forehead.
Grasping the hawser, he plunged into the sea and dragged himself toward
the rock to which his father was fastened.

This is an atom: 
The group on the point stood silent, watching him struggle yard by yard
through the black water until he gained the ridge. On it lay the figure
in the boatswain's chair, struggling feebly. Percy planted his feet on
the slippery rock. But before he could reach his father another liquid
avalanche buried them both.

This is an atom: 
It seemed to the anxious watchers as if it would never run back. When it
did, the older man sagged from the chair, motionless; the lad still
clung to the hawser. The future of the house of Whittington hung
trembling in the balance.

This is an atom: 
The mate gave a groan.

This is an atom: 
"He can't do it!"

This is an atom: 
At that very instant Percy roused to activity. Even before the ledge was
entirely clear he was leaning over his father, knife in hand. It was
useless to attempt to extricate the rope-end from the crack in which it
was caught; the only thing to do was to cut it. Percy stooped quickly.
Already the next sea was curling over his head. He made a savage assault
upon the rope.

This is an atom: 
Slash! Slash! Twice his arm rose and fell. The billow was breaking down
over him when he leaped erect and flung up his hand.

This is an atom: 
"Pull!" yelled Jim.

This is an atom: 
Just as the flood boiled over the ledge the chair and its senseless
burden jerked away. Percy grasped the lashings and was towed along
behind his father. Dread overcame him as he felt the limpness of the
older man's body.

This is an atom: 
Through the eddying tide ... up over the slippery rocks ... and
presently Jim and the mate were unfastening the bonds that held the
insensible millionaire in the boatswain's chair. They carried him up
near the beacon and laid him down on Percy's oil-clothes.

This is an atom: 
"He's breathing!" said the mate. "He'll come round all right. You'll
know what to do for him. I'll go back and help get the other men off.
Their lives mean just as much to their people as his does to you."

This is an atom: 
Working with Budge and Throppy, he took in the slack of the hawser, and
soon the chair was dancing back to the yacht. Meanwhile Jim and Percy
were working over Mr. Whittington, and before long he recovered his
senses. With a groan he half raised himself.

This is an atom: 
"Where am I?"

This is an atom: 
"You're all right, Dad!"

This is an atom: 
"Percy!"

This is an atom: 
Both father and son showed a depth of feeling Jim would hardly have
credited them with possessing.

This is an atom: 
"You don't need me here any longer," he said. "I'll go down and help
pull the others ashore. Throw these oil-clothes of mine over your
father, Percy, and make him comfortable, and as soon as the rest are
safe we'll carry him to camp."

This is an atom: 
"What's that?" growled the millionaire. "Carry me? I guess you don't
know the Whittingtons, young man!"

This is an atom: 
His jaw set and he rose somewhat unsteadily to his feet.

This is an atom: 
"Come on, Percy! Where's that camp?"

This is an atom: 
Walking slowly, the father leaning on his son's shoulder, the two
disappeared in the darkness. Jim watched them for a few seconds, then
started down over the ledges. The last half-hour had raised his
estimation of the Whittington stock considerably above par.

This is an atom: 
Then for a time, engrossed in life-saving, he forgot everything else. At
last all the men were landed safely. It was none too soon, for the yacht
was now almost down on her side; and it was plain she would pound to
pieces before very long.

This is an atom: 
Rescuers and rescued sought the cabin, where a good fire and hot coffee
awaited them. Whittington, senior, clad in dry clothing, lay in Percy's
bunk. Filippo was bustling to and fro to supply the wants of his
numerous guests. His eyes fell upon a dark-haired, olive-skinned young
man in the rear of the shipwrecked group, and the cup he was carrying
clattered on the floor.

This is an atom: 
"Frank!" he cried. "_Fratello mio!_"

This is an atom: 
The brothers flung themselves into each other's arms. The Whittington
family was not the only happy one in Camp Spurling that night.

This is an atom: 
XXIV

This is an atom: 
CROSSING THE TAPE

This is an atom: 
There was little sleep on Tarpaulin, either for rescuers or rescued,
until the small hours of the morning. The cabin was crowded to its
utmost capacity, as the fish-house was too cold for the drenched,
wearied men. Filippo kept a hot fire going until long after midnight,
and served out coffee galore. During his intervals of leisure he and
Frank conversed in liquid Sicilian.

This is an atom: 
Outside, the storm roared and the surf boomed on the ledges about
Brimstone; beyond in the blackness lay the wrecked _Barona_, hammering
to pieces.

This is an atom: 
Gradually conversation ceased and the camp grew quiet. The boys and
their unexpected guests, sandwiched closely together on the floor and in
the bunks, drifted off into fitful slumber. But John P. Whittington's
eyes remained wide open.

This is an atom: 
He was outstretched in Percy's bunk. His clothes hung drying before the
stove, and he had on an old suit of Jim's, as nothing that Percy wore
was large enough to fit his father's square, bulky figure. Beside him
lay his son, sound asleep. John P. marveled at his regular breathing.
Occasionally he touched the lad with his hand.

This is an atom: 
All his thoughts centered about Percy. He could not but feel that this
brown, wiry fellow who had saved his life was a stranger to him. He
could see with half an eye that a great change had come over the boy
during the summer; he had grown quieter, stronger, far more manly.

This is an atom: 
Yes, Percy had stuck. John Whittington had only half believed that he
could or would; and he had spent a good many valuable hours worrying
over what he should do with his son if he didn't stick. The result
showed that all those hours had been thrown away; but somehow the
millionaire couldn't feel very bad about the waste.

This is an atom: 
He began to wonder if Percy might not have done better in the past if
his father had put in a little more time with him personally and spent
less in mere money-making. He had tried to shift his responsibility off
on somebody else, had hired others to do what he should have taken pains
to do himself. That was a big mistake; John P. Whittington could see it
plainly now. And it had come near being a pretty costly error for him,
for Percy. Well, those days were over. Percy had turned squarely about
and was doing better. Whittington, senior, determined to do better, too.

This is an atom: 
Little by little the gale blew itself out. By daybreak the sky was clear
and the wind had gone down, but the high rollers still wreaked their
wrath on the shattered yacht and thundered on the point. A fiery sun
shot its red rays over the slumberers in the crowded cabin. Filippo
roused yawningly, built the fire, and busied himself about breakfast.

This is an atom: 
Soon everybody was astir. The millionaire's clothes were now dry, and
he dressed with the others. Save for a slight stiffness and a few
bruises, he was all right.

This is an atom: 
After breakfast he went up on Brimstone with Percy and the others to
take a look at the _Barona_. The steel hull lay on its side on the
foaming reef, a battered, crumpled shape, sadly different from the trim
yacht that had left New York so short a time before. A miscellaneous lot
of wreckage was swashing in the surf at the base of the point, and Jim
and some of the crew were salvaging what they could; but it was not very
much.

This is an atom: 
Standing in safety on the promontory in the sunlight of the pleasant
morning, John P. Whittington gazed long at the wreck.

This is an atom: 
"Well," he remarked at last to the captain, who stood beside him, "I
guess I see where I'm out fifty or seventy-five thousand dollars. Might
as well take my medicine without a whimper. It was all my fault. You
wanted to run into Portland when the storm was making up, but I thought
we'd better try for some port nearer the island. I've gotten so into the
habit of having men do as I want them to that I thought the wind and sea
would do the same. But I've learned they won't. It's been an expensive
mistake, and it came altogether too near being more expensive still.
It's up to me to foot the bills. I'll make it all right with you and the
crew and Sadler."

This is an atom: 
The sea was going down rapidly. A council was held. The Rockland boat
would leave Matinicus at half past one, and, as Jim felt that the
_Barracouta_ could easily make the run to the island, it was decided to
send the crew back to New York that very day. The captain and the mate
arranged to remain on Tarpaulin until a wrecking-tug from Boston should
arrive.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Whittington, yielding to the persuasions of Percy and the invitation
of the other boys, consented to take the first vacation of his life and
stop with them a week or ten days, when their season on the island would
close.

This is an atom: 
While the crew were preparing to embark, Filippo approached Jim with his
newly found brother.

This is an atom: 
"I like to go with Frank," he said.

This is an atom: 
"Sorry to have you leave, Filippo," returned Jim. "But I know just how
you feel, and I don't blame you a bit."

This is an atom: 
He called Stevens and Lane aside. Presently the latter went into the
cabin and reappeared with a roll of bills. Jim handed them to the
Italian.

This is an atom: 
"Here's one hundred dollars, Filippo, your share for your summer's work.
You've earned it fairly. If there's anything more coming to you, after
we figure up, I'll send it on. What will your address be? We hope to see
you again some time."

This is an atom: 
Filippo was overcome. Tears of gratitude filled his eyes as he stammered
his thanks. It was arranged that letters in the care of the Italian
consul at Boston would always be forwarded to him.

This is an atom: 
Jim and Throppy took the departing party over to Matinicus on the
_Barracouta_, getting them there in ample time for the Rockland steamer.
The sloop was back at Tarpaulin by four o'clock.

This is an atom: 
Meanwhile John P. Whittington had started on his vacation. Though his
time ran into thousands of dollars a week, he felt he could profitably
spend a little of it in getting acquainted with his boy. One of the
first things his keen eyes noted was the absence of the cigarettes.

This is an atom: 
"Knocked off, eh, Percy? For how long?"

This is an atom: 
"For good, Dad!"

This is an atom: 
The millionaire suppressed a whistle; something had certainly struck
Percy.

This is an atom: 
The next morning, his sturdy figure garbed in oilskins, he started out
with his son and Jim for Clay Bank. He had to acknowledge that rising at
midnight was a little early, even for a man accustomed to work as hard
as he had always done.

This is an atom: 
Out on the shoal he was a silent but interested spectator while the
trawl was being pulled and the fish taken aboard. An old swell was
running, and he speedily discovered that seasickness was another thing
his will could not master. That afternoon he watched Percy skilfully
handle the splitting-knife and later do his part in baiting the trawl.

This is an atom: 
On the morning following he went out lobstering, and found as much to
interest him as on the day before. This is how, in the scale of
things superior and inferior, the affection of Love proceeds, as the
intellect or sentiment proceeds from these intelligible or knowable
objects, to those, or from those to these.

This is an atom: 
CIC. Thus the greater number of sages believe that Nature delights in
this changeful circulation which is seen in the whirling of her
wheel.

This is an atom: 
=Fifth Dialogue.=

This is an atom: 
I.
CIC. Now show me how I may be able for myself to consider the
conditions of these enthusiasts, through that which appears in the
order of the warfare here described.Percy appreciated his father's acceptance of the proffered courtesy.

This is an atom: 
"It's the first time my money ever bought anything for you."

This is an atom: 
The experience was a novel one for them both.

This is an atom: 
Just after light one morning the wrecking-tug from Boston appeared. A
brief examination of the _Barona's_ hull by a diver showed that the
havoc wrought by the sea and rocks had been so great that but little of
value could be saved. So the tug started back that very afternoon, and
the captain and the mate of the yacht went with her.

This is an atom: 
The weather was now much cooler, and the boys were glad that their stay
was to be short. Wild geese were honking overhead in V-shaped lines on
their way south. Mr. Whittington accompanied the others on a gunning
trip to Window Ledge, and came back with a dozen coots. He smacked his
lips over the coot stew and dumplings prepared by Jim. Throppy
dismantled his wireless and packed up his outfit to send away.

This is an atom: 
On their last Thursday at Tarpaulin Uncle Tom Sprowl came in on the
smack with Captain Higgins. He had boarded the _Calista_ at York Island.
Everybody, including Nemo and Oso, was glad to see Uncle Tom. His
rheumatism was fully cured and he was spry and chipper. He was more than
satisfied with what the boys had accomplished during the summer, and he
planned to continue lobstering after their departure.

This is an atom: 
He noted the change in Percy.

This is an atom: 
"Told Jim your son needed salting," he confided to Mr. Whittington.
"He's all right now."

This is an atom: 
The afternoon before they were to leave the island Roger reckoned up his
accounts. They showed that after Uncle Tom's share had been deducted,
Spurling & Company had a thousand dollars to divide. Of this, one
hundred dollars had already been paid to Filippo.

This is an atom: 
Lane handed Percy one hundred and fifty dollars.

This is an atom: 
"I don't want him to take that," objected Mr. Whittington.

This is an atom: 
"We shouldn't feel right if he didn't," said Jim.

This is an atom: 
"Dad," spoke up Percy, "I want it. I've earned it. Look at those hands
and arms. It's the first money I ever had that you didn't give to me.
I'm going to have one of the bills framed behind glass."

This is an atom: 
"He's earned it, fast enough," corroborated Jim. "Let him take it, Mr.
Whittington. We'll all feel better about it if you will."

This is an atom: 
So the millionaire gave his consent, with the mental reservation that in
some way he would make it up to the others later.

This is an atom: 
"What are you going to do with all that wealth, Percy?" he asked. "It
won't keep you very long in gasolene."

This is an atom: 
"Send half of it to Filippo for his brother Frank," replied Percy,
promptly. "He lost about all he had when the _Barona_ was wrecked."

This is an atom: 
Later that afternoon Mr. Whittington took Jim aside out of Percy's
hearing.

This is an atom: 
"Honestly, between us, how has the boy done this summer?"

This is an atom: 
"I wouldn't ask to have anybody take hold any better than he has since
the middle of July."

This is an atom: 
The millionaire looked gratified.

This is an atom: 
"I'm more than pleased at the way things have turned out, and I don't
know how I can ever repay you. Can't I help you somehow in money
matters?"

This is an atom: 
Jim shook his head decidedly.

This is an atom: 
"No, thank you, Mr. Whittington. As I told you at the beginning of the
summer, we're making our own way. Percy is entitled to every cent we've
paid him, and I can honestly say we're glad he's been with us."

This is an atom: 
A half-hour afterward Mr. Whittington found his son alone.

This is an atom: 
"How about those college conditions, Percy?" he asked.

This is an atom: 
"Just finished my work on 'em before the wreck, Dad. I'm ready to take
my exams the minute I strike college. It's been a hard pull, harder even
than the fishing and lobstering, and it's kept me hustling; but I
believe I've won out. Studying isn't so bad. All you've got to do is to
make up your mind to get your lessons, and then get 'em."

This is an atom: 
"That's so in other things besides studying, Percy. You'll find it out
later on."

This is an atom: 
"I guess I don't need to tell you," continued his son, "how much I owe
to Jim Spurling and the others. They're the whitest bunch I ever ran
with, and I wouldn't have missed my summer with them for anything."

This is an atom: 
"Something different from what you felt three months ago, eh, Percy?
Remember our talk at Graffam Academy, Commencement night?"

This is an atom: 
"Rather guess I do! And, believe me, I sha'n't forget it in a hurry. By
the way, there's one fellow I owe a good deal to that I haven't told
you about yet."

This is an atom: 
He related to his father the story of his two encounters with Jabe. The
older man listened with grim but satisfied attention.

This is an atom: 
"Licked him at last, did you? If you hadn't, I should want you to look
him up and do it now. It's a Whittington habit to carry through what you
begin. Well, Percy, you've certainly made good."

This is an atom: 
A glimmer of pride, the first he had ever shown in his son, crossed his
face.

This is an atom: 
"I blamed you for junking your auto. Now I've gone and junked a yacht
that'll cost me more than fifty times as much. Well, there's no fool
like the old fool! But it's been worth it."

This is an atom: 
He gave his son a look in which affection mingled with pride.

This is an atom: 
"It was quicksilver, kill or cure; and I'm mighty glad it's been cure."

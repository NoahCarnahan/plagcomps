NON-PLAGIARIZED ATOMS: 

------------------------------------------------------------
This is an atom: 
The men had driven away.

This is an atom: 
And their
laughter and singing and shouts grew fainter as the bushes hid them from sight.

This is an atom: 
The women and children remained, with two old men to protect them.

This is an atom: 
They might have gone too,
the hunters said.

This is an atom: 
"What harm could come in the broad daylight?--the bears and panthers were
far away.

This is an atom: 
"

Then Jim, the crack shot of the settlement, said, "We'll drive home the bears in the carts.

This is an atom: 
"

The children shouted and danced as they thought of the sport to come, of the hunters' return
with their game, of the bonfires they always built.

This is an atom: 
That made the men all laugh.

This is an atom: 
" they cried; "why, there've been none here for twenty
years!

This is an atom: 
We drove them away, down there"--pointing across the plain--"to a hotter place than
this, where the sand burns their feet and they ride for days for water.

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes," cried her big husband, whose brown beard covered his chest, "and burned two cabins.

This is an atom: 
"

I went with emphasis on: "and suffered damage to his soul.

This is an atom: 
It should, however, I hope we do not come.

This is an atom: 
Let me give you a story to tell -" "No, no, no," said those who "I can see who you are, and
must be defended.

This is an atom: 
"

They started off in the morning cool, toward the mountains where the trees grew.

This is an atom: 
And the long
shadows lessened as the sun crept up the sky.

This is an atom: 
The children played in the dust; clouds rose as they shouted
and ran.

This is an atom: 
But the woman in black still stood by her door, like a spectre in the sunshine, her thin hands
clasped together as she gazed away over the plain toward Mexico.

This is an atom: 
Her face was parched and drawn, as if the sun from the sand had burned into the bone.

This is an atom: 
Her eyes
alone seemed to live; they were hard and bright.

This is an atom: 
Her house was a little away from the rest, on the crest of a hill facing the desert plain.

This is an atom: 
She had heard the words of the bearded man: "Small harm the Indians did.

This is an atom: 
" Had he forgotten
her boy?

This is an atom: 
How could he forget, while she was there to remind them of the dead?

This is an atom: 
The rude letters "Will, gone, '69," she had cut on it with
her own hands.

This is an atom: 
It marked the last place where her boy had played.

This is an atom: 
She remembered how she went
away softly--so he should not cry to follow her--without a word, without a kiss.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, to have that kiss now and die!

This is an atom: 
" But she had gone, unthinking, up the road where the pale
woman lived, then a rosy-cheeked happy bride, not a widow like herself.

This is an atom: 
They laughed and discussed
the newcomers at the settlement.

This is an atom: 
It was a holiday, for the men were away over the hills, cutting
down trees to build their houses with.

This is an atom: 
As they talked there idly, they heard what they thought was the shrill bark of dogs running
up the hill.

This is an atom: 
Round the curve of the road came horses wildly
galloping, and upon their backs--Here the pale woman shrieked and fled.

This is an atom: 
They were Indians,
beating their horses with their bare legs, their black hair streaming in the wind.

This is an atom: 
Like a flash, she had bolted the door and barred the shutters as they galloped up.

This is an atom: 
Through the open back door she saw the women run screaming up the hill, their children
in their arms.

This is an atom: 
Where was hers?

This is an atom: 
She stopped as if turned to stone, then undid the door.

This is an atom: 
She fought with them stronger than ten men.

This is an atom: 
But there were twenty; she was alone.

This is an atom: 
They strangled her, beat
down her face, dragged her upon a horse, and, with her crosswise on the saddle, galloped up
and down, as they fired the cabins and the sheds.

This is an atom: 
Her hands were shackled, and her eyes blind
with blood, but she thought only of her child.

This is an atom: 
"Where could he be?

This is an atom: 
There, where she had left him, stood the child, dazed with surprise.

This is an atom: 
She held out her arms
tied together and called to him to come.

This is an atom: 
" Why had she
not galloped by and never noticed him?

This is an atom: 
But she begged, caught at the horse's head, struggled to get to him; and the Indian stopped
for a moment in his flight and caught up the child and went on.

This is an atom: 
Then the thought came to her of the end of that ride--what was to come--after.

This is an atom: 
And she tried
to drop the boy, to let him slide gently to the ground; but the Indian held them fast.

This is an atom: 
Behind, nearer, came the following men, louder the guns.

This is an atom: 
The horse she was on snorted, staggered
under the weight of the three, and as they reached the plain the child was torn from her, she
was pushed away.

This is an atom: 
But she rose and staggered after them amid the blinding dust.

This is an atom: 
Sobbing, she called to them as she stumbled on.

This is an atom: 
That was all.

This is an atom: 
Her story ended there, with the thundering of horses' hoofs and the taste of
dust in her mouth.

This is an atom: 
When she came
back to life she asked no questions but left her neighbor's house and came to her door, where
she was standing now, and gazed away over the sand where _he_ had gone, down toward Mexico.

This is an atom: 
The years went by, and she was still alone in the house where _two_ should have been.

This is an atom: 
His wife
and Lizzie looked at each other, both studied the various emotions, which in this piece of news
has led them, each in their own way, to hide, Lizzie finally could
no longer hold, and broke out: "Will you permit us because they buy?

This is an atom: 
"

The woman in black pondered, as she had so many times, how she should torture him.

This is an atom: 
She looked at the fire in the stove, and piled on the logs--the logs
that were brought with such trouble from the mountains where the trees grew.

This is an atom: 
She could not
make it hot enough.

This is an atom: 
She dropped on her knees and watched the iron grow red.

This is an atom: 
And the letters
of the maker's name stamped on it grew distinct, and the word "Congress," half defaced, and
the figures "64.

This is an atom: 
she could have kissed the spot, for her child had touched
it Charmed by the glow, when left alone, he laid his baby hand flat on it, and burned deep
into the palm were those letters, "S S, 64.

This is an atom: 
"

She would know him among a million by that mark.

This is an atom: 
Why should she not go to them?

This is an atom: 
There were pools in the plain where
she could drink.

This is an atom: 
That would be enough.

This is an atom: 
The men were away; the women were at work.

This is an atom: 
Who could stop her?

This is an atom: 
She put on her bonnet and started off down the hill through the green bushes.

This is an atom: 
The air was still
crisp, though the sun was hot.

This is an atom: 
She walked quickly, and her dress
grew gray with dust, and the air scorching, as she reached the plain.

This is an atom: 
But she kept on, and
only looked back once at the house on the hill, and at the window where the pale woman sat.

This is an atom: 
The dust choked her, and she stumbled, and the sole of one shoe came half off, and slapped,
and banged, and delayed her as she walked.

This is an atom: 
She tore it off and went on, but the sand cut and
burned her so that she sat down and wept, and wanted to go back for her other pair, the ones
she wore on Sundays.

This is an atom: 
The hill, though, looked so distant that she wearily got up and went on,
on, till she could go no more, and crept under the shadow of a rock.

This is an atom: 
Her throat was parched, and her temples beat wildly.

This is an atom: 
She must go back and start again, strengthened,
fortified.

This is an atom: 
She would start tomorrow, or at night, when the cool would let her get too far to
return.

This is an atom: 
The pale woman came out of her house, and
nodded, but the woman in black did not smile in return.

This is an atom: 
She closed her door, and went up to
her bed, and fell on it, and slept, amid the buzzing of the flies and the fitful flapping of
the window-shade in the breeze.

This is an atom: 
The pale woman sighed and glanced across the plain.

This is an atom: 
The roll of blowing dust was larger, and
more regular, and nearer.

This is an atom: 
The woman shuddered as she watched it creep slowly along behind the
sand mounds.

This is an atom: 
"It always blows," she said to herself, "but not like that, so steadily, so even.

This is an atom: 
"
She strained her eyes, but there was only dust to be seen.

This is an atom: 
Then she thought of a telescope
that belonged to the minister's wife, who came from a seaport town, and ran to fetch it.

This is an atom: 
The
two women came out with it together, the minister's wife laughing at her friend, she was such
a timid thing!

This is an atom: 
But the pale woman was paler than ever, and trembled so she could not steady
it.

This is an atom: 
The laughing one looked through it, and laughed no more.

This is an atom: 
"

"For what?

This is an atom: 
"

"They may be friends--"

"They are Indians!

This is an atom: 
White men would not live through that sand.

This is an atom: 
In a moment all was wild confusion, names were called,
but not loudly, girls sobbed, some carried their little treasures, mothers held their children.

This is an atom: 
All gathered together, hidden from the plain by a house.

This is an atom: 
The pale woman led out her father, then ran to her neighbor's door.

This is an atom: 
She opened it, and called
clearly, but softly, "Mary, Mary.

This is an atom: 
Her neighbor hesitated, then hurried after the others, as they ran up the low hills toward
the mountains, where their men had gone.

This is an atom: 
But all was as still as the
grave.

This is an atom: 
The woman in black slept heavily and dreamed that revenge had come at last--that in
her hand she held an Indian's head.

This is an atom: 
The window-shade flapped loudly, and she woke with an apprehension crushing her.

This is an atom: 
She went to
the window and looked out.

This is an atom: 
There was no blowing dust upon the plains, and the street was empty.

This is an atom: 
The woman leaned
out and looked toward the woods.

This is an atom: 
She saw on the crest of a hill the white skirts of the flying women, and then, below, down
the road, her ears sharpened, her heart tightening, she heard the soft, regular thumping of
horses' feet.

This is an atom: 
This was what she had waited for!

This is an atom: 
Where was her gun?

This is an atom: 
She had loaned it to the men.

This is an atom: 
But her axe--that was below.

This is an atom: 
As she started for it, there was a burst of war cries.

This is an atom: 
She ran down the narrow stairs, and took the axe from its place on the wall.

This is an atom: 
They were passing her door.

This is an atom: 
She set her teeth hard, hid the axe behind her skirts, watched
him motionless.

This is an atom: 
He stretched out his hand clawlike, and laughed, his eyes gleaming, as catlike he moved nearer,
A terror seized her: with a hoarse cry, she sprang up the stairs, flinging down a chair as
he followed panting.

This is an atom: 
Quickly she climbed up the ladder to the loft, threw down the trapdoor, fell on it, bolted
it, waited.

This is an atom: 
She stooped noiselessly and
put her ear upon the floor.

This is an atom: 
There was soft breathing underneath, and through a crack in the
floor she saw an eye peering up at her.

This is an atom: 
Her back was to the bolt, but suddenly she _felt_ that there was something there.

This is an atom: 
The slender fingers touched the bolt and gently drew it back.

This is an atom: 
Then with the force of all her hatred fell the axe upon the wrist.

This is an atom: 
With a howl of agony the creature fell bumping beneath.

This is an atom: 
Her face was wet and warm with the spattered blood.

This is an atom: 
Outside she heard the crackling of a burning house, then gunshots far away, and distant shouts.

This is an atom: 
On tiptoe she went to the garret window, and peeped round its edge.

This is an atom: 
One house was blazing--the minister's.

This is an atom: 
Near her door, grazing, stood a riderless horse.

This is an atom: 
As they rode past, they
caught at it, but were stopped by a shout from her door.

This is an atom: 
In his language he shrieked to them for revenge,
pointing up with his red wrist to the attic where she stood.

This is an atom: 
His father's sermons, he wrote from his own tendencies and held
them secretly in closed doors, after he set up his father's wig
and his coat umgetan, the wigs and wardrobe floor again.

This is an atom: 
Then the women and the children came and added to the din, and the men who had followed returned.

This is an atom: 
But the woman in black sat alone in the loft, till she heard the crowd at her door below, and
the voice of the pale woman say:

"Where is Mary?

This is an atom: 
"

She rose and lifted the trap-door--it was unbolted--and went down.

This is an atom: 
The pale woman came to her, but she pushed her aside, and wiped her face with her sleeve.

This is an atom: 
"Are they killed?

This is an atom: 
" "No harm
this time," said the bearded man.

This is an atom: 
"Except my house, it is burned," said the minister's wife.

This is an atom: 
"

"I don't mean _you!_" cried the woman in black.

This is an atom: 
"I mean them--red devils.

This is an atom: 
Have you got any?--killed
any?

This is an atom: 
_You_"--this to Jim, who never missed a shot--"you"--this to the bearded man--"have _you_
killed any?

This is an atom: 
"

And one man said, "Their horses were faster than ours.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, one; better than killed.

This is an atom: 
"
The women shrunk from her as she darted up the stair.

This is an atom: 
They will leave him some day to die in the sand.

This is an atom: 
" The
women shuddered and drew back; the men crowded round, but they did not touch the hand.

This is an atom: 
"Are you afraid?

This is an atom: 
"Afraid of that thing!

This is an atom: 
"

She bent back the fingers and looked in it with a smile of contempt.

This is an atom: 
Her face took an ashen
hue: the hand struck the table edge and fell upon the floor.

This is an atom: 
She seemed to be trying to think
for a second, then she gave one awful cry, and leaned her face against the wall, with her hands
hanging at her side.

This is an atom: 
The pale woman tried to go to her, but her husband drew her back, and, with a silent crowd
around, slowly picked up the hand.

This is an atom: 
For a second he hesitated, then did as she had done, but gently.

This is an atom: 
He bent back the fingers of
the severed hand and read its history written there, "S S, 64," in white letters on the palm.

This is an atom: 
He remembered then how, twenty years ago, when she brought the child to him, he had tied its
little hand in cooling salve.

This is an atom: 
The whisper went around, "It is her boy's hand," and they crept toward the door.

This is an atom: 
The pale woman took a flower from her dress, one she had put there hours before, and placed
it in the brown fingers on the table and went out.

This is an atom: 
"It is there," and the bearded man closed the door gently behind him.

This is an atom: 
Her hard eyes were dim now.. She took the hand from the table and
undid her dress and placed it in her breast, and went to the window, and watched, far off,
a cloud of dust made golden by the sun, as it rolled away across the plain, down toward Mexico.

This is an atom: 
﻿THE INDIAN'S HAND

By Lorimer Stoddard

Copyright, 1892, by J. B. Lippincott & Co.

This is an atom: 
Their carts and horses disappeared behind the roll of the low hills.

This is an atom: 
They appeared now and then, like boats on the crest of a wave, further each time.

This is an atom: 
They'd be back by night, with only two carts to fill.

This is an atom: 
One pale woman clung to her husband's arm.

This is an atom: 
"But the Indians!

This is an atom: 
" she said.

This is an atom: 
"Indians!

This is an atom: 
"

The pale woman murmured, "Ah, but they returned.

This is an atom: 
Small harm they did, the curs!

This is an atom: 
The woman in black stood silent by her door.

This is an atom: 
No one bade her good-by.

This is an atom: 
The other women went
back to their houses to work.

This is an atom: 
A day's freedom lay before them.

This is an atom: 
Near her house
was a small rock roughly marked.

This is an atom: 
Here her hands beat the side of the house.

This is an atom: 
Startled, they went to the window.

This is an atom: 
She turned
then.

This is an atom: 
Their children!

This is an atom: 
They dragged her out by the wrists, by the hair.

This is an atom: 
The little street was empty.

This is an atom: 
"

There were gunshots.

This is an atom: 
Down the hills like mad came the white men for their wives and children.

This is an atom: 
Then the Indians turned back toward the plain.

This is an atom: 
They rode past her house.

This is an atom: 
"Fool!

This is an atom: 
fool!

This is an atom: 
" Here the woman in black struck her temples with her hands.

This is an atom: 
"Fool!

This is an atom: 
They must take
her too.

This is an atom: 
Many times she fell.

This is an atom: 
Then she could
go no more.

This is an atom: 
They found her there unconscious.

This is an atom: 
Her friends tended her.

This is an atom: 
No pain
could be too horrible.

This is an atom: 
" Ah, those letters!

This is an atom: 
But he was dead.

This is an atom: 
The Indians remained.

This is an atom: 
The woman in black stood up.

This is an atom: 
The desert must have an end.

This is an atom: 
She would keep on to Mexico.

This is an atom: 
There was no water near.

This is an atom: 
By slow degrees she dragged herself up the hill.

This is an atom: 
"I see a head over the mound there," she said.

This is an atom: 
The pale woman shrieked.

This is an atom: 
"They are miles away.

This is an atom: 
We may have time.

This is an atom: 
"

"To get away.

This is an atom: 
We must go to the woods.

This is an atom: 
Help
me.

This is an atom: 
Warn the women.

This is an atom: 
Gather the children.

This is an atom: 
Come.

This is an atom: 
"

She rushed into her house.

This is an atom: 
The other still stood and looked.

This is an atom: 
The dust cloud was a little nearer.

This is an atom: 
" There was no answer.

This is an atom: 
The woman in black, on her bed, slept
on.

This is an atom: 
The dust cloud grew nearer.

This is an atom: 
Now and then a head could be seen.

This is an atom: 
The doors of the houses stood open; a shawl lay in the middle of the road.

This is an atom: 
Then she _knew_.

This is an atom: 
She sat on the edge of the bed.

This is an atom: 
Was it her turn now?--or
theirs again?

This is an atom: 
She could kill _one_.

This is an atom: 
The room grew lighter.

This is an atom: 
She turned.

This is an atom: 
One stood in the open doorway,
black against the sunshine.

This is an atom: 
All was still.

This is an atom: 
Outside she heard the distant yells.

This is an atom: 
She stood a long time, motionless, axe in hand, ready.

This is an atom: 
She turned
softly.

This is an atom: 
A slim brown hand was almost through a crevice in the floor.

This is an atom: 
She raised her axe.

This is an atom: 
The hand sprang up at her.

This is an atom: 
Then all again was still.

This is an atom: 
Over the hills, quite near,
she saw the men returning.

This is an atom: 
The Indians were retreating.

This is an atom: 
_She_ knew its owner.

This is an atom: 
An Indian rushed out, handsome, young,
holding aloft a bare right arm without a hand.

This is an atom: 
The eyes of the woman shot fire.

This is an atom: 
She leaned far out and shook her fist from the garret window.

This is an atom: 
"One Indian at least!

This is an atom: 
"

She hurled the axe at them.

This is an atom: 
Shortly the men returned.

This is an atom: 
Some went by down the hill, after the Indians.

This is an atom: 
Others put out the
fire.

This is an atom: 
All was confusion, bustle, shouts.

This is an atom: 
any of them?

This is an atom: 
" she said.

This is an atom: 
Her friend answered, "No, Mary, not one.

This is an atom: 
"We'll soon have another.

This is an atom: 
"

And the men answered, "No.

This is an atom: 
"

"Not one!

This is an atom: 
" The woman in black drew herself up proudly.

This is an atom: 
Wait.

This is an atom: 
They looked at each other wonderingly.

This is an atom: 
The woman returned with something in her grasp.

This is an atom: 
She flung it on the table.

This is an atom: 
"It is an Indian's
hand.

This is an atom: 
His arm will shrivel to the bone.

This is an atom: 
" said the woman in black.

This is an atom: 
It was larger now.

This is an atom: 
The woman did _not_ stir from the wall.

This is an atom: 
"Leave the hand," she said.

This is an atom: 
The woman in black turned.

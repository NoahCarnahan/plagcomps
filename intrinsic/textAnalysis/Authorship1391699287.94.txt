A PERSONAL FOREWORD

This is an atom: 
The forty years of my presidency and teaching in the Rochester Theological Seminary have been
rewarded by the knowledge that more than a hundred of my pupils have become missionaries in
heathen lands. For many years these former students have been urging me to visit them. Until
recently seminary sessions and literary work have prevented acceptance of their invitations.
When I laid down my official duties, two alternatives presented themselves: I could sit down
and read through the new Encyclopædia Britannica, or I could go round the world. A friend suggested
that I might combine these schemes. The publishers provide a felt-lined trunk to hold the encyclopædia:
I could read it, and circumnavigate the globe at the same time. This proposition, however,
had an air of cumbrousness. I concluded to take my wife as my encyclopædia instead of the books,
and this seemed the more rational since she had, seven or eight years before, made the same
tour of the missions which I had in mind. To her therefore a large part of the information
in the following pages is due, for in all my journey she was my guide, philosopher, and friend.

This is an atom: 
Our tour would not have covered so much ground nor have been so crowded with incidents of interest,
if it had not been for the foresight and assistance of the Reverend Louis Agassiz Gould. He
was a student in our seminary forty years ago, and after his graduation he became a missionary
to China. Though his work abroad lasted only a decade, his interest in missions has never ceased,
and he is an authority with regard to their history and their methods. I was fortunate in securing
him as my courier, secretary, and typewriter, and his companionship enlivened our table intercourse
and our social life. But he was bound that we should see all that there was to be seen. Without
my knowledge he wrote ahead to all the missions which we were to visit, and the result was
almost as if a delegation with brass band met us at every station. We were sight-seeing all
day, and traveling in sleeping-cars all night. Though I had notified the public that I could
preach no more sermons and make no more addresses, I was summoned before nearly every church,
school, and college that we visited, and fifty or sixty extemporized talks were extorted from
me, most of them interpreted to the audience by a pastor or teacher. My letters to home friends
were often written on the platforms of railway stations while we were waiting for our trains,
and after six months of these exhausting labors I still survived.

This is an atom: 
These preliminary remarks are intended to prepare the reader for a final statement, namely,
that the papers which follow were written with no thought of publication. They were simply
a record of travel, set down each week, for the information of relatives and friends. I have
been urged to give them a wider circulation by putting them into print. In doing this I have
added some reflections which, for substance, were also written at intervals on my journey,
and these, with sundry emendations and omissions, I have called my "Conclusions." I submit
both "Observations" and "Conclusions" to the judgment of my readers, in hope that my "Tour
of the Missions" may lead other and more competent observers to appreciate the wonderful attractions
and the immeasurable needs of Oriental lands.

This is an atom: 
I cannot close this personal foreword without expressing to my former students and the many
friends who so hospitably entertained us on our journey, my undying sense of their great kindness,
and my hope that between the lines of my descriptions of what I saw they will discover my earnest
desire to serve the cause of Christ and his truth, even though my impressions may at times
result from my own short-sightedness and ignorance. Only what I have can I give.

A WEEK IN JAPAN

This is an atom: 
The Pacific Ocean was very kind to us, for it answered to its name, and was pacific beyond
all our expectations. Sixteen days of smooth seas and lovely weather brought us by way of Honolulu
to Yokohama. Only the last day of our voyage was dark and rainy. But though the rain continued
after our landing, Japan was picturesque. On four out of our six days we drove about, shut
up in water-tight buggies called "rickshaws." They were like one-hoss-shays, through whose
front windows of isinglass we looked out upon the bare legs of our engineer and conductor,
who took the place of the horse for twenty-five cents an hour.

This is an atom: 
There were other sights on these rainy days--endless processions of slipshod men on wooden
clogs, clattering their way through the narrow streets, while they protected themselves from
the watery downpour by flat oil-paper umbrellas; other strong-limbed men acting as wheel-horses
to draw or push incredible weights of lumber; and saving themselves from the wet by bushy coats
of straw that made them look like porcupines; women, little and big, carrying babies on their
backs, occasionally a girl, aged anywhere from four to eight, loaded with a baby aged two;
shops, shops, shops, one-storied, artistic, fantastic, with signs on which Ah Sing and Ah Tong
have mingled Chinese characters and English, and which inform you that the proprietors can
furnish you with the _sake_ of Japan or the gasoline of the Standard Oil Company; these things
convince you that you are in the midst of a crowded population struggling for subsistence and
ready to work, a population of inexhaustible vitality and enterprise.

This is an atom: 
Our first rainy day was distinguished by a visit to the palatial mansion of a Japanese millionaire.
Mr. Asano, the President of the Steamship Company that brought us thither, had invited the
whole lot of first-class passengers to afternoon tea at his house in Tokyo. That house is a
veritable museum of Japanese art. It reminded us of the collections of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan.
There was a great retinue of servants, and we were escorted upon arrival to one of the topmost
rooms, where we were served with tea and presented with symbolic cakes by a dozen gorgeously
bedecked young girls, who proved to be the children and grandchildren of our host. This, however,
was only a preparatory welcome, for it was followed by the real reception in a great audience-room
below, where Mr. and Mrs. Asano, together with their eldest son and daughter, gave us cordial
greetings. A couple of hundred of our fellow passengers were gathered there and were partaking
of light refreshments, with claret, tea, and mineral waters, while an expert Japanese juggler
amused them with his feats of sleight of hand. The tapestries and paintings of this house were
exquisite products of taste and skill, and the total effect was that of great wealth accompanied
by true love for the beautiful. But it was the mansion of an orthodox Shinto and Buddhist,
for in every large room there was an alcove with the sitting figure of a bronze Buddha.

This is an atom: 
A more distinctly Christian entertainment for that same rainy day was our reception by the
Conference of Baptist missionaries and workers at the new Tabernacle in Tokyo. They had been
called to meet Doctor Franklin and Doctor Anderson, who had been sent by our Foreign Missionary
Society to consult with them as to our educational policy in Japan. We reached the Conference
on its last day of meeting, and we had a most valued opportunity of observing its method of
procedure. Half of those present were Japanese workers who did not understand English, and
it was a new experience to address them when every word had to be interpreted. The social intercourse
that followed was delightful, for it enabled us to greet our former pupils in considerable
numbers. We then took lunch at the house of Doctor Axling, the pastor of the Tokyo church,
while Doctor Tenny is President of the Theological Seminary. The little Japanese missionary
home, with its tiny secluded garden, its paper partitions, and its mingled reminders of an
American household, were things long to be remembered. Not less to be noted was the gratitude
for our visit which was shown by our hosts. We had regarded ourselves as the persons honored
and entertained. We learned that missionaries in a heathen land wonderfully appreciate the
sight and the companionship of friends from their distant home.

This is an atom: 
Even more unexpected was our reception at the Women's College of Japan. Since I had been more
than thirty years a trustee of Vassar College, and for some years chairman of its board of
trustees, Mrs. Strong and I were the guests of honor, and I was the first speaker called upon.
Before me were five hundred young women in more somber dress than prevails at Vassar. All rose
to welcome me at the beginning of my address, and all rose again to thank me at its conclusion.
Most of these students understood only Japanese and needed an interpreter. Doctor Zumoto, the
accomplished editor of the Japanese "Herald of Asia," translated my address into his own language
after I had finished, having taken notes while I spoke. Until the very end I had the impression
that this was a Christian college, and I innocently made the Lord Jesus the center and substance
of my remarks, declaring that the renaissance of learning in Japan needed to be supplemented
by a reformation of religion. Only when the evening was over did I learn that the institution
was not only undenominational, but also non-religious, having Buddhist as well as Christian
professors. Doctors Anderson and Franklin were also guests, and when they followed me, they
made the same mistake and made Christian addresses. But the Japanese management is very polite
and very liberal, and even in the dinner that followed our _faux pas_ did not provoke a word
of criticism. The guests at that dinner served by the students were from the most prominent
educational institutions of Japan. We highly appreciated the honor done us, and did not regret
that in our ignorance of the situation we had given to that distinguished audience the true
gospel of Christ.

This is an atom: 
Another dinner of a very different sort was that which we ourselves gave at the Grand Hotel
of Yokohama to the Rochester men. To my surprise twenty-four persons sat down, but this number
included at least ten of the wives. Chiba and Axling, Tenny and Topping, the Fishers, father
and son, Clement, Brown, Benninghoff, Takagaki, Kawaguchi, all except the last with their wives,
made up the list. I was proud of them, for they are leaders of thought and of education in
Japan. Only Doctor Bearing's absence on furlough in America, a furlough ended only by his lamented
death, prevented us from inviting him, though he was not a Rochester man. Reminiscences of
seminary life were both pathetic and amusing at that dinner. One thing impressed itself upon
my mind and memory: Our missionaries have not lost their sense of humor. Under all their burdens
of anxiety and responsibility they have retained their sanity, their hopefulness, and their
good fellowship. The hilarity of our gathering was the bubbling over of cheerful dispositions,
and the safety-valve gave evidence that there were large reserves of steam. Missionaries are
not a solemn set. They are only a good set of human beings made in the divine image, for is
it not written that even "He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh"?

This is an atom: 
The next day was the brightest of the bright. We took advantage of it to visit the great temple
of Kamakura, and to inspect the greatest artistic monument of Japan, the bronze image of Buddha.
It is a sitting statue, with folded hands and eyes closed, as if absorbed in mystic contemplation
of his own excellence as a manifestation of deity, and careless of the sorrows and sins of
the world. The great bronze image is fifty feet high, but it is hollow. We entered it, climbed
up by ladders to its shoulders, and looked out of windows in its back. Its hollowness seemed
symbolic, for it has only the outward semblance of divinity and is deaf to all human entreaties.
On that same day we visited the temple of Hachiman, the god of war, most spacious and impressive
in its park-like surroundings of ancient trees and noble gateways, but fearful in its accompanying
images of revenge and slaughter. Humanity needs compassion in the Godhead. The Japanese have
felt this, and they have invented a goddess of mercy, Kwannon by name. Her shrine is the richest
in Japan. It constitutes one of the greatest attractions of the capital. Millions visit it
every year, and the offerings of its worshipers support a whole colony of Buddhist priests.
The avenue leading to the temple is lined with shops where mementoes of the goddess may be
purchased, as in Ephesus of old silver shrines might be bought in honor of the great goddess
Diana. It is the old story of buyers and sellers in the Jewish temple. It was most pathetic
to see a well-dressed and handsome woman bend herself almost double before the image, clap
her hands to call the attention of the goddess, and then fold them in prayer, possibly for
the child that had hitherto been denied her. It is well understood in this temple that, until
the clink of coin is heard in the collection-box, it is vain to suppose that even the goddess
of mercy will listen to a prayer.

This is an atom: 
The god of war reigns in Japan, rather than the goddess of mercy. War is more profitable. The
sale of munitions to the Russian Government is enriching Japan, as our sales to the Allies
are enriching us. The love of gain is an obstacle to the success of the gospel, here as well
as in America. Nothing but a mighty influence of the Holy Spirit can convince Japan of sin,
and bring her to the feet of Christ. The work of our missionaries, however, is permeating all
the strata of society. Western science and Western literature are so bound up with Christianity
that Japan cannot easily accept them without also accepting Christ.

This is an atom: 
We wished to see mission work in a country field, and we begged Mrs. Fisher to go with us to
Kanagawa, a suburb of Yokohama, where an educated milkman is pastor, and where the Mary Colby
School of Christian girls attends the worship of his church. The reverence and sincerity of
the service impressed us. The warmth and abandon of the singing put to shame our Western quartet
choirs. Here is a pastor who prefers to supplement his meager salary by selling milk on week-days,
rather than give up the satisfaction of seeing his church entirely self-supporting. It seemed
to me the model of a good ministry, and the prophecy of a multitude of New Testament churches
in Japan, manned and financed and governed by the Japanese themselves. So long as we of the
West furnish both the preachers and their salaries, the Japanese will not learn to depend upon
their own administration or their own giving, and we will not have churches organized on correct
principles and so rooted in the soil that they can stand the shocks of time and endlessly propagate
the gospel. May "the little one" in Kanagawa "become a thousand"!

This is an atom: 
Japan is a country where "every prospect pleases, and only man is vile." Immorality is its
curse. There is little drunkenness indeed, and gambling is strictly prohibited. But the relations
of the sexes are almost wholly unregulated. Patriotism and filial devotion take exaggerated
forms, and girls can lead a life of shame in order to provide means for the education of their
brothers. General Nogi and his wife can commit suicide when his sons are killed in battle,
and the whole country can regard it as so noble a deed that the general's desire to extinguish
his family name is not permitted to prevent the adoption of it by another. The Japanese are
a nation of wonderful natural gifts. Honor, enterprise, submission, accessibility to new ideas,
powers of imitation and invention, make them the leaders of the Orient. Steamships of twenty-two
thousand tons, and equal to any Atlantic Cunarders, yet built in their own dockyards by shipwrights
who twenty years ago knew nothing of their trade, are a proof of extraordinary plasticity and
ability. Civilization and Christianity may find new expression, if the Japanese are subdued
by the Cross of Christ.

This is an atom: 
My interest in missions has been doubled since I came in contact with the practical work of
our missionaries. We have able and devoted representatives on this foreign field, and I believe
that God will make them mighty to dethrone Buddhism, and to crown Christ Lord of all. Yes,
"every prospect pleases." When I sailed through the Inland Sea of Japan, two hundred and forty
miles long, studded with hundreds of islands small and great, islands often surmounted with
glistening white temples or fortifications, I thought our Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence,
and even the Isles of the Greek Ægean, were not to be mentioned in comparison. The landlocked
harbor of Nagasaki, with its encircling hills, is finer than our Golden Gate of the Pacific.
Fuji-yama, snow-capped and symmetrical, seen against the crimson sunset sky, is more beautiful
even than Mount Ranier when seen from Tacoma, or Vesuvius when seen from Naples. Japan is a
land for poetry and song, a land to awaken the loftiest patriotism, a land to inspire and lead
the world. Provided, ah yes! provided, it can be converted to Christ, and made his servant.
The Japanese is a natural orator; he has organizing ability of the highest order; he is accessible,
yet independent. Now is the time to make him a preacher of the gospel to all the East. China
and India have already felt the influence of his military and political progress. Let us, by
pouring in the light of Christianity, make him also their leader in true religion!

This is an atom: 
A WEEK-END IN CHINA

This is an atom: 
Hongkong is a city wonderful for situation and for trade. It has a landlocked harbor encircled
by precipitous hills and large enough to float the navies of the world. It is the second largest
port on earth for exports and imports, over six hundred million dollars' worth in a year. It
is a meeting-place of the East and the West, a fortress of Britain in China, a conglomeration
of people, a center of influence for Japan and for India, an object-lesson in sanitation, education,
and municipal government. The dominating religion is that of the Church of England, and the
Hongkong University, though endowed in part by wealthy Chinese, follows English models and
has a staff of English professors.

This is an atom: 
I mention Hongkong only to make more clear my description of Swatow, its northern neighbor.
The situation of Swatow is very like that of Hongkong. A noble harbor encircled by steep hills,
it is one of the chief ports between Hongkong and Shanghai, and only a single night's steamer-ride
from Hongkong. Its attraction to us lay in the fact that it is more Chinese than Hongkong,
a principal seat of Presbyterian and Baptist missions, and not so dominated as is Hongkong
by the Church of England. As Hongkong is an island, so our Baptist Mission Compound is on an
island, separated from the city of Swatow by the bay on which hundreds of sampans and fishing-boats
with lateen sails are always riding, and at whose wharves many a great steamship is loading
or unloading freight. When our vessel arrived, we were quickly surrounded by a multitude of
smaller craft, manned by clamorous tradesmen selling wares or seeking employment. The commissioner
of British customs, who was our fellow passenger, most courteously invited us to share his
motor-launch, and when we had landed on the other side of the bay he sent us up the hill to
the mission compound in two of his sedan-chairs, each one borne by two stout men in picturesque
uniform: and wearing the insignia of the customs office.

This is an atom: 
A word about the English customs may be interesting. To satisfy English creditors, and later,
to pay interest on indemnities for the Boxer uprising, China mortgaged the larger part of her
duties on foreign imports. Sir Robert Hart was appointed Inspector General, to superintend
this collection of duties. He introduced system and honesty, where before there had been only
disorder and peculation. From twenty to thirty million dollars are in this way collected every
year. Swatow is the third port in the amount thus obtained, itself furnishing two to three
millions of the aggregate result. But this putting her collection of customs into the hands
of foreigners, though it has taught China her own wastefulness and the superiority of Western
finance, is a burden so humiliating that it cannot always continue. When China fully awakes,
she will realize her strength and will reclaim what her weakness ceded to Great Britain.

This is an atom: 
Our mission compound is one of the noblest in the East. It is due to the foresight and executive
ability of Dr. William Ashmore, Senior. He began his missionary work in Bangkok, Siam, but
was transferred by our Missionary Union to Swatow, with the view of opening China to our missionary
efforts. He had Irish blood in his veins. He was witty and eloquent, fervid and passionate.
But he was also a man of grit, and a hero of the faith. He wanted a quiet base of supplies
from which he could send out expeditions into the heart of China. He had no means of any account.
But he saw the possibilities in these steep and barren hillsides opposite Swatow, and for six
hundred dollars he bought a tract which he gradually turned into a garden, with twenty mission
buildings and residences so thrust into the rocks and so overhanging one another, that the
whole plant seems a miracle of engineering. Like a fortress, it commands the city of Swatow
across the bay, very much as Governor's Island commands New York. From its church and its schools
have gone out a score of evangelists and native pastors, to turn Swatow and the whole country
within a radius of a hundred miles into a present seed-plot and a future garden of the Lord.

This is an atom: 
William Ashmore, Senior, died seven years ago. But he left a son of the same name, who is a
Chinese scholar of wide reputation, a sound theologian, and a leader greatly beloved. He has
nearly completed a translation of the Bible into the colloquial Chinese--a felt need of many
years. At his house, so wedged into the rocky hillside that a typhoon might seem equal to washing
it down into the bay, we were most hospitably entertained. Here we spent a memorable Sabbath
Day. At the church service, at least five hundred church-members and pupils of the various
schools were gathered, and I addressed them on "Faith, as Both a Giving and a Taking"--a giving
of one's self, and a taking of Christ to be ours. Doctor Ashmore interpreted my talk to the
audience, sentence by sentence. The whole service was to me an inspiring illustration of New
Testament order and simplicity, for my address and the sermon of Doctor Ashmore which followed
had been preceded by free participation of members of the church, in which one happy father
arose to give thanks for the birth of a girl-baby, after five sons had been given him--a great
change from the time when new-born girls were despised and often thrown out into the street.
This reverent congregation, worshiping God in freedom and sincerity, seemed the prophecy of
a redeemed China. This congeries of schools, from kindergarten to theological seminary, with
Ashmore, Capen, Page, and Waters for instructors, and Groesbeck, Speicher, Lewis, Foster, and
others for evangelists, has already permeated a whole province with Christian teaching. It
needs an institutional plant in the city, where it already has a noble location, and it also
needs a motor-launch to carry its students to the field across the bay, where they can find
opportunity to win the multitude to Christ.

This is an atom: 
Even Swatow is partly Anglicized. We wished to see old China, heathen China, and Brother Groesbeck
gave us the opportunity. Only twenty miles from Swatow lies the city of Chao-yang, where this
pioneer missionary has for eighteen years been stationed. Chao-yang is a larger city than Swatow;
the Chinese count it as containing a population of three hundred thousand. It is the converging
point of all the trade that reaches Swatow from a hundred miles to the south and the west.
Yet all this trade is conducted through a narrow canal, so congested with boats that there
are innumerable delays. Even when the boats reach the waters of the bay, the remaining channel
is shallow for lack of dredging, and launch-progress is very slow. We had ocular proof of this
latter evil; but we at last reached the dock.

This is an atom: 
Then came a reception entirely new to our experience, and one which we can never forget. Eighty
young men from the mission school met us, all in white uniforms with sashes of blue. We passed
through their lines, forty boys on each side baring their heads as we passed. Then a procession
was formed. A brass band, with bugles and resounding drums, led the way. The student escort
followed. After the long rows of boys came an honor-squad of Chinese soldiers, shouldering
their guns and bearing the Chinese and the American flags. This portion of the escort had been
furnished by the Chinese governor, who in this way certainly showed his friendly regard for
the American mission. We concluded the procession, sitting in our sedan-chairs, each of our
party of four borne upon the shoulders of four men. The band struck up, a great explosion of
firecrackers ensued, and we began our journey of a mile and a half to the gates of the city,
and then two miles and a half farther through its crowded streets, until we reached the mission
buildings and the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Groesbeck on the other side of the town. The Chinese
are great on ceremonial, and all this reception had been arranged by the students themselves,
in honor of Mr. Groesbeck's teacher and his teacher's wife. Needless to say that I was astounded
at such a reception, for Augustus Cæsar never made an imperial entry in Rome more thrilling
than the triumphal entry which Augustus Strong made that day into the great city of Chao-yang.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Groesbeck said that no public notice had been given of our coming. Yet the whole population
of three hundred thousand seemed to have come out to meet us. Imagine a street two and a half
miles long, but only ten to fifteen feet wide, thronged with water-carriers and beasts of burden
compelled to give way to our great procession! Every nook and corner of the way, the fronts
of the one-storied shops and the entrances to the cross-streets, were all a perfect sea of
faces--rows of children little and big overtopped by rows of half-naked men, with scores of
women peering wistfully from windows in the rear--faces by thousands and tens of thousands,
till it seemed as if the whole population of the planet had emptied itself into Chao-yang.
I looked upon hundreds of splendid forms of men, naked above the waist, and carrying heads
worthy of notice from any sculptor, none of them hateful, all of them impressed and wondering,
and they seemed to me the embodiment of China crying out for God. When we were only half-way
through the city, the endless masses of humanity had so impressed me that I could not restrain
the tears. The sight was simply overwhelming. And all this the parish of one man! It is to
save this great city, now almost wholly given to idolatry, that Mr. Groesbeck asks for money
to build in its very center an assembly-room and an institutional church, and that Doctor Lesher
asks for a hospital building to facilitate his medical work.

This is an atom: 
I made an address to those eighty boys that evening, as they stood at attention before me.
Half of them were still heathen, but their fathers had sent them to this Christian school,
believing that they needed a better religion than that of Confucius or of Buddha. I urged them
to become soldiers of Christ, and to follow him as their Commander. I did not conceal from
them the fact that such following might involve opposition and earthly loss. But I promised
them that, if they suffered with Christ, they would also reign with him.

This is an atom: 
We returned from Chao-yang very sober and thoughtful, for our visit had been a revelation of
appalling needs. Swatow seemed a paradise after such a visit. The smiling faces of so many
Christians, and the signs of a truly Christian civilization, inspired me with new hope for
the future. But our time had come for leaving China, at least temporarily, and India was at
once to be visited. Our departure from Swatow was almost as spectacular as our entry into Chao-yang.
There was no military guard, and there were no firecrackers, but there was a fine brass band
of academy boys, to lead our procession of sedan-chairs, as we passed through the long lines
of scholars who had gathered with their teachers to bid us farewell. The schools were all represented.
First came the little kindergartners, then pupils of the grammar school, the girls' school,
the women's school, the Bible-women's training-school, the boys' academy, and finally, the
theological seminary. They numbered more than three hundred in all. Some of the teachers accompanied
us to the steamer. We parted from them with regret, but we were thankful that they could remain
to prepare the way for a new religion, education, and civilization in China.

This is an atom: 
My week-end in China leaves me with a new sense of the vastness of the heathen world, and of
its absolute dependence upon Christ, as its only possible Saviour. The question whether the
heathen will ever be saved if we do not give them the gospel, is not so serious a one for us
as the other question whether we ourselves will ever be saved if we do not give them the gospel.

This is an atom: 
MANILA, SINGAPORE, AND PENANG

This is an atom: 
Each of these cities might seem to be the New Jerusalem, if you were to see only its European
part and the dress of its inhabitants. Their European residents are all arrayed in white. Not
all of them are saints, however. The white is purely external and compulsory. Heat is a great
leveler, and we are nearing the equator. When we approached Manila we were in the tail of a
typhoon, but the danger was past. Indeed, since we left San Francisco, we have encountered
no storm, have had only smooth seas, and have witnessed continually what Æschylus called "the
innumerable laughter of the ocean waves."

This is an atom: 
It was pleasant to perceive that American enterprise and administration have transformed Manila,
the capital of the Philippine Islands, from a medieval into a modern city. Its newly constructed
streets and pavements, water-works and drainage, electricity and the trolley, have turned this
old and dilapidated Spanish town into a place of order and beauty. Its parks and gardens, its
municipal buildings and hospitals, are an object-lesson to all beholders. The walls of the
fort still remain, but the moat has been filled up. The Roman Catholic Cathedral shows the
large designs of a former priesthood to capture the people by architecture and ceremonial.
But Protestant churches, missions, and schools, are coming to have the first place in popular
esteem. The former palace of the Spanish governor is now the meeting-place of the democratic
legislature, and the Jones Bill, recently passed by our Congress, but now locally known as
"the Bill Jones," has given hopes of a complete and speedy Filipino independence.

This is an atom: 
Our observation of the place, and our intercourse with residents of Manila, lead us to doubt
the wisdom of our immediate relinquishment of authority over these islands. Eager as are the
Filipino leaders for self-government, they have not yet learned the art of self-restraint.
The recent trouble in the great hospital illustrates this. Its American superintendent has
resigned his office, for the reason that his Filipino staff and subordinates conspired to make
discipline and sanitary regulations impossible. They desired to manage the institution themselves,
when they were incompetent to enforce cleanliness and order. What happens in hospital work
happens also in all branches of civil administration. It will take a whole generation to raise
up officials who can be trusted to do their work for the public good, rather than to provide
comfortable and remunerative positions for themselves.

This is an atom: 
We visited the spot, five miles away, where our American troops, under Admiral Dewey, landed
to besiege the town. We motored to Fort McKinley also, where our soldiers still command the
situation. But our main interest was in the mission schools and in the interdenominational
theological seminary. In these educational institutions all the instruction is in the English
language. They are Americanizing as well as evangelizing the population. The establishment
of universal and compulsory school attendance will in a few years turn a Spanish-speaking into
an English-speaking people, and will unify the education and the civilization of the islands.
Nothing indeed is more remarkable in the Orient than the gradual superseding of the native
dialects by the printed and spoken English. In the great country of India, it is to be remembered,
English is the required language in school and court, as well as in every government office.
Even the Romanizing of written Chinese and Japanese will make vastly easier the political unity
and the religious evangelization of China and Japan.

This is an atom: 
When we reached Singapore, we found ourselves in one of the world's greatest ports of entry.
It is also one of the keys to the Orient, as Sir Thomas Raffles perceived more than a century
ago. Its splendid government buildings and its strong fortifications show that the British
propose to hold it to the end. The recent incipient revolt, which was fortunately nipped in
the bud when it seemed to the conspirators on the verge of success, and which was punished
by the summary execution of thirty or forty rebels without the news of it getting into the
papers, showed that Germany had much to hope for and Britain much to fear from the unrest of
these heterogeneous populations. I had a vivid reminder of all this at the Methodist Episcopal
Mission, where I found over sixteen hundred scholars in attendance, and where I addressed five
hundred of them at their morning prayers. One of the chief difficulties of Christian work in
Singapore is the aggregation and mixture of races. Seven different nationalities are represented
in the schools. The Tamil, the Malay, and the Chinese are the most numerous, and of these the
Chinese take the lead. Fifty thousand Chinese immigrants enter the port of Singapore every
year, mainly because there is employment for them in the rubber plantations of the Straits
Settlements. The congestion of population in China drives them southward to Singapore, and
from Singapore they swarm northward to Burma, southward to Java, and westward to India.

This is an atom: 
This mixing up of the many different nationalities makes it impossible for the missions in
Singapore to teach their pupils in any other language than the English. This requisition of
English seems to some of the people a slur upon their own tongue, and a sign of British ascendency.
They are jealous of the English, even while they perceive their own dependence upon them. Only
British justice and watchfulness can keep in check the disposition to revolt on the part of
some classes with which the government has to deal, especially when these classes are stirred
up by German spies and German money. Thus far all seditious attempts have been put down, and
the traveler learns to bless the wisdom of British administration, and to rest secure and confident
under the folds of the Union Jack.

This is an atom: 
We left Singapore for Penang with some regret, for the reason that large steamers must be exchanged
for small steamers. The one we took was exceedingly good and modern. Another on which we embarked
somewhat later seemed to have come down from the days of Noah and the ark. But British steamers,
however old and small, are clean and safe. You "get there" all the same. On our way to Rangoon
our first stop was at Port Swetterham, from which we motored twenty-seven miles to Kuala Lumpur,
the capital of the Federated Malay States--federated under the British Crown. Here is a city
of Malays and Chinese, with British government buildings, Mohammedan mosques, Buddhist temples,
an English cathedral, and a Methodist church. Our road thither led us through seemingly endless
forests of rubber trees and of coconut palms. The profusion of tropical vegetation was both
novel and impressive. These Federated Malay States furnish the world with more than half its
supply of rubber, and many English and American investors are growing rich from the soaring
of prices induced by the war.

This is an atom: 
Penang, however, furnished us with our greatest sensation. It was a Chinese funeral. In this
city of two hundred thousand inhabitants, a millionaire Chinese banker had died. He was a Buddhist
as well as a Confucianist, but also a loyal and patriotic supporter of charitable institutions,
and of the British rule. He had given to the British government a number of aeroplanes to facilitate
its military operations, and a large sum of money for its war-loan. When he died, the customary
worship of ancestors, which is a part of Chinese religion, as well as gratitude for his past
gifts, prompted his family to plan a sumptuous funeral. It is said to have cost them thirty
thousand dollars. We arrived in Penang just in time to see the show. All the way from Singapore,
indeed, we were accompanied on our steamer by a fine brass band, which was only one of three
brass bands hired to furnish music for the funeral service.

This is an atom: 
My powers of description fail, when I attempt to tell the wonders of a funeral procession fully
a half mile long. It was headed by a symbolic float of waxwork figures, in which a colossal
horse, prancing on its hind legs, seemed just about to soar into the air. The horse was held
in by four angelic forms following and holding in their hands scepters of royalty. This apparition
reminded me of the horses and chariot in which Elijah ascended to heaven, and it seemed to
indicate that the deceased had departed with all the honors heaven and earth could bestow.
A band of music accompanying the float, and playing solemn but not mournful strains, gave color
to this interpretation. A retinue of sedan-chairs, decorated with all the colors of the rainbow,
came next in order. These sedan-chairs were empty of occupants, and contained long strips of
red paper on which were written the names and merits of the millionaire's ancestors, to be
read by Buddhist priests at the grave. The chairs were each the gift of some relative or friend
of the departed. They symbolized the welcome given him by those who had gone before him to
the better land. A second band of music was followed by a body-guard of British soldiers in
khaki, deputed by the British governor to show his estimate of the character and loyalty of
the deceased.

This is an atom: 
Then came the hearse, if hearse it could be called. It was really an enormous catafalque, decorated
with gold tinsel and costly embroideries. Peacocks and birds of paradise were depicted on its
silken hangings. A dozen men, in elaborate robes of blue, carried this gaudy structure upon
their shoulders, while other gorgeously attired attendants bore great ribbon-banners of satin,
say twenty feet long by four feet wide and of the most brilliant colors, inscribed with Chinese
characters and making known the virtues of the departed. But the most curious part of the procession,
was yet to come. Preceded by the third band of music were the offerings of food and drinks
which were to furnish sustenance to the spirit in the world into which he had now entered.
There were six roasted sucking-pigs, laid in order, on portable tables, with baskets of rice,
oranges, bananas, all kinds of fruit and confectionery, and cups of tea and wines. These were
carried to the cemetery, to be presented to the departed spirit at the grave, then jealously
guarded for an interval, finally in part given to the officiating priests, and in part consumed
at a feast held by the surviving members of the family. The costlier the offerings, the better
would the feast be enjoyed. There was no lack of priests in this ceremonial. They were young
and clean-shaven, and looked as if they had enlisted for this very service. I thought I could
discern a sly twinkle in their eyes, as they inspected the preparations for the feast, before
the march began.

This is an atom: 
The mourners must not be forgotten. Among the Chinese, white, and not black, is the appointed
sign of mourning. The four wives of the deceased and the members of his family were accordingly
dressed in the coarsest of white sackcloth, with ashes sprinkled over their faces, and they
walked behind the hearse, howling. It was a piteous spectacle, reminding one of the professional
and hired wailers in Palestine, where "the mourners go about the streets," uttering dismal
lamentations which can be bought for money. Far be it from me to suggest that such was the
lamentation which we heard that day, for there is reason to believe that in this case the deceased
was respected and beloved.

This is an atom: 
This ceremonial had required long and elaborate preparation. The death indeed occurred last
July; the body had been embalmed; it had lain in state and open to public inspection for four
whole months; the funeral did not take place until November. A vast amount of detail had been
attended to and provided for. Great packages of silken umbrellas had been stored to shield
the heads of guests and servants. All the bearers of sedan-chairs, scores in number, were clad
in silken uniforms; there were banners, and inscriptions, and lanterns, galore. Everything
was done to impress the Chinese multitude with the greatness of the occasion. But it was all
a glorification of man and of his virtues. There was no confession of sin, nor assurance of
pardon; no proclamation of a divine Redeemer; no promise of life and immortality in Christ.
Heathen religions are man's vain effort to win heaven by merits of one's own. Only Christianity
is God's revelation of salvation "without money and without price," through the sacrifice and
death of his only Son. This is the gospel which Confucianist and Buddhist, Hindu and Mohammedan,
need to-day, and which, thank God, our missionaries are giving them.

This is an atom: 
THREE WEEKS IN BURMA

This is an atom: 
Burma is the land of pagodas. These places of worship are the most striking feature of every
landscape. Their bell-shaped domes, startlingly white, or so covered with gold-leaf as to shine
resplendent in the sunlight, crown many a hilltop and constitute the chief beauty of the towns.
The pagodas are usually solid structures of brick, with facings of plaster, and they are buildings
at which, rather than in which, worship is offered. There are exceptions, however. The more
ancient of these edifices, like the Ananda at Pagan, have inner chambers enshrining gigantic
statues of Buddha, with corridors around the chambers, quite comparable to the aisles of English
or French cathedrals. But the greatest of all the Burmese pagodas, the Shwe Dagon of Rangoon,
is a solid mass of brick, with no interior cell, yet enormous in size, erected on a broad platform
one hundred and sixty-six feet from the ground, towering to an additional height of two hundred
and seventy feet, and crowned with a jewelled "umbrella" at the total elevation of four hundred
and thirty-six feet above the teeming streets of the city below. The main platform from which
the pagoda proper rises is an immense court nine hundred feet long by six hundred and eighty-five
feet wide, and crowded with minor pagodas and shrines. This great esplanade is approached from
the four points of the compass by long covered arcades, lined with shops in which offerings
of every description can be bought. On the marble floor of the main court and before the minor
shrines these offerings are presented by scores of worshipers prostrating themselves before
statues of Buddha of every size. And yet the great conical or bell-shaped dome of the pagoda
is its chief attraction, for this is covered with gold-leaf from its base to its summit, and
its shining splendor salutes the traveler from miles and miles away.

This is an atom: 
The religion of Burma is Buddhism. Buddhism is a religion of "merit," so called, and the surest
way to acquire "merit" is by building a pagoda. Repairing an old pagoda will not answer the
purpose; hence many an old pagoda goes to ruin, side by side with a new one coated with whitewash
or gold-leaf. Curiously enough, the epoch of pagoda-building was almost coincident with that
of cathedral-building in England and France, that is, from A. D. 1000 to 1200. When one sees
at Pagan an area along the Irrawaddy River eight miles long and only two miles wide, with nearly
five thousand pagodas, multitudes of them small and in ruins, but many still standing great
and splendid in their proportions, it seems impossible to doubt that a certain genuine religious
impulse, however blind and mistaken, led to their erection. There they stand, mere relics of
a magnificent past, but now erect in the midst of desolation, with only scattered huts about
them, where once there must have been a dense population, rich and lordly. The fate of these
towering monuments of idolatry and superstition, now for the most part given over to the moles
and the bats, shows what God can do for pagodas, and encourages us to believe that missionary
effort will be mighty through God to the pulling down of similar more modern strongholds, together
with all the high things that exalt themselves above the knowledge of his truth.

This is an atom: 
This leads me to speak of the great missionary work that is now honeycombing and undermining
the foundations of heathenism in this pagoda-land. We came to Burma to see what God has wrought.
The labors and sufferings of Adoniram Judson appealed to us even in our childhood. We wished
to see how the mustard-seed which Judson sowed in faith has grown up to bear fruit. So we went
to Aungbinle, where for twenty long months Judson was imprisoned and tortured. There we seemed
to hear God's word to Moses: "Take off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place where thou
standest is holy ground." We were reminded also of the burning bush, which was ever burning
but not consumed. Great forward movements in history are born in suffering. Through death to
life, and the cross before the crown--that was the way of Christ, and it will be the way of
his followers. We gathered, a small group of missionaries and visitors, in the little chapel
that has been built upon the site of that old prison, and we prayed, with a lot of dusky villagers
and children before us, that God would yet more gloriously prosper the work of missions.

This is an atom: 
We had every advantage in our investigations in Burma. Thirteen of my former pupils are now
missionaries in that land. For many years they have been inviting me to visit them. Nine missionaries
met us at the dock, as we landed from Singapore and Penang. They have made our visit delightful
by their affectionate and boundless hospitality. Morning, noon, and night have been full of
sightseeing, of visiting mission churches and schools, of "chotas," or little breakfasts, of
"tiffins" or substantial lunches, or afternoon-teas and dinners at the close of the day. The
social and kindly spirit of it all has turned what otherwise would have been wearisome into
a succession of pleasant experiences. But there has been work, and there has been hard thinking
also. Making three addresses a day, longer or shorter, for three weeks in succession, is no
sinecure. I am sometimes called an "octogeranium," but I have not been permitted to waste my
sweetness on the desert air. It is a wonder to me that I have survived so much stress and rushing,
but I am compelled to say that good appetite and good sleep have made me feel in better health
and spirits than for many months before.

This is an atom: 
What I have seen has gladdened my eyes and warmed my heart. Closer contact with mission work
and mission workers has broadened my ideas, given me more sympathy, more zeal, and more hope.
The vastness of these heathen populations, their appalling needs, together with their infinite
possibilities, have dawned upon me as never before. Burma has sixty millions of people. It
is a most fruitful land, never visited by the famines which ravage India proper, the land west
of the Bay of Bengal. It enshrines a religion which, with all its ignorance and superstition,
is more free from gross immorality than that which prevails on the other side of the bay. Its
people are the most heterogeneous of any upon earth. Though the proud Burman native is still
the dominant power, he has now to compete with the rising intelligence of the Karens, the sturdiness
of the Chinese, and the subtlety of the Hindus. These last two peoples have in late years in
large numbers migrated hither. Mohammedan mosques are rising side by side with the older Buddhist
pagodas. The Parsees are numerous and influential, and theosophists are not rare. Rangoon is
probably the capital city of Buddhism, for here at any rate is its most splendid temple. And
Rangoon is a sort of melting-pot of all races. Burmans and Chinese are intermarrying, and are
producing a most vigorous offspring. Sikhs and Malays, by their peculiar dress, make picturesque
the streets. I know of no greater mixture of races, unless it is in the city of New York, where
we have more Jews than there are in Jerusalem, and more Italians than there are in Rome. Here
in Rangoon, however, all these peoples preserve their distinctive characteristics of dress
and language, so that racial differences are more apparent.

The Roman Catholics and the representatives of the Church of England have made great efforts
to capture Burma. They have established noble plants in the way of church edifices, hospitals,
and schools. The leper asylum of the Romanists is an impressive and worthy provision for the
housing and treatment of hundreds thus afflicted. The cathedral and school of the Anglican
Church show a most praiseworthy estimate of the needs of this great province of the British
Empire, and breakfasting with Bishop Fyffe, the metropolitan of Rangoon, gave us a pleasing
impression of his kindly Christian spirit. The Methodist Episcopal Church has also its representative
here, and all of these evangelizing agencies are supplemented by the work of the Y. M. C. A.,
the Y. W. C. A., and the Salvation Army. Yet it is not too much to say that the Baptists have
first place in Burma, both in church-membership and in education. We were the first Christian
denomination upon the ground; we have leavened the country with our influence; our Mission
Press has furnished the Bible in several different languages to the people of Burma; our schools
are the most advanced in grade and the most numerously attended; our churches are most nearly
self-governing and self-supporting. We have great reason to thank God and take courage.

This is an atom: 
All this is the growth of a single century. It was in the year 1813 that the Judsons arrived
in Burma, and it was six years after that the first Burman convert was baptized. In 1828 the
first Karen convert followed Christ. These two were the first-fruits from the two leading races
of Burma. Since their baptism there has sprung up a flourishing Christian community which embraces
representatives both of the indigenous races of Burma and of the immigrant peoples from India
proper, from China, and from other lands. The Baptist churches in Burma to-day, as their official
representatives inform us, enroll members gathered from eighteen different nationalities, besides
members of the Anglo-Indian or Eurasian type. "The entire Christian community in Burma, according
to the Government Census of 1911, numbers 210,081; of which number, 122,265 are Baptists, while
60,088 are Roman Catholics, 20,784 are Anglicans, 1,675 are Methodists, and the remainder are
distributed among smaller sects. That one Protestant convert of 1819 has become an army of
one hundred and fifty thousand."

This is an atom: 
We must add to this numerical statement the facts that a corps of Christian leaders has been
trained and put into service; that native Christians have found their way into influential
positions as magistrates, township officers, teachers of schools, inspectors of police, and
clerks in all departments of the government. Christian men are prominent in business and professional
circles, as traders, contractors, brokers, physicians, lawyers; and the Christian character
is everywhere recognized and honored. A church, to a large degree self-propagating, has been
planted in Burma. A complete system of missionary education has been organized. Modern philanthropic
work for the relief and prevention of physical ills has been transplanted to Burma. The Sunday
School, the Christian Endeavor Society, the temperance movement, are common methods of Karen
and of Burmese church activity. An extensive Christian literature has been provided, in addition
to the printing of the Bible in all the main languages of the country. In fact, a Home Mission
Society, for the evangelization of the natives in the remoter sections of the country, is in
active operation. When we remember that all this is the product of a hundred years, in a land
where only a little while ago Christianity was a persecuted religion, we praise God for the result.

This is an atom: 
I must mention two features of my visit which claim special attention. I refer to the work
of the collegiate and other schools, and to the hospitality of non-Christian gentlemen. We
have inaugurated in Burma a graded system of education, under government inspection, and leading
to full university training. Nothing in my travels interested me more than to see hundreds
of boys and girls of Burmese and Karen families, in which girls have hitherto been unable to
read or write, singing Christian hymns from books with the music and words before them. The
great need of France, as the Emperor Napoleon once said, was good mothers. It is equally true
of Burma, and little children carry back into idolatrous homes their love for Christ, and their
juvenile protest against heathenism. I addressed several audiences of a thousand each, where
the full half were girls and women, no longer secluded and ignorant, but prepared to assume
responsibility as the mothers and trainers of a new race of Burmans. In these schools, exclusive
of the seminaries and Bible schools, there are enrolled more than 30,000 pupils, who pay annual
tuition fees of more than $80,000. The Morton Lane School at Maulmain, the Eurasian School
at the same place, the Kemendine School in Rangoon, the Girls' School at Mandalay, have each
of them about three hundred scholars, and they are sending out influences which will in a few
years revolutionize the civilization and the religion of Burma. Other schools of not so high
a grade are doing equally faithful work. Our Baptist College at Rangoon is caring for the higher
grades of education, and is preparing hundreds of young men for teaching and for government
service. It was inspiring to address a thousand of its scholars, under the direction of Principal
David Gilmore, D. D., formerly of Rochester. The endowment of such an institution in this heathen
land would be an achievement worthy of some Christian millionaire in America. And the same
thing may be said for our Burman Theological Seminary at Insein under Dr. John McGuire, and
our Karen Theological Seminary under Dr. W. F. Thomas.

This is an atom: 
That walls of partition are breaking down under the influence of Christianity, was made plain
to us by invitations to take breakfast with a noted Parsee barrister, and to take afternoon-tea
with a wealthy Mohammedan gentleman, both of them citizens of Rangoon. The courtesy and intelligence
of these hosts of ours will always be a delightful memory, while their novel and beautiful
homes revealed to us what art and nature can do when united in other than Christian surroundings.
Our Parsee barrister had obtained his education largely in England, and the Mohammedan gentleman
had enjoyed intercourse with the best of our American missionaries. The Moslem friend still
maintained a sort of seclusion for his wife, and only the ladies of our party visited her in
her private apartments. But when we rose to depart, he surprised us all by asking that we offer
prayer, and he endorsed the prayer that was offered by uttering a hearty "Amen." As we stood
ready to go, it was easy to pray for a blessing upon the house and the family which we were
leaving behind us. Respect for Christianity, and a conviction that Christian education is the
great need of the future, are already permeating the higher classes of Burman society.

This is an atom: 
The climax of our stay in Burma was reached when Lord Chelmsford, the viceroy of India, visited
Rangoon, and the lieutenant governor invited us to an afternoon-tea in his honor. The pandal,
or reception pavilion, erected at the dock where the viceroy landed and where he was received
with a salute of thirty-one guns, had been filled that morning by the élite of Burman society,
fifteen hundred in number, and the address of welcome had drawn from the viceroy a fitting
response. All Rangoon was a wonder of decoration. Arches with Saracenic domes built by the
Moslems, pagodalike structures built by the Buddhists, Parsee towers, and Hindu temples, appeared
at many street-crossings, and one long avenue was lined on either side with elevated rows of
benches upon which were seated thousands of children from the schools. The viceroy passed in
triumphal procession between files of soldiery, with cavalry for a body-guard and a dense mass
of humanity thronging the sidewalks, looking on and cheering. At night, the streets and public
buildings were brilliantly illuminated, and the great pagodas glittered like gems from top
to bottom, encircled with rings of electric lights.

This is an atom: 
We reached the Government House, the scene of the afternoon lawn-tea, through clouds of dust
raised by four lines of vehicles that struggled for precedence. At last we emerged in the grounds
before the stately edifice where the lieutenant governor resides, and we were presented to
Lord and Lady Chelmsford. The viceroy and his wife were simple and gracious in manner, and
they made us feel that we were conferring as well as receiving honor. A group of forty dancing-girls,
in antique Burmese costumes, were giving a performance on one part of the emerald lawn, while
on another white-robed servants were setting before the guests all manner of refreshments.
So, amid music and feasting, the day ended. With the oncoming darkness the viceroy and his
lady retired to their apartments in the great government residence, and at the same time the
whole company joined in singing "God Save the King!" It was a striking close to our experiences
in Burma, for fully half of the guests that day were Hindus and Mohammedans, each one of them
arrayed in gorgeous garments and decorated with jewels. It left in our minds the fixed impression
that the hold of Great Britain upon Burma and indeed upon all India is largely due to the Christian
character of British rule, and that missionary work of evangelization and of education is to
be given large credit for India's present universal loyalty to the British Crown.

This is an atom: 
This chapter would not be complete without special mention of the dinner of our Rochester men.
We number thirteen of them in Burma, and they fill very important places in the work of missions.
Two are graduates of our university, but not of our seminary--Mr. F. D. Phinney, the superintendent
of our Mission Press, and Dr. David Gilmore, the acting principal of our Baptist College. With
the wives who graced the company, seventeen persons sat down at table. Singiser presided; McGuire
gave us welcome; Dudley, Cochrane, Rogers, Hattersley, Crawford, added spice to the occasion.
The rewards of a teacher sometimes come late, but they are very sure. When I saw that gathering
of missionary workers, and remembered Geis, Cope, and Streeter, who were prevented from coming,
I felt that my labor had not been in vain in the Lord, since Burma is being transformed by
Rochester.

This is an atom: 
And I shall never forget a final reception given us at an afternoon-tea by Dr. D. W. A. Smith,
the president emeritus of the Karen Theological Seminary at Insein, and by his estimable wife,
to whom I had had the privilege of presenting a memorial album, on behalf of all the teachers
and missionaries, on the occasion of her seventy-sixth birthday. Doctor Smith and Mrs. Smith
are honored and beloved by all who know them. Like myself, he has served the cause of theological
education for forty years, and has now retired for partial rest. I am glad that my name can
be in any way connected with his, for I am sure that his works will follow him.

MANDALAY AND GAUHATI

This is an atom: 
These two places are types of two different religions, the Buddhist and the Hindu. Mandalay
in Burma is the representative of Buddhism; Gauhati in Assam illustrates Hinduism. The hill
of Mandalay is crowned by a pagoda so unique and splendid that it draws pilgrims from every
part of Burma; the hill at Gauhati is similarly attractive in Assam. I have thought that a
description of the two, and of the worship at each of them, might serve to fix in memory the
differences between these leading religions of the British Empire in India.

This is an atom: 
Mandalay was the terminus of our third excursion into the more remote parts of Burma. From
Rangoon as a center of operations, we went first to Bassein, where our Burman and our Karen
schools for boys and girls are beautifully located. Bassein is one hundred and ninety-two miles
west of Rangoon. Maulmain, our second object of interest and visitation, is one hundred and
seventy-one miles distant from Rangoon on the south and east. Here our great missionary, Adoniram
Judson, began his work, and here are two of our chief schools for girls.

This is an atom: 
Mandalay is farther removed from Rangoon than are either Bassein or Maulmain. It lies three
hundred and eighty-six miles to the north. It was a former capital of Burma. It contains the
palace of King Thebaw, the foundations of which are reputed to have been laid upon human sacrifices,
and from which the king was driven after a long and fierce British assault. Ancient tradition
decreed that only sacred edifices should be built of brick. Thebaw's palace is therefore of
wood, though it is gorgeous with carving and gilt. Surrounded by a wide and deep moat, there
is a walled enclosure of more than a mile square, whose gateways are picturesque in the extreme,
and which to all but modern cannon would be an impregnable fortress.

This is an atom: 
But it is the Hill of Mandalay that most excites the traveler's wonder and admiration. Upon
its summit, commanding a far-reaching view of the winding river and of endless paddy-fields,
with mountains in the distance, stands a pagoda which is in many respects more remarkable than
the great Shwe Dagon pagoda at Rangoon. This one at Mandalay might indeed be called four separate
pagodas, on successive heights, and connected with one another by a straight stairway in part
hewn out of the solid rock and in part built of masonry. The stairway consists of eight hundred
and twenty-two steps, in four different series, each series leading to a broad open platform
on which rises a separate temple with a colossal image of Buddha in its center.

This is an atom: 
From below, this long stairway, with its railing of brick or concrete and its quartet of gilded
pagodas shining in the sun, is a picturesque and unique object. The crowning pagoda seems almost
impossible of access. It is set upon such a height, however, for the purpose of making the
ascent to the altar difficult, and so of adding to the "merit" of its worshipers. The stairway,
even when cut in the rock, has often forty or fifty steps so narrow, that the ascent from platform
to platform is actually precipitous. The entire series of steps, from the bottom of the hill
to the top, is roofed over with sheets of corrugated iron, until the whole looks like a covered
way to the clouds. Going up seemed an exciting adventure. My physician had forbidden my climbing,
and my wife declared that she could not attempt the walk. The problem became serious.

This is an atom: 
The difficulty was removed by bringing from the missionary's house two solid teak-wood armchairs,
to serve us after the sedan fashion. Long poles of bamboo were lashed underneath them, and,
after we had seated ourselves, eight men, four for each chair, lifted these poles, with their
superimposed American pilgrims, upon their shoulders. Then began a triumphal march, which at
every step of the ascent threatened to become a funeral march. The bearers all had bare feet,
feet twice as long as the steps were broad, so that they practically went upward on their toes.
A single misstep would have caused disaster--nothing less than an avalanche of coolies, chairs,
and pilgrims. But my secretary guarded me, the missionary guarded my wife, and we went up in
safety.

This is an atom: 
Going upward some two hundred steps, we rested upon a platform with a pagoda which enshrined
the statue of a Buddha perhaps twenty feet in height and covered with gold-leaf from top to
toe. Any worshiper can prove his faith by clapping a bit of gold-leaf upon the statue. The
result is that the hands and feet of Buddha are thick with encrusted gold. He holds out his
hands in seeming invitation. Two hundred feet more brought us to a second platform and a second
pagoda in which Buddha also appears; but now he is in the attitude of teaching. Still another
ascent, and we come to a pagoda in which Buddha stands, a towering form fifty feet in height,
with his finger extended in expectation toward the plain. And a final ascent brings us to a
colossal Buddha, now reclining, as if his work were done and he were entering upon the bliss
of Nirvana. At this last stage there is also a series of waxwork figures which symbolize the
vanity of life and of human desire. Four forms represent, first, the babe at its mother's breast;
secondly, the youth full of vigor; then the older man haggard with care; and finally, the corpse,
upon whose vitals the birds of the air are preying.

This is an atom: 
From the summit of this Mandalay Hill, another pagoda, almost as famous, is to be seen. I mean
the Kuthodaw, in the plain below. This is four hundred and fifty pagodas in one, all but one
of them little edifices, each with a small sitting statue of Buddha within it. An even more
remarkable thing is that each of these diminutive pagodas has also within it a portion of the
Buddhist scriptures, engraved upon a solid block of stone, and all of these together make up
the Tripitaka, upon which the Buddhist pins his faith. In the center of the grand enclosure
stands a beautiful white pagoda, with wreaths of gold about its graceful spire. The long rows
of little temples, with their attempt to preserve the holy book in an enduring form, are a
monument to the faith of King Thebaw's uncle who planned it. Few people, however, read the
writing upon the stones. For any practical result it is necessary to have the law of the Lord
written upon the tables of the heart.

This is an atom: 
The descent from Mandalay Hill was even more hazardous than the ascent, for we were in continual
danger of slipping from our chairs and knocking over the bearers. We were profoundly grateful
when we reached the level ground again and found that we had survived. Our experiences with
Buddhism were instructive. The saffron robes of the omnipresent priests and monks undoubtedly
cover much laziness and much willingness to depend for a living upon others. But every Burman
boy expects to spend some time, though it may be only a week or a month, in a monastery. There
he usually learns to read, though his main work is that of memorizing certain portions of the
Buddhist scriptures. So far as I have been able to learn, there are no positive immoralities
connected with Buddhistic worship. The example of Buddha has in it some worthy elements, such
as the renunciation of earthly and sensual ambitions. But Buddhism, for all that, is a pessimistic
religion. It denies to man the existence of a soul, and it gives him no hope for anything but
practical extinction. Buddha no longer lives to help his worshipers. In the struggle with sin,
there is no atonement for the transgressions of the past, and no prospect of perfection in
the future. Hence the preaching of Christ, crucified for our sins and ever present with his
people, is to the Buddhist a revelation so novel and so entrancing, that it captivates and
transforms him. Christianity humbles pride, but it saves the soul. It shows the impossibility
of obtaining salvation by merit of our own, and our absolute dependence upon the grace of God.
Christianity awakens gratitude, and leads to unselfish devotion. It turns a Saul into a Paul,
and makes him a missionary and a hero.

This is an atom: 
Gauhati is the present capital of Assam, as Mandalay was once the capital of Burma. Like Burma,
Assam is overrun by Hindus, who seek employment in the tea-plantations and in every other species
of labor. These Hindus have brought their religion with them, and in Assam the animistic religions
of the natives very commonly give way to the more poetic and philosophic faith of the Hindus.
In Gauhati the Hindus have established a temple which attracts thousands of pilgrim worshipers
from all parts of Assam and indeed of India, as the pagoda of Mandalay attracts pilgrims from
all parts of Burma. The Gauhati temple, like that at Mandalay, is set upon a beautiful hill
not far from the town, approached only by a long and stony climb, though with many a rest-house
on the way. This temple and its worship so illustrate Hinduism, that a slight account of its
origin and beliefs seems to be necessary.

This is an atom: 
The god Siva had a goddess for a wife. Displeased with her unfaithfulness, he seized her, and
with her as his captive he flew through the air, and as he flew, he cut her in pieces. The
middle portion of her body fell to the earth on this hill, and consecrated forever this spot
near Gauhati. In the temple and grove of this hill the goddess is worshiped by such rites as
will please one of low and licentious tastes. In fact, the rites of this temple are said to
be the most obscene of any in the British possessions. There are reputed to be a thousand "virgins,"
who subsist in and upon the temple. The extent to which they are virgins may be judged by the
number of fatherless children clinging to their robes or carried about. These "virgins," as
is well known, are "married to the god of the temple"--which may mean married either to the
priests of the temple, or to the worshipers of the temple. I asked a missionary whether these
"virgins," after their term of service, could contract an ordinary marriage. I was answered
that the girls were "married to the temple for life." One of these unfortunate women led by
the hand a beautiful little daughter. On being asked who the father was, the mother replied:
"How should I know? I am a temple-woman." So the gratification of illicit passion becomes a
religious act. The residents of Gauhati are free to visit the temple, and so, alas! are the
eight hundred students of the English college only two miles away. Who can measure the corrupting
influence of this temple upon the lives of the people over a wide area in Assam?

This is an atom: 
A student of the college, who was also a priest of the temple, met one of our party on his
visit. This student-priest was a young man of more than ordinary intelligence. He endeavored
to palliate the evil of the temple-worship, and to clothe its acts with spiritual significance.
He pointed to the spot where goats and buffaloes were offered in sacrifice, and he claimed
that this offering was made in expiation of sin. Such an explanation of Hindu sacrifices is
altogether futile. The sense of guilt is so dull in Hinduism, that sin is little more than
external and physical impurity, and may be simply failure to conform to a prescribed act of
ceremonial worship. The true meaning of sacrifice for sin has, in India, been derived solely
from Christian preaching. This particular student had many an opportunity to hear such preaching,
and the knowledge of atonement which he tried to mix with his Hindu theology was probably gained
from missionary sources. It was an illustration of the incidental and indirect ways in which
Christian missions are permeating these Oriental lands, and are forcing these old religions
to adopt some of the fundamental ideas of Christianity. These ideas are misunderstood and misstated,
so that they become in large part forms of error. But notwithstanding, they may pave the way
for a fuller knowledge of the truth, and for the entrance of Christ into the heart and into
the life.

CALCUTTA, DARJEELING, AND BENARES

This is an atom: 
Calcutta is the largest city of India. It numbers more than a million inhabitants, of whom
600,000 are Hindus, 300,000 are Mohammedans, and less than 100,000 are Christians. The name
of the city is derived from Kali, the goddess-wife of Siva, the Destroyer; and her temple is
one of the most filthy and disgusting in all India. In this temple I saw one of its many priestesses
cutting into bits the flesh and entrails of a goat, which had been offered in sacrifice, in
order that the poorest worshiper might have for his farthing something bloody to present at
the altar. It was the altar of a fierce, cruel, and lustful goddess, whose black and ugly image
could be dimly seen within the shrine. A stalwart priest followed me with hand outstretched
for a contribution. It was a novel sensation to hear him utter, in excellent English and with
seeming reverence, the words, "the great goddess Kali," as if no one could doubt her power.
It reminded me of "the great goddess Diana," whom all Asia and the whole world once worshiped,
but whose temple is now an indistinguishable heap of ruins. The worship of a goddess so vengeful
and sensual as Kali throughout India, a worship both of lust and of fear, shows how ineradicable
is the religious instinct, but how perverted it may become when existing apart from divine
revelation.

This is an atom: 
There is another temple in Calcutta of a somewhat better sort. I refer to the temple of the
Jains, that mongrel sect which is partly a reformed Hinduism, and partly a worship of Buddha.
Its temple is a model of cleanliness and of Oriental art. Its decoration consists largely of
inlaid glass of all the colors of the rainbow. Walls, ceilings, and columns are fairly ablaze
with tinted arabesques that reflect every ray of the sun. Fountains and lawns and statues mingle
their attractions. The effect is one of splendor and beauty. Jainism is conservative Hinduism,
recurring to the ancestral worship of the Vedas, exaggerating its doctrine of the sanctity
of animal life, repudiating its later licentious developments, and taking in Buddha, not as
the supreme and sole teacher of religion, but as only one of its great saints and heroes.

This is an atom: 
The real glory of Calcutta is its relation to modern missions. Here is the chapel in which
William Carey preached, and in which Adoniram Judson was baptized. Its spacious construction
evinces the faith and hope of its founders. But it is in Serampore, which, though fourteen
miles away, is almost a suburb of Calcutta, that Carey's work was done. How wonderful that
work was! "A consecrated cobbler," he mastered the languages of the Orient, and gave the Bible
to India in several of its tongues. He received from the British Government large compensation
for his services as interpreter and translator, but he gave back all the money he received,
in order to support schools and missions. The noble college at Serampore, with its hundreds
of students, is his best memorial. His tomb in the cemetery witnesses to his humility of spirit.
It stands at one corner of a triangle, with the tombs of Marshman and of Ward at the two remaining
corners, but the only inscription he permitted to be engraved upon it is the two lines of the hymn,

From Calcutta we traveled about three hundred and seventy miles northward to Darjeeling. We
wished to see the Himalayas. A most tortuous narrow-gage railway lifted us gradually to a height
of seven thousand feet. And there we had the unusual privilege of seeing the sunrise tipping
with rosy light the snowy peak of Kinchinjinga, twenty-eight thousand feet high and forty-six
miles away. Mt. Everest, a hundred miles distant, is twenty-nine thousand feet high, but from
Darjeeling is invisible. Kinchinjinga is nearly twice as high as Mont Blanc, and its glittering
mass is a spectacle never to be forgotten. Curiously enough, upon the summit of Observatory
Hill, from which we gained our view, the immigrant Tibetans had erected their shrine, and long,
inscribed paper and muslin streamers, enclosing a large quadrangle, gave to the winds their
prayers. No idol was to be seen. The worship seems to be far more spiritual than that of the
Hindus. Nature seems to have taught that secluded race of Tibetans a more primitive religion
than modern Hinduism. It is a religion mixed with Buddhism, but preserving the earlier view
of a divinity in natural objects, which Hinduism has almost wholly outgrown.

This is an atom: 
Our next point of investigation was Benares, "the holy city," the Mecca and Jerusalem of the
Hindus. It is a hotbed of heathen enthusiasm and of blinded devotion. The sacred river Ganges
flows by, with tier upon tier of temples rising from its steep banks--such a congestion of
religious edifices that one might almost doubt whether they had left room for any but priests
to live. Every day, hundreds of pilgrims troop through its streets and throng these temples,
presenting their flowers and their offerings, making their sacrifices, and listening submissively
to the instructions and threatenings of the priests. Every temple has its sacred animals, to
be sacrificed or worshiped. The "Golden Temple," so-named, is covered with gold-leaf from its
spire to its base. The noisy crowd in its corridors, the noisome odors of its sanctuaries,
the adjurations of its priests and their evident aim to turn religion into financial gain,
disgust the Christian traveler, while they show him how deeply rooted in the human heart is
this towering system of idolatry and superstition.

This is an atom: 
But only the water-view of Benares presents Hinduism in its most characteristic aspect. It
is the sacred river that makes sacred the town. This river is regarded as itself divine, for
it had its source in the mouth of Brahma. Hence it is endowed with life-giving and purifying
powers. It is bordered for a full mile by a grand succession of palaces and temples, of bathing
ghats and of burning ghats. Here the Hindu, often after long pilgrimage, washes away his defilement
and prepares himself to die. When death actually comes, his relatives wash his body in the
holy stream. But the bathing ghat only makes ready for the burning ghat. These burning ghats
are castle-like edifices, from which the smoke of burning flesh ascends continually. Cremation,
with the Hindu, takes the place of burial. The ashes are collected and are preserved in a tomb.
To die in Benares, and to have a temple for a tomb, is the surest passport to happiness in
a future state, since the transmigration of souls into higher or lower forms is an essential
doctrine of modern Hinduism.

This is an atom: 
A wealthy resident of Benares courteously offered us the use of his observation-boat to view
the scene upon the river in the early morning. This river-craft was a double-decker, propelled
by oars from the lower deck. From the upper platform, one could overlook the ceremonial washings
of hundreds of pilgrims. Stalwart men plunged themselves three times into the stream, looked
toward the sun, joined their hands, spoke a prayer, rinsed their sacred cord, cleansed their
raiment, and then, reclad, went to the priest on his platform, to be smeared with ashes on
the forehead and marked with a little colored dot, as a certificate that they had correctly
performed their vow. Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, had each his worshipers and his priests, to
give the appropriate mark. The "holy man" was there, either upon his bed of spikes or in an
attitude which suggested torture, and ready to receive the homage, and the money as well, of
his benighted admirers. Mothers were present, immersing not only themselves but also their
children. All the bathers must drink of the muddy and fetid water, for purification internal
is as needful as purification external. And so, hundreds of worshipers every day, and on special
feast-days thousands, drink this water of the "sacred Ganges," foul with the stains of disease
and reeking with the sweat of the dead. It is no wonder that the burning ghats have no lack
of business, and no wonder that medical experts have traced epidemics of cholera, smallpox,
and plague, in Western lands, to this city of Benares, where "Satan's seat is." The throne
of the great adversary, however, seems to be built on very insufficient foundations, for not
a few of the temples which line the steep banks of the river have toppled over, or have sunk
into the yielding sand. Their massive fragments, at the base of long stairways of stone, show
how hideous is the ruin of any system of religion which is not founded upon Christ, the Rock.

LUCKNOW, AGRA, AND DELHI

This is an atom: 
At last we are on Mohammedan ground--at least on ground where Mohammedanism has a powerful,
and perhaps a controlling, influence. This northwest part of India was the scene of Moslem
conquest in the ninth century. Mohammedans have always proudly contemned idolatry, and they
have often been iconoclasts, as many headless Hindu images can witness. Northwest India saw
the rise and the strength of the great mutiny of half a century ago, but it was Moslem rajas
and faithful Moslem troops who helped to put it down.

This is an atom: 
Mohammedan faith in the unity and personality of God might at first sight seem to render its
adherents more accessible than are Hindus to the gospel of Christ. As a matter of fact, however,
the very elements of truth in their belief make them too often stout opponents of Christianity.
They are religious bigots, as the Hindus are not. The Hindu has a pantheon to which he can,
with some show of consistency, invite Christ. The Mohammedan declares that there is but one
God, and that Mohammed is his prophet. So he denies Christ's claim to be either God or Saviour.

This is an atom: 
Lucknow was deeply interesting, for here was exhibited one of the most heroic and thrilling
defenses ever made in history. More than two hundred women and children spent three months
of agony in the cellars of the British residency, while husbands and fathers and friends, to
the number of seventeen hundred, were exposed to the besieging force and the murderous fire
of fifty thousand mutineers. The headquarters of the defenders were riddled with shot and shell,
and the residency is now a ruin. But only one shot penetrated the retreat of the women and
children below, and of these only one woman lost her life. Crowded together in the heat of
the summer, tormented by flies, half famished for lack of food, these brave women held out
themselves and encouraged the protecting garrison, though of the seventeen hundred men only
seven hundred at the end of the siege remained alive. Sir Henry Lawrence died of a cannon-shot,
exhorting his soldiers to the last man to die, rather than to surrender. We were glad to pay
reverence to his bravery, by a visit to his tomb. Although he died, the flag of England flew
over the fortress, in spite of innumerable efforts of the enemy to bring it down. And to-day,
in memory of that fact, it is the only flag in the British Empire that is not lowered at sunset.
The joy of the defenders and of those whom they defended may be imagined, when General Havelock
appeared in their relief, and the great mutiny was suppressed. That victory settled the prestige
of the English in India. All classes now recognize the military strength as well as the judicial
fairness of British rule. Without it, India would be a country of warring races, for Mohammedan
and Hindu even to-day live in slumbering jealousy of each other.

This is an atom: 
This latent hostility, I am happy to say, shows some signs of wearing away. The desire for
more of home-rule is bringing these two great races together in conventions, with a view to
the discovery of some method of cooperation between them. Parliamentary government in China
and Japan has had its effect in India, and Britain will soon be compelled to admit her Indian
populations to a larger share in municipal and provincial administration. But democracy can
be successful, only when conflicting classes find some basis for harmony. English missionary
and educational institutions are doing much to reconcile Hindus and Mohammedans to one another,
and this may prepare the way, not simply for free government, but also for the acceptance by
both parties of a religion in which all their elements of truth are included, while their perversions
of truth are sloughed off.

This is an atom: 
By English educational and missionary institutions I mean much more than Church of England
schools and colleges. In Lucknow we visited the Isabella Thoburn College, under American Methodist
control, and were greatly impressed by its noble equipment in the way of buildings and teachers.
Both boys and girls have here the opportunity of securing an education as high in grade as
the sophomore years of our American colleges, and of preparing themselves for the advanced
work of a great Indian university. All this is under Christian influences, and has its fruit
in many a conversion to Christ. Martinière College is also nobly equipped and endowed, but
it is solely for English boys, who are generally the sons of British officials in India. I
cannot speak too highly of these means of education now furnished by all our great denominations,
in all the cities of India. I could only wish that our Baptist people at home might see how
far Christians of other names have often surpassed them in their gifts and preparations for
the future of a country whose population is three times as large as our own.

This is an atom: 
At Lucknow we had the rare opportunity of seeing "the mango trick" performed by an expert juggler.
He first showed us a jar, filled with innocent sand, so dry that it fell easily through his
fingers as he lifted a handful. Then he presented a dry mango seed, which he planted in the
sand and watered. The jar was placed on the stone pavement of the hotel, not ten feet away
from our eyes. He covered the jar with a little tent not two feet in diameter. After a few
passes of the hand, the tent was lifted. The seed had already sprouted, and had become a twig
with leaves. Covering the plant once more, he called our attention to a cobra-charmer, who
played harmlessly with a hooded and venomous snake. At last he threw the tent wholly aside,
and there stood a fully developed little mango tree, perhaps two feet high. It seemed impossible
that the folds of the tent, which had been shaken out at the beginning, could possibly have
held it. The juggler's method was simplicity itself. If I had not previously seen in America
a necromancer cut his wife's head off, and then put it on again so slick that she seemed to
have received no injury, I might have begun to believe that this Indian juggler had supernatural
powers.

To Lucknow succeeded Agra. The great wonder and prize of Agra is, of course, the Taj Mahal.
So we made our way to it before sunrise, and saw its exquisite columns and its white minarets
in the rosy light of the earliest morning; then again, as the sun was setting, we saw its last
rays fall upon the snow-white dome. As one looks upon the Taj from the noble gateway through
which one enters the enclosing park, he sees also its reflection in the long lines of water
that lie between, and it seems a miracle of beauty. But when you reach the edifice itself,
and perceive that its simplicity is combined with lavish richness of decoration, marble and
precious stones being so woven together that they form one gorgeous and splendid whole, you
can only admire the affection that planned this memorial to a beloved wife, and the art which
has succeeded in constructing an edifice which, after six centuries, is still recognized as
a wonder of the world. Yet the Moslem emperor who built it was deposed by his son, and then
imprisoned not far away, the chief solace and recreation granted him being this, that from
his prison-roof he could look out upon the Taj Mahal.

This is an atom: 
The Pearl Mosque and the Jasmine Tower, the Courts of Public and of Private Audience, in the
palace which the Moslem emperor once occupied, are monuments of architecture so remarkable
and so beautiful, that no description of mine can fairly represent the impression which they
made upon me. They are surrounded and protected by the Fort, an enclosure half a mile square,
whose massive wall is itself a wonder. In the days when these structures were built, labor
was cheap, for the monarch had only to impress and to feed his laborers. But artistic genius
is always rare. The Mohammedan conquest and sovereignty of the past produced and encouraged
a flowering out of art, comparable to that of the days of cathedral-building in England, and
of the time of Pericles when sculpture and architecture so flourished in Greece. In all the
world there is nothing more elaborate or beautiful than the perforated marble of these Oriental
screens, and the intricate carving of these Oriental pillars. The Alhambra in Spain has its
superiors in India, both for splendor of color and for beauty of pattern. The arabesques of
these Oriental mosques exhibit powers of invention of the highest order. It has been well said
that their architects "designed like Titans, and finished like jewelers." Both the throne of
the Mogul Emperor Akbar and his tomb in Agra are proofs that even the grain of truth in Mohammedanism
can awaken intelligence and enthusiasm in those who receive it, and that, in the conflict with
idol systems, it has power to conquer the world.

This is an atom: 
An account of our visit to Delhi may well complete my summary of Mohammedan influences in India.
Delhi was the capital of India long before Akbar reigned and the lofty tower of the Kutab Minar
was built. But Hindu influence has combined with Mohammedan in leading the British to restore
Delhi to its former position as the center of governmental authority. Tradition has handed
down a prediction that making Delhi its capital marked the end of each power that asserted
itself. Hence there have been many Delhis, as there have been many ancient Romes, and this
present Delhi must be succeeded by a new Delhi which British authority and resources will build.
The new Delhi will be the ninth, as the present Delhi is the eighth, of the long series. Ruins
of the earlier Delhis are about it on every side. Now, at last, a great tract of land has been
appropriated for the new seat of government which will rise from the dust. Temporary buildings
have been erected. The permanent ones will soon follow. We may be sure that they will be splendid
and suited to modern tastes, while they still preserve the characteristic features of Indian
architecture.

This is an atom: 
By making this new Delhi the British capital of India, it is sought to impress the Oriental
mind with Britain's claims to be supreme, while at the same time the old traditional prediction
is evaded. Let us hope that the device will accomplish its purpose. The prosperity of India
is bound up with the recognition by all races and parties of England's right to rule. I would
not justify all the steps by which Britain has gained her power, nor would I ignore certain
defects of her later administration. But there is no question as to the general justice of
British rule, nor as to the fact that, without it, India's warring races and religions would
now be the ruin of all peace and progress. When we remember that in this land of former famines
the population has increased since 1858 by one hundred millions; that forty-six thousand miles
of canals have been dug for irrigation, and more than twenty-two million acres have thereby
been reclaimed; that trade has increased in the last half-century from three hundred millions
to fourteen hundred millions; that the value of land is now larger by fifteen hundred millions
than it was fifty years ago; that there are now thirty-two thousand miles of railway in operation
and seventy-six thousand miles of telegraph; that the Indian Post Office now handles nine hundred
millions of letters, newspapers, and other matter every year; we may well doubt whether any
conquest of history has brought about so great or so beneficent results as have followed what
we must regard as England's commercial absorption of India.

This is an atom: 
There are doubtless seditious and anarchistic elements in the Indian populations which need
to be kept under and subdued. Let us remember that only one-tenth part of the men, and only
one-hundredth part of the women, know how to read. There is a vast proletarian mass, ignorant
and inflammable, ready to follow leaders of better education, but less principle, than themselves.
This mass the British Government has failed to educate, so that, while ninety per cent of the
people in Japan can read, in India only one-tenth as many can read. One of the greatest mistakes
of English administration has been its beginning of education at the top, instead of at the
bottom. It has established universities, but not elementary schools. The excuse, of course,
has been, that differences of caste and of religion have made it impossible to put Hindu children
and Mohammedan children, Brahman children and Sudra children, together, in the same schools.
And yet, in the universities, pupils of all these various classes sit side by side, and some
plan, it would seem, might have been devised to apply the same rule, so as to secure universal
and compulsory elementary education. The higher education, taken alone, has its dangers; it
is sought only by people of means and intelligence; many seek it from no love of learning,
but only in order to prepare themselves for government offices. But there are not enough offices
to go round. The disappointed men will not work with their hands; they find their avocation
in the plotting of sedition. It is the high-caste educated Brahmans who have edited the malcontent
periodicals, and have organized the revolutionary conspiracies, which have of late bred so
much trouble for the government in India. I rejoice therefore in the rise of factories, and
in the new emphasis that is being laid on industrial education. These will do much to develop
the resources of India. But what is most needed is the spirit of peace and justice; this is
furnished by the gospel of Christ. I therefore believe that the gospel is the only real guaranty
to India of its political as well as its religious welfare.

This is an atom: 
The Friday prayer-service in the great mosque of Delhi was a striking spectacle. The open court
in front of the mosque is four hundred and fifty feet square, surrounded by a cloister, and
paved with granite inlaid with marble. Three or four thousand worshipers, in parallel rows,
stretched from side to side of the great enclosure. At the summons of the mollah, or officiating
priest, all these worshipers, in perfect unison, prostrated themselves with folded hands, and
repeated in a loud voice, "God is great." Each devotee had previously purified himself, by
cleansing his mouth and hands and feet in the open tank in the center of the great esplanade.
Inasmuch as the Delhi mosque is the largest and most splendid east of Cairo, the entire spectacle
was most impressive.

This is an atom: 
If Turkey had not joined a Christian power by her alliance with Germany, Mohammedans throughout
the world might have taken Germany's side against the Allies, and might have threatened the
peace of India. That danger is now providentially averted. The Moslem rulers have held fast
to their allegiance to the British Crown. This city of Delhi, with the schools of the Methodists,
the Anglicans, and the English Baptists, is permeated with religious influences that attract
its native populations, and these influences are continually lessening the prospect of any
future rebellion such as the mutiny of fifty years ago.

This is an atom: 
JAIPUR, MT. ABU, AND AHMEDABAD

This is an atom: 
India, as is well known, is a part of the British Empire, and is under the sway of the British
Government. Yet, for administrative purposes, it is divided into presidencies, provinces, and
native states. The presidencies and provinces are wholly administered by British officials.
The native states are administered by rajas and other Indian rulers, with the presence in each
capital of a resident officer who represents the British Government and who is accessible for
consultation in case of necessity. The relations between the rajas and the residents are friendly,
and only the gravest matters are referred to the representative of the Crown. All other affairs
are cared for by the native ruler, who is attended by a distinguished suite and who maintains
quite a royal court. This species of self-government is the reward, granted by the British
Government after the mutiny of 1857, to the rulers of the native states, who remained faithful
to British interests and assisted in the suppression of the great rebellion. The government
of these native rulers is in general worthy of praise. Many of them are progressive men; they
have traveled abroad; they have been affected by Western thought; they have introduced modern
reforms and systems of education, to the great benefit of their subjects. In this present hour
of crisis, the majority of them have been loyal to the British Government, and have contributed
men and means for the cause of the Allies. It was interesting in our journey across India to
traverse several of these native states; and it was difficult to observe any difference between
these sections and the portions of the empire officered solely by the British. We saw no British
soldiers, but only native troops. There was less of English language and custom prevalent.
The Hindu, Mohammedan, and Jain seemed to have things very much to themselves. They, after
all, are the real India, the hereditary India, while at the same time they are feeling the
influence of modern railways and modern commerce.

This is an atom: 
Jaipur, which is the capital of a native state, was especially interesting. It has been called
"The Pink City," either because the maharaja owns all the property on the business streets
and himself sees that every building is painted of a pink color, or because he compels every
private owner to conform to his fixed rules of construction and decoration. At any rate, the
wide streets of Jaipur are laid out like those of the homeland, and are lined with pink structures
of only one type of architecture and only one type of ornamentation. Even Paris can present
no better illustration of the value of supervision in building. There are no sky-scrapers.
There are long rows of shops and residences, with arcades in front of them, and with many variations
in plan and decoration, while at the same time one tone of pink, together with the sky-line
and the arcade-line is preserved without important change; the Oriental type of building is
preserved; and there is a uniform style of architecture from one end of the street to the other.
No city in the world so well illustrates Mrs. Humphrey Ward's quotation of the poet's words,

This is an atom: 
A rose-red city, half as old as Time.

This is an atom: 
It is not the city of Jaipur, however, which merits our chief attention, though the maharaja's
town-palace and his quaint astronomical observatory are both of them deeply interesting. This
observatory has no tower and no telescope. It shows what can be done by sun-dials and structures
almost level with the ground to mark the movements of the heavenly bodies, and thus demonstrates
that primitive stargazers might even thus early acquire a very considerable knowledge of astronomy.
The scientific and literary tastes of this Oriental monarch are also indicated by a noble public
library of his own foundation, which contains a priceless collection of books and manuscripts
in all the languages of the East.

This is an atom: 
But it is Amber that constitutes the chief attraction of a visit to Jaipur. Amber is the original
metropolis and the ancient seat of government, five miles distant from the present Jaipur,
and even now the summer residence of the maharaja, though the old city which once lay around
the rocky fortress has become a waste of ruin. The palace at Amber is situated on a hilltop
several hundred feet above the level of the plain, and commanding magnificent views of the
surrounding country. Next to the sight of river or sea from a mountain summit, the view of
broad and level plains stretching far away is most beautiful, and such a view the Indian ruler
secured when he built his summer residence upon this eminence.

This is an atom: 
We came expecting to find India hot, but we have found the northern part of India very cool.
So it was reviving and refreshing to take the drive from Jaipur to Amber in an automobile,
over a noble roadway with slightly ascending grade and skirting an originally splendid palace,
once in the center of an island, but now in the bed of a dried-up lake. When we left the motor-car
at the final lofty hill, the deserted city of Amber towered above us. How should we reach that
threatening height? Three gorgeously caparisoned elephants solicited our patronage for the
ascent. But before making that ascent, there was another ascent to make. We had to ascend the
elephants. Ladders were brought to our assistance, and up the ladders we climbed to the howdah,
or square seat on the top of the bulky beasts. Each elephant had to carry two passengers. I,
on one side of the animal that bore me, had my weight balanced by that of my courier, who rode
on the other side. Each of us was compelled to let his legs dangle over the edge of the howdah.
All went well until the elephant came to the narrow part of the road. There he evinced a vicious
propensity to plant his feet close to the edge of the precipice. There was indeed a railing
beneath me, but, clinging as I was somewhat convulsively to my slippery seat, the railing was
invisible. So I seemed to myself at times to be hanging over the abyss. If I slipped from my
seat, I might fall four hundred feet. It was not a pleasing situation. But the elephant knew
his business. He trod the path in perfect confidence. And so, in royal state, though in mind
tremendously afloat, we made the long and steep climb, until we reached the palace of the king.
The maharaja, however, was not at home that day to receive us. He is a Hindu devotee, and at
the time of our visit he was making a pilgrimage to Benares, the sacred city. The first thing
we saw, when we entered the court of his excellency, was the spot where every morning a bullock
or a goat is sacrificed as an offering to his heathen god.

This is an atom: 
Still, "every prospect pleases." The views of mountain and plain from this elevation among
the hills are so beautiful that one can only admire the taste of the prince who made this his
chosen dwelling-place. And the palace itself is a fascinating study in art and architecture.
Long corridors are turned into cloisters arched and shaded from the sun. Tanks of water, with
fountains playing in the center, provide refreshing baths. Halls of public and of private audience
are gorgeous with crimson and gold. Temples for worship are added, both for daily devotion
and for great state occasions. In short, here are all the appurtenances of an Oriental court,
combined with private luxury and seclusion. While the multitudes must toil and suffer in the
plains below, the maharaja may rest and enjoy himself in his hilltop palace. I would not, however,
imply that this particular monarch is not in many respects a large-minded and liberal man.
The many evidences of his taste and public spirit in Jaipur rectify any wrong impressions one
might gain from a visit to Amber.

This is an atom: 
The next day we reached a station called Abu Road, four hundred miles to the south of Delhi,
and about half-way to Bombay. True to its name, Abu Road furnished us the road to Abu Mountain.
Again we proceeded by motor-car, that great annihilator of distance in a foreign land. This
road, in its gradual ascent, is a noble piece of engineering. It is exceedingly tortuous, for
it follows the contour of the mountain in marvelously skilful curves. All the way for two hours,
and covering an ascent of four thousand five hundred feet, there are enchanting views. Tropical
birds and trees were on every hand, together with cactus of many varieties; green and red parrots
screamed through the air; peacocks spread themselves in the sun; and monkeys scampered across
our path.

This is an atom: 
One of the spurs of Mt. Abu is called Dilwarra. It is the seat of the chief temple in India
of the Jains, that Hindu sect which claims to have preserved the ancient religion of the Vedas,
and to have kept it true to the ancestral faith. As I have before remarked, the Jains aim to
escape the possible miseries of transmigration, and to attain the bliss of Nirvana, even in
the present life. Jainism, like every other heathen system, is an effort to earn salvation
by labors and sacrifices of one's own. Its works of righteousness, however, are often uncalled-for
exaggerations of natural virtues, such as counting sacred all forms of animal and vegetable
life. The most devoted of the sect wear a cloth over their mouths, lest they should destroy
an insect by swallowing it. To found hospitals for the care of parrots and monkeys is one of
the most approved works of merit. So also it is a work of merit to build a temple or to endow
it. Jain temples are full of images, and the chief object of worship is honored by their multiplication.
Buddha is recognized as one of the divine incarnations, and in some sense Buddha is worshiped.
But it must be remembered that even in Jainism Buddha is only a memory. He has entered into
Nirvana, and has passed out of conscious existence. Now that he has attained that state of
passivity, he has no eye to pity and no arm to save. And yet in this Jain temple images of
Buddha are worshiped, and these images are numbered by the hundreds.

This is an atom: 
All this aberration from the truth does not prevent the temple from being almost a miracle
of art. There is a scrupulous cleanliness about it which differences it from other heathen
temples, like that of Kali. In the Jain temples there are no animal sacrifices, for all animal
life is sacred. But there are little houses for feeding the birds; larger houses for feeding
the beasts; and tombs for departed saints and teachers. And let it be specially borne in mind
that in all the world there are no more splendid examples of arches, domes, and shrines, decorated
with elaborate and intricate carvings, than are found here in Dilwarra. Its arabesques of perforated
white marble an inch and a half thick are like lace-work in their delicacy and beauty. Invention
could go no farther in devising an infinite variety of geometric traceries. We in the West
have much to learn from the artistic genius and labor of the East.

This is an atom: 
Another day's ride, or rather, another night's ride, brought us to a city of a very different
sort from Jaipur, and to a very different environment from that of Mt. Abu. It brought us to
the busy metropolis of Ahmedabad. Here is also a city in a state under a native ruler, but
a city so prosperous that native rule is seen to be by no means slovenly or indolent. On the
way from the station I counted eighteen lofty chimneys belonging to manufacturing establishments.
There are eighty factories in this busy center, chiefly connected with the cotton industry.
In this industrial expansion is revealed the solution of many of India's financial problems.
The population is now too exclusively employed in agriculture, and its manufactured articles
are imported. But the rains are so uncertain that the farmer's subsistence is precarious, and
famines claim thousands of victims. Hence, next to Christianity, India needs industrial development.
This has been the view of recent British governors. Better methods of irrigation and of cultivation
have been supplemented by the introduction of new instruments of manufacture. Both English
and American machines now do much of the work that was formerly done by hand, and in the cities
there is growing up a new manufacturing population.

This is an atom: 
Industrial missions are a great blessing to India, and our religious denominations have shown
their practical sense by entering upon this sort of work. When a native becomes a convert to
Christianity, he is often thrown out of caste by his family, and out of labor by his employers.
He must support himself; he must find something to do. But he is friendless and helpless, unless
he can find friendship and help in the mission where he has been converted. It is necessary
to secure employment for him, if he is not to become an encumbrance to the mission and to himself.
Hence I welcome all gifts for industrial missions that will teach men new methods of obtaining
a livelihood. India, as I have said, has a vast agricultural population, now scantily subsisting
and subject to occasional famines. Multitudes who are now idle might be usefully employed.
The change now going on in our Southern States might well go on in Southern India, and I welcome
the sight of the factory chimneys of Ahmedabad.

This is an atom: 
Ahmedabad is not yet converted to Christianity. It is a celebrated stronghold of Jainism, and
here is another most splendid temple. It was instructive to see the little houses on poles
for the care of birds, and for the feeding of lazy monkeys, while the poor and sick of human
kind in the neighborhood begged in vain for help. The Jain temples are noted in all India for
their beauty. Carving and gilding can go no farther than they have gone in the decoration of
this shrine in Ahmedabad. But the troop of monkeys that came to us in the park to be fed, seemed
to us quite as sensitive to human needs as were the holy men who sat about that temple of the
Jains, for these latter devotees use God's gifts not rationally, but for inferior ends, and
especially for their own interest and comfort. Ahmedabad is an example, not of the worst, but
still of a misplaced, religious zeal that has lost its bearings because it has lost its God.

This is an atom: 
BOMBAY, KEDGAON, AND MADRAS

This is an atom: 
Bombay is a great city, the second, in population, of the British Empire in India. While Calcutta
has over a million people, Bombay comes only a few short of that number. Its commerce is immense;
its public buildings are fashioned after European models; its streets are broad and finely
paved; there is every evidence of wealth and cultivation. But Hindus greatly outnumber Mohammedans;
Parsees are strong; Christians are active, but still comparatively few. In thought and customs,
Bombay is still essentially Oriental, while yet profoundly influenced by modern newspapers
and modern inventions. It was a memorable change for us travelers to emerge from its Taj Mahal
Palace Hotel, and then to find ourselves, first in its Caves of Elephanta, and secondly, in
its Towers of Silence.

This is an atom: 
A word of explanation is necessary for each of these notable objects of interest. Elephanta
is a little island eight miles from Bombay, and so named because of its general resemblance
in shape to an elephant. Elephanta Island forms a beautiful object as seen from the deck of
the little steamer that serves for a ferry, and the views from the summit of Elephanta Hill,
over the Bombay Bay, with the gleaming towers of the green city in the distance, are very charming.
The island is a great resort, however, not so much for the views therefrom, as because it is
the seat of a rock-hewn temple excavated centuries ago in honor of Siva, the Hindu god, whose
province it is to destroy. Brahma is the Creator; Vishnu, the Preserver; and Siva, the Destroyer.
Siva was the god of reproduction, however, as well as the god who destroys, and his worship
has been often connected with obscene and lascivious rites.

This is an atom: 
The approach to Siva's temple is through a lovely garden, in which are many splendid specimens
of tropical vegetation. At last there appears to the visitor, in the side of the precipitous
hill, a massive portico, with four immense pillars, all hewn out of the solid rock. Then come
long rows of similar columns leading darkly like a cathedral nave into the stony hill, and
terminating at the altar, above which towers the statue of Siva, colossal in size, with Parvati,
his goddess wife, by his side, and all the emblems of his authority, as scepter and sword,
around him. The statue seems to express the joy of sovereignty, and, though somewhat mutilated,
it is noticeably free from the immoral suggestions which have been intimated in many descriptions
of it. Entrance to the statue is flanked by great guardian statues, and the whole chancel,
so to speak, is enclosed by a broad and lofty corridor, in the manner of cathedral architecture.
From this corridor on either side, many nooks in the rock have been excavated, like chantry
chapels, each with its separate statue at least twenty feet in height. The whole Hindu pantheon,
seems to be represented by carved figures, but all cluster about the god Siva. The really characteristic
and indispensable feature of these caves is, however, still to be mentioned. It is the image
of the lingam, or phallus, gigantic in size, and carven out of solid stone, in the innermost
shrine, where it is the object of hysterical or lustful worship. Every year, on an appointed
feast-day, three or four thousand people throng to this shrine, some to pray for offspring,
others to seek license for illicit pleasure. Elephanta has become in this way the symbol and
propagator of a debasing superstition. Such worship is only a deification of the lower instincts
of human nature.

This is an atom: 
Returning to Bombay, it was natural to think of the Towers of Silence, for these too are located
on a lovely eminence, called the Malabar Hill, and overlooking the city and the bay. These
towers are enclosures in which the Parsees, a most intelligent, wealthy, and influential sect,
dispose of the bodies of their dead, by laying the forms in the open air where they can be
devoured by vultures. The towers themselves are at least half a dozen in number, and they vary
in size. But the style of their construction is uniform. Inside of a lofty circular wall are
concentric beds of stone, each with its groove in which a corpse can be laid. There are three
concentric circles, the outermost for men, the next inner for women, the innermost for children.
The structure has no roof, but is open to the air. Great flocks of vultures perch upon the
top of the outermost enclosing wall, waiting in silence and expectation for the time when they
can descend upon their prey. Only a half-hour elapses after a body is laid on its stony bed,
before these ravenous birds have torn every morsel of flesh from its bones. The skeleton is
then left to disintegrate by the action of the elements, until the rains wash the remaining
dust into a great pit at the center of the circles, from which receptacle the refuse is conducted
away by drains during the rainy season, to mingle with the surrounding earth.

This is an atom: 
This is the Parsees' "ashes to ashes, dust to dust." They glory in this method of disposing
of their dead, and they think it far more natural and impressive than the common Hindu method
of cremation. We must grant that all methods of disposing of the dead are painful. But faith
in a resurrection of the body is surely most in consonance with our time-honored custom of
laying our dead away in their kindred earth, "until the day dawns, and the shadows flee away."

This is an atom: 
From Bombay to the town of Kedgaon may seem to some a descent from great to small. Not so;
it is rather an ascent from the false to the true, from the impure to the pure, from the illusory
to the real. For Kedgaon is the home, and center of the work, of Pundita Ramabai, perhaps the
most learned, and certainly the most influential Christian woman in India. The very name pundita
is given only to those of high intellectual attainments. A Hindu of the highest, that is the
Brahman, caste, she was many years ago converted to Christianity, and she has devoted all her
powers to the education and uplifting of her countrywomen. Her father was a great Sanskrit
scholar. He was one of the first in India to determine that his daughter should be a learned
woman. Accordingly she was thoroughly instructed. She knew by heart the sacred scriptures of
her people long before she became a Christian. She could repeat from memory an amount of them
equal to that of our whole English Bible. It is especially the improvement of the condition
of women, and particularly of child-widows, to which she has devoted her attention. The condition
of the child-widow in India is most pitiable. She is held responsible for the death of her
husband, no matter how young she may be. She is subjected to indignities. Her hair is entirely
shaven from her head. Her jewels are taken from her. Her bright clothing is taken away, and
she is clad in the coarsest garments. She becomes the slave of the family; virtually an outcast;
frequently a prostitute. She can never remarry, no matter how young she may be at the beginning
of her widowhood.

This is an atom: 
It was to ameliorate this condition of affairs that Pundita Ramabai set herself many years
ago. She gathered child-widows under her protection, surrounded them with Christian influences,
and gave them a Christian education. A time of famine threw upon her care in one year twenty-four
hundred girls, who depended upon her alone for food to keep them from starving. That time of
great distress is now past, but when we remember that in India there are estimated to be as
many as two millions of child-widows, it will be clear that the need of a refuge for such is
still immensely great. Girls of the highest caste are in the greatest need, for among the lower
classes the reproach of child-widowhood is not so strongly felt. It was the sorrows of girls
belonging to her own Brahman caste, married perhaps at the age of eight or ten to husbands
five times their own age, and then made practically outcasts by those husbands' death, that
most touched the heart of Ramabai. It is wonderful what she has already accomplished. We found
on her extensive premises a great assembly-room which has sheltered at one time twenty-six
hundred auditors; schools of every grade for Hindu girls, including a school for the blind;
a large and commodious hospital; a printing office with presses capable of turning out a high
order of typography; an asylum for lepers; a rescue-home for unfortunate girls; normal classes
for teachers and for nurses; training in sewing, embroidery, and weaving; and many another
sort of Christian service, including the work of the factory and the farm. Every species of
cooking on the premises, and all the care of the rooms and houses, is done by the girls themselves,
so that all of them are taught how to support themselves when they leave the institution. Three
hours a day for industrial work, and three hours a day for schooling, is the uniform rule.
One can imagine the far-reaching influence of this institution, if he remembers that out of
the twenty-four hundred scholars who were received and taught in that dreadful time of famine,
more than fifteen hundred were child-widows and many of them of the highest caste.

This is an atom: 
Ramabai is a great scholar. She has translated and printed the whole New Testament, in the
colloquial Mahrati dialect, for the benefit of the poor women in her district. She is now engaged
upon the Psalms and the book of Genesis, with the hope of finishing the whole Old Testament.
Numberless tracts of her composition have gone out into all parts of India. Her graduates become
not only teachers, but also evangelists. No one can measure the extent of her present influence,
as showing what a native woman in India can do, in the way of breaking down caste, overthrowing
pernicious customs, and demonstrating to a benighted heathen world the superior claims of Christian
truth. We left Ramabai, invoking a blessing upon her head and upon Manorama, her daughter,
who bids fair to prove her worthy successor. Ramabai, by her intellectual gifts, her executive
ability, and above all by her Christian devotion, deserves honor from all lovers of Christ
and his gospel.

As we neared Madras, the third largest city of India, the heat began to oppress us. Up to this
time India had been unexpectedly and refreshingly cool, at night even cold. But now it was
unpleasantly warm. The heat reminded us of the conundrum: "Why is India, although so hot, the
coldest country on the globe?" Answer: "Because the hottest thing in it is chilly" ("chili"
is the peppery sauce which the natives mix with other spices to form "curry"). We have learned
to like curry. I cannot understand it; but if seems as if the hottest countries needed the
hottest kinds of food. At any rate we had a warm welcome in Madras, thirteen degrees in latitude
above the equator. We were fortunate in reaching this fine city during the session of all our
Baptist missionaries in the South India, or Telugu, field--that field which a few years ago
witnessed the baptism of 2,222 converts in one day. It was a remarkable illustration of the
family and tribal spirit in India. We Baptists believe in individual conversions, and we seek
evidence, in every case, of regeneration by the Holy Spirit. But the coherence of the family
and the village is so strong in a heathen community, that the lot of the individual Christian
is often exceedingly hard. Occasionally there is apostasy. The resistance of an important man
to the gospel makes the persistence of his dependents in the gospel-way almost impossible.

This is an atom: 
In some quarters, however, whole families and whole clans have been blessedly converted, and
idolatry has been completely eradicated. In other cases where mass movements have taken place,
certain missionaries have found it physically impossible to sift out each doubtful individual,
and for safety have demanded that the whole family or clan or village shall give up idolatry
before any single individual convert has been received for church-membership. To combine strict
faith and practice, according to the New Testament standard, with a proper respect for local
customs and traditions, demands great wisdom in our missionaries, and makes their conferences
very practical and very necessary. Certain it is that in our Baptist missions abroad greater
care is exercised in receiving members than that to which we are accustomed in the homeland.
The missionary cannot afford to have false disciples in the flock, if he knows it, for "one
sinner destroyeth much good."

This is an atom: 
New Year's Day at Madras was full of interest. Lady Pentland, wife of the governor of the Madras
Presidency, invited us to a New Year's garden-party. An open-air gathering of any sort on the
first day of January would have been a novelty to us, but this one found the atmosphere so
balmy and the vegetation so green, that such a party was a positive delight. The avenues of
approach to the governor's residence were lined with the body-guard of his excellency, stationed
in twos along the way, and clad in scarlet The reception took place under a wide-spreading
tree, on a spacious lawn. There were as many as a thousand guests. It was a gay and beautiful
scene. Hindu and Moslem, Parsee and Christian, all met together. It was an exhibition of loyalty
to the British Crown, as well as a proof that just government may yet weld all India's classes
and castes together. Lord Pentland spoke to us most pleasantly of certain members of his family
whom we had met in America, and Lady Pentland showed herself to be a charming hostess.

This is an atom: 
But a reception still more charming to us was the reception which the Rochester men gave us
that same New Year's night, at the bungalow of Doctor Ferguson, close to the Day Memorial Chapel,
where the sessions of the conference were held. At least ten of our graduates sat down to supper,
together with their wives. Subsequently, from adjoining rooms, other members of the conference
came in to the New Year's reception, which is an annual affair. The United States consul dropped
in, with a few other guests, until the total number could not have been far from eighty. It
was like a family gathering. When I remembered that the Telugu Mission was once called "The
Lone-Star Mission," and was in danger of being given up, and when I noted that it now numbers
one hundred and sixty-eight churches and a church-membership of more than seventy thousand,
I could but say, "What hath God wrought!"

THE TELUGU MISSION

This is an atom: 
Madras is the greatest city of South India, and ranks next to Calcutta and Bombay in thrift
and importance. Tamil and Telugu are the two languages of the extensive Madras Presidency,
the former prevailing most to the south, the latter to the north. They are cognate tongues,
and both are derived from the Sanskrit. Our American Congregationalists have done most for
the Tamils; we Baptists have done most for the Telugus. The Telugus number twenty-six millions.
Though Madras is near their southern border, it is the best starting-point for our description.

This is an atom: 
Next to our mission in Burma, the Telugu mission has been most blessed by God. The famine of
1876 was followed by a wonderful revival, in which a nation seemed to be born in a day. The
people accepted Christ by the thousands, and twenty-two hundred were at one time baptized.
Evangelization has been followed by education. While our organized Telugu churches number 168,
and our church-members 70,000, we have 819 schools of all grades, and 28,781 pupils under instruction.
The needs of the body have been cared for, as well as the needs of the soul, for there are
fourteen hospitals and dispensaries, ministering to 8,067 patients.

This is an atom: 
In such a mass movement as that among the Telugus, it was inevitable that the organization
of the converts into distinct, self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating churches
should be a gradual process and should require time. The poverty of the people was an obstacle
to self-support. But Christian teaching has made them models of liberality, and it was touching
to see the church-members come forward at the close of the Sunday morning service with their
thank-offerings. In fact, these Telugu churches, in the support of their native ministry, are
in large measure independent of foreign financial aid. It is certain that, so long as religion
is an exotic, its existence will be precarious. The plant in the pot needs, for permanence,
to become a tree rooted in the soil. Self-government is as necessary as self-support, and self-propagation
is equally important, if the Christianity of the native is ever to become indigenous. These
aims have been dominant in recent years, and we have been permitted to witness scenes which
demonstrate the power of God to make multitudes of people, of the lowest class, intelligent,
liberal, and aggressive Christians.

This is an atom: 
I must take four separate stations as illustrations of my thesis. Fortunately, all of these
stations are now under the administration of Rochester men, whom I am proud to recognize as
my former pupils. But before I proceed to describe our experiences with them, I must to some
extent repeat what I have said in my last letter about Madras and the conference there at the
house of Doctor Ferguson. Because Madras is the greatest city of South India, it is the natural
source of supplies and the easiest place of gathering for our Telugu missionaries, even though
most of them live and work much farther to the north. The principle of home rule requires such
gathering, and the missionary at Madras, without seeking it, naturally becomes a sort of secretary
and treasurer and entertainer of the whole body of Telugu workers. No one could be better adapted
to this position of responsibility than is Doctor Ferguson. His abounding hospitality and his
command of the whole situation make him sought as a counselor and as a leader. As the older
men, like Clough and Downie, pass away, Doctor Ferguson, by common consent, forges to the front.
The present prosperity and harmony of the Telugu mission are largely due to his unassuming
and welcome influence. He too is a man whose scholarship and character reflect honor upon the
Rochester Theological Seminary, where he sat under my instruction twenty-two years ago.

This is an atom: 
Coming now to our stations north of Madras, I begin with the Theological Seminary at Ramapatnam,
in charge of the Rev. Dr. Jacob Heinrichs. Its students met us at the entrance of the mission
compound, and we passed under an arch over which were inscribed the words, "Welcome to Dr.
and Mrs. Strong." We had garlands of flowers thrown about our necks, and we were sprinkled
with eau de Cologne. In the large assembly-room of the seminary, we listened to addresses in
excellent English from pupils of the higher grades, and we made responses in the same language,
which were interpreted to the scholars of the lower classes by the pastor of the village church.
A beautiful casket of carved ivory and pearl was presented to us, containing engrossed copies
of the addresses delivered by the students. There was singing of hymns, both in English and
in Telugu, by choir and congregation. The beauty of it all was its spontaneity and naturalness,
for the pupils themselves had planned and executed the whole program.

This is an atom: 
Instruction in this seminary is largely biblical. Preachers are prepared for their work by
being grounded in the life of Christ and the life of Paul. The text-books have been written
by Doctor Heinrichs himself, and they are so well adapted to their purpose that they have been
extensively used by seminaries of other denominations than the Baptist. A native Christian
literature has been created for the Telugus, beginning with the Bible, but now embracing church
history, theology, ethics, and something of modern science. It must not be thought that the
teaching is exclusively religious. Our seminary, and all our schools of lower grade, are affiliated
with the government system of education, and in all their lower grades are subject to government
inspection. So far as they conform to government standards of thoroughness, they receive government
grants of financial aid. British India is impartial--aid is also given to Hindu and to Mohammedan
schools. But Christian schools can well stand competition with these other systems, for the
methods of our Christian schools are more modern and more rational. We left Ramapatnam, convinced
that India is receiving from the work of Doctor Heinrichs an inestimable blessing. Through
a long series of years he has been training preachers and teachers for this whole Telugu land,
and much fruit is appearing in a new type of New Testament pastors and evangelists.

This is an atom: 
Ongole, one hundred and eighty-one miles north of Madras, was the scene of the great revival.
Here too we were received most royally. A crowd of church-members waited for us at the railway
station and flocked round our carriage as we passed to the mission compound. On the way, a
company of Telugu athletes entertained us at intervals by their feats of ground and lofty tumbling.
It was their native way of welcoming distinguished guests. Dr. James M. Baker has ably succeeded
Dr. J. E. Clough in the work of administering and organizing this important field. The Ongole
church of twelve thousand members, with its connected schools, is enough to tax the resources
of the ablest man. The new Clough Memorial Hospital had its beginning while we were in Ongole,
in the laying of the corner-stone of a gateway in honor of Dr. S. F. Smith, who wrote, "Shine
on, Lone Star," as well as "My Country, 'Tis of Thee." Mrs. Strong, with a silver trowel, made
its foundation sure, while the English deputy collector for the district represented the government,
and I had the privilege of making an address to a great mixed audience of Hindus and Mohammedans
as well as Christians.

This is an atom: 
Our most thrilling experience in connection with Ongole I am yet to relate. We wished to see
the heart of India, as we had seen the heart of China and the heart of Burma. We could do this
only by taking part in one of Doctor Baker's country tours. Every year he takes advantage of
the favorable weather centering about mid-winter, to spend two solid months in visiting the
villages which throng these fertile plains. With tent and equipment for cooking, he penetrates
these swarming heathen communities and carries to them the gospel of Christ. It was over some
fearful roads that our two-pony, two-seated buggy enabled us to accompany him. Government roads
are one thing; native roads are quite another. Sudden descents to fordable streams and sudden
ascents to the opposite banks are succeeded by long stretches of passage through cultivated
fields, where there appears no sign of road at all. At last we reached the village of Naletur.
Under the shadow of a great tree we found at least a thousand people assembled, sitting on
the ground bordered by a broad fringe of men and women standing on the outside, and supplemented
by a score of half-naked Zaccheus-like hearers perched in the branches of the trees. Mrs. Baker,
awaiting the coming of her husband and his guests, had been holding this motley audience for
two hours with selections from the gramophone, with illustrated Scripture lessons and pictures
from the Life of Christ, and by calling on her "band" for "music" with a big drum, castanets,
cymbals, and various other instruments of Indian manipulation. Salvation Army methods have
great influence over a childlike people, and Mrs. Baker would make, in case of necessity, a
first-class Salvation Army lassie. In fact, no act of missionary humility has struck our eyes
as more pathetic and true, than that of Mrs. Baker, beating a big drum to the time of native
music, in order to hold an audience for the hearing of the gospel. The amphitheater of dusky
faces, massed together and intently listening, with Christians on one side and heathen on the
other, seemed like a reproduction of the days "when Jesus was here among men," and a prophecy
of the great final Day when our Lord, the Judge, will separate the sheep from the goats.

This is an atom: 
That evening we left the grove and entered the village with fife and drum, attracting auditors,
and held a torchlight meeting in the market-place. There was preaching, and the chanting, in
rhythm but not rhyme, of a versified story of the life of Christ. The missionaries make much
of this sort of Telugu singing. There was the same crowd of auditors that had met us in the
afternoon, but now the intermittent light of the torches made the scene seem to be flashing
rays of conviction into many a troubled breast, and I wished that some great painter could
immortalize the picture upon canvas, for no one can understand missions to the heathen without
picturing to himself such preaching.

This is an atom: 
The next morning, on our way back to Ongole, we visited the famous spot on the river bank at
Vellumpilly where, in 1878, 2,222 believers were baptized. On Sunday we attended a service
of the mission church, where a native pastor officiated and at least fifteen hundred persons
in addition to the missionaries were present, though several hundreds of scholars were absent
on account of the holiday vacation. And finally, at the sunset hour on that memorable Sabbath
Day, we ascended Prayer-meeting Hill, where Doctor Jewett, Mrs. Jewett, and two others met
on New Year's Day fifty years ago, looked out over the great surrounding plain, and prayed
the Lord to give them the Telugus, as John Knox of old prayed, "Give me Scotland, or I die!"
In both cases prayer was answered, and we hope the more recent prayers offered on that historic
spot in January, 1917, will also be answered. The Telugus are gradually being won, and we ourselves
were witnesses to that fact when, at the village of Naletur, we beheld the baptism of eleven
new converts, nine stalwart young men and two married women.

This is an atom: 
Kavali is next to be mentioned. Here is a work for the gradual reformation of criminals and
the industrial regeneration of India. In this land of poverty and famine, our converts, when
turned out of house and home, need new means of earning a livelihood. There is in India a hereditary
criminal class which, like the thugs of a former generation, make it a sort of religion to
prey upon their fellow countrymen. The British Government has been almost powerless either
to subdue or to reform such offenders. Something more than mere justice is required in their
treatment. The Government is recognizing the value of Christian education and supervision,
and has recently put large tracts of territory into the hands of the Salvation Army, the Methodists,
and the Baptists, with a view to combining compulsory work and paternal influence in the reform
of the criminal classes. The Rev. Samuel D. Bawden, at Kavali, has charge of over eight hundred
such people, and is teaching them agriculture and all manner of trades. Mr. Bawden is one of
the graduates of our theological seminary. He was for several years chaplain of our House of
Refuge at Rochester. Physically and mentally he is a remarkable man, an athlete and almost
a giant, a man of science and a man of faith. It needs all these gifts to dominate and lead
toward Christ eight hundred born thieves. I know of no more self-sacrificing and Christlike
work than that which brother Bawden is doing.

This is an atom: 
The success of it proves its value. There are no prison walls, though leaving the community
is followed by pursuit and recommittal. There are no punishments except deprivation of food-wages.
Each member of the community is paid in food, and in proportion to the extent of his labor.
If he will not work, neither can he eat. Opportunities for education are given to all. There
is even a church, made up of converted convicts. The faithful among these Erukalas, as they
are called, are made monitors and helpers to their weaker fellows. Squads are sent out from
five to twenty miles, to build and repair the roads, with only an unarmed comrade for overseer.
Nothing is given but education and Christian influence. Everything for the physical man is
earned. In this way hundreds of reformed criminals learn to gain their own living and to lead
an honest life. It was pathetic to receive the welcome of these humble men, and to see their
reverence and affection for their "big father," Mr. Bawden. We heard them greet him as "our
savior." To show their respect for Mr. Bawden's former theological instructor, these poor men
subscribed of their scanty means and hired a large gasoline street lamp to illuminate the evening
service.

This is an atom: 
I have reserved to the last my account of our visit to Nellore. Nellore is last, but not least,
for this was our first permanent mission station in South India. Work was indeed begun at Vizagapatam
in 1836, but in 1837 it was moved to Madras, and in 1840 to Nellore, Madras being reopened
in 1878. Nellore is one hundred and seven miles north of Madras, on the main line of railway,
and sixteen miles from the seacoast. In the Nellore field we have six churches, and a total
of nine hundred and twenty-six members. It is our Baptist schools that most attract our attention.
The Coles-Ackerman High School, in charge of the Rev. L. C. Smith, has more than eight hundred
pupils, and is a great credit to our denomination. Bible classes and special preaching services
for students are conducted with enthusiasm by our young missionaries, Smith and Manley, and
they bring good results. There are also in Nellore a high school for girls, a hospital for
women, and a nurses' training-school, all under the direction of our Woman's Society. In these
schools, Miss Tencate and Miss Carman are representatives of Rochester.

This is an atom: 
The general work of the mission is presided over by the Rev. Charles Rutherford, one of my
former pupils and graduates. Mr. Rutherford is the young and able successor of Dr. David Downie,
a much older Rochester man, and one of the pioneers and leaders of the Telugu Mission. He graduated
from Rochester in 1872, the year in which I began my work as president of the seminary. I cannot
easily express my gratification at finding him in South India to welcome me, and to accompany
me during a large part of my stay on this field. Few men have so noble a record. Though he
retired from active service ten years ago, and is now devoting himself to writing the history
of the mission, he is still vigorous in mind and heart, and to meet him is to come in contact
with "an incarnation"--an incarnation of the missionary spirit. He has seen "the little one"
become not only "a thousand," but well nigh a hundred thousand. His faith is great, that this
whole Telugu Land will bow to Christ's scepter. Long may he live, to bless India and the world!

This is an atom: 
THE DRAVIDIAN TEMPLES

This is an atom: 
The Dravidians are supposed by most ethnologists to have been the aborigines of India. When
they were subdued by the Aryans from the north, they were crowded southward and were compelled
to serve their conquerors. This subjugation was the origin of caste; the weaker became hewers
of wood and drawers of water for the stronger. The Brahman would have no social intercourse
with the Sudra, and thought even his touch a profanation. For the Brahman represented Brahma,
was in fact Brahma incarnate, while the Sudra was a manifestation of deity in inferior clay.
Yet the Brahman needed the Sudra, and had to propitiate him in order to use him. So the Aryan
absorbed into his own system some of the Dravidian gods, and usually did so by marrying to
Dravidian female divinities male deities of his own. Siva, the Aryan god, for example, took
for his wife the Dravidian goddess Kali. In many ways like this, the Aryan and the Dravidian
united to form the Hindu. The Hindu religion is a composite--a corruption of the nature-worship
of the earlier Vedas by its union with the more cruel and debasing features of the Dravidian
idolatry. The renowned temples of Southern India best represent this mongrel form of Hinduism,
and show Hinduism in its most corrupt development under Dravidian influences.

This is an atom: 
The massiveness and vastness of these temples demonstrate the power of the religious instinct
in man, even when that instinct is most perverted. With all their grossness and crudity, these
shrines reveal a wealth of imagination and an artistic inventiveness, which furnish object-lessons
to the most cultivated Occidental mind. We wonder what the East could really have accomplished,
if its native gifts had been under the control of Christian truth. Unfortunately, those gifts
were commonly under the control of the baser instincts. Paul's philosophy of heathenism is
far more correct than that of many a modern writer on comparative religion. Only an ancestral
sin can explain man's universal ignorance and depravity. Because he would not retain God in
his knowledge, he was given up to the dominion of vile affections, to show him his need of
a divine redemption.

This is an atom: 
Tanjore and Madura are the seats of the Dravidian temples which we visited. Tanjore is two
hundred miles south of Madras, and fifty miles from the Bay of Bengal. It is in the Presidency
of Madras, but European influences have not greatly changed its prevailingly native aspect.
The half-naked coolies, and the children clothed only in sunshine, show how inveterate are
custom and poverty. The great Tanjore temple is the center of worship for a hundred miles round.
It is built on a stupendous scale. It consists of a series of courts, in the midst of which
are two tremendous towers or gopuras, as the technical term should be. Its principal tower,
is pyramidal in form, is two hundred feet in height, is covered with row after row of colossal
carvings of gods and goddesses, and is surmounted by an immense dome-shaped and gilded top
of solid stone, said to have been brought to its place upon an inclined plane from the quarry
four miles away. The gateway leading to the temple is itself an enormous structure. It opens
upon a court eight hundred feet long by four hundred feet wide, the walls of which enclose
an endless succession of little chapels, each one of which has at its back a rude picture of
some incarnation of Vishnu or Krishna, and in front of each picture there stands erect an image
in stone of the lingam or phallus.

This is an atom: 
A great platform, in the center of the court, houses, beneath a gorgeous canopy, an immense
black granite image of a bull, the favorite animal of Siva, carved out of a single block sixteen
feet long and twelve feet high, and kept perpetually shining by anointings of holy oil. The
imagination of the worshiper is thus excited by successive statues and pictures, until at last
he reaches the tremendous pyramidal tower, or gopura, which portrays and symbolizes the power
of the heathen god to destroy and to recreate. That massive tower, superimposed above the idol
and forming its magnificent abiding-place, has no superior in all India for grandeur. Mr. Fergusson,
the distinguished writer on architecture, calls it the most beautiful and effective of all
the towers found in Dravidian temples. The sculptures in the long and dimly lighted corridors
at the base of the temple, and in the first tiers of the tower, are wonderfully realistic representations
of a sensual and ferocious deity. But, as you stand in the court, and look up the sides of
the tower to the gilded pinnacle on its dome, you discover that all the upper rows of gods
and demons are of stucco. Money evidently gave out, as the structure rose, and plaster took
the place of stone.

This is an atom: 
The appurtenances of the temple are tawdry and childish. Huge cars, in which images of the
gods are carried about at times of festival, stand in the courtyard. Each car has its bejeweled
beast for the god or goddess to ride--a wooden elephant, a wooden bull, a wooden rat--each
with trappings of many-colored glass, to imitate rubies and diamonds, and each with its escort
of dusky priests, not forgetting to follow the foreign visitor and hold out their hands for
alms. Yet in these corridors there were prostrated many absorbed and eager worshipers, seeking
protection or aid from a deity more demonlike than divine. One's heart grew sick as he realized
that, still in these latter days,

It was a relief to be conducted by a clergyman of the Anglican faith to the church where lie
buried the remains of Schwartz, the first English missionary to India. It must have required
great gifts of mind and heart and will to brave Hindu opposition, to win the affection and
support of a raja, and to lay the foundations of a Christian community in this heathen land.
Schwartz was a Prussian by birth, though he went out as a missionary of a Danish society. He
gave his life and his fortune to the cause of missions, and the English work in Tanjore is
even now largely supported by the endowments which he left behind him when he died. Our good
friend Doctor Blake, the English clergyman, took us to the palace of the princess of Tanjore,
also to the raja's library of Oriental manuscripts within the palace--a priceless collection
of eighteen thousand Sanskrit manuscripts, of which eight thousand are written on palm-leaves.
This library is unique in all India; and it shows that a raja in Tanjore, in his love for literature,
could equal the raja of Jaipur, in his love for astronomy. The desire for learning was a passion
that survived the fall, an evidence of the presence in humanity of the preincarnate Christ,
"the Light that lighteth every man."

This is an atom: 
Madura is a hundred miles farther south than Tanjore. It is really the center of Dravidian
worship. While some features of the Tanjore temple are more beautiful, the temple at Madura
is more vast. Five great pyramidal towers, four of them on the points of the compass, meet
the eye as one looks upon the temple from a distance. The temple is built about two great shrines
or cells, one for the god Siva and the other for his goddess wife Minakshi, each cell surmounted
by a noble dome of plated gold. On the four sides of the temple are stone porches, arcades,
and pillared halls of great variety, filled with elaborate and grotesque carvings and sculptures.
The extent of the structure may be judged from the simple statement that the outer walls, twenty-five
feet high, surround a space eight hundred and thirty by seven hundred and thirty feet, and
are surmounted by four lofty gate-pyramids, each of them ten stories in height. The portico
roof of Minakshi's Hall is supported upon six rows of carved pillars, each made from a single
stone. There is an extensive "Golden Lily Tank," bordered by a granite corridor hung with cages
of parrots, and the putrid waters of the tank furnish purification preparatory to worship at
Minakshi's shrine. The very porch or entrance pavilion of this shrine is called "The Hall of
a Thousand Pillars," though the actual number is nine hundred and eighty-five. Here and there
among the pillars are seated learned men or pundits, who place offerings of flowers and perfumed
water before their sacred books and chant the meaning of Sanskrit scriptures to groups of devout
listeners.

This is an atom: 
The great temple, with its dimly lighted corridors, is open to the public day and night, and
there is special illumination by hundreds of little lamps in an arch at the entrance when night
comes on. Long avenues are filled with buyers and sellers of wares, and the rent of their stalls
furnishes a large revenue for the support of the many priests. A big elephant and a baby elephant,
each with the mark of the god upon its forehead, are paraded up and down, and are taught to
pick up with their trunks the coins thrown down by visitors. Innumerable dark alcoves invite
the crowd to rest, and many a sleeping form is seen at the foot of the altars. Imagine a festival
night with these dimly lighted courts crowded with worshipers, the fierce and lustful images,
the glorification of the lingam, the secret places of assignation! And this is the acme of
Hindu religion!

This is an atom: 
There are better things than this to be seen in Madura. The palace of Tirumala, a raja of the
seventh century, is a magnificent specimen of Moorish architecture with unexpected Gothic tendencies.
Its entrance hall, one hundred and thirty-five feet long, half as wide, and seventy feet high,
has a lofty roof supported by heavy stone pillars with pointed arches of Saracenic type. It
shows that the Moslem, in the long ago, had at least a temporary hold upon South India. This
palace, which has the structural character of a Gothic building, has now been partially restored
and taken for the law-courts of the British Government.

This is an atom: 
The same Tirumala who built the palace, built the Teppa Kulam, an artificial reservoir outside
the town, about one thousand feet on a side, very symmetrical and the largest of its kind in
South India. The whole "tank" is surrounded with granite walls and parapets, and next the water
there is a granite walk five feet wide running round the whole structure. Flights of steps
lead down to the water, at intervals. In the center of this small lake is an island, also walled
around with granite slabs, and on it there are five towers, a large one in the center and one
at each of the four corners. The whole effect is very graceful and it makes a sight long to
be remembered, when the "feast of lights" takes place and the island and the parapets and the
granite curbings are illuminated with hundreds of little oil-lamps. Not far away from the "tank"
is a famous banyan-tree which covers with its shade an area sixty yards in diameter, has a
main stem seventy feet in circumference, and has besides two hundred branches that have struck
root.

This is an atom: 
But the noblest sight of Madura is its American Congregational Mission. Beginning in 1836,
the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions planned and founded their most wise
and successful foreign missions. They have aimed to do one thing well: to make the Madura station
not only complete but well supported, to embrace in it all stages of education and all sorts
of evangelization; and to reduce the whole work to a unified system. And the result has been
the raising up of a large native ministry, churches with twenty-two thousand members, schools
of every grade from the kindergarten to the college and the theological seminary. We were most
hospitably entertained by the principal of the college, Dr. J. X. Miller, and the other missionaries;
and we met and addressed both the native church at their Sunday service, the faculty and students
of the seminary, and the annual conference of Congregational missionaries. The Madura Mission
is a light shining in a dark place, the darkest place indeed in India. But it is a light that
cannot be hid. Like our missions to the Burmans and the Telugus, it is showing the power of
the gospel to "cast down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the
knowledge of God," and to make a spiritual desert "bud and blossom as the rose."

This is an atom: 
TWO WEEKS IN CEYLON

This is an atom: 
Ceylon is not a part of India. It is a Crown Colony of Great Britain, and is administered directly
from London, while India has more of independence and self-government. The relation of Ceylon
to Britain is somewhat like that of the Philippine Islands to the United States, while the
relation of Britain to India resembles that of the United States Government to our several
territories. Ceylon, however, is very productive and prosperous. Surrounded by the sea, it
is free from Indian droughts and famines. Its people are stalwart and loyal. The English language
is fast becoming the easiest method of communication between Cingalese and Tamils, Hindus and
Malays. Colombo is really a European city, as large as Rochester, with noble public buildings
and lovely parks. Our Galle Face Hotel, on the very edge of the sea, with a great stretch of
green lawn in front of it, is one of the finest hotels in the East, and our week of rest here
was delightful.

This is an atom: 
Buddhism has been one of the great missionary religions of the world. It was a reform of Hinduism.
But the Hindus, with their caste system, would have none of it and drove it out. The Buddhist
triumphs were in Burma, Tibet, China, Japan, at the north; in Ceylon and Java, at the south.
Here in Ceylon is preserved a sacred tooth of Buddha; and one of his bones, recently discovered
in northern India, is to be brought next week with great pomp and ceremony to the temple in
Kandy, which already ranks in sacredness next to the great Shwe Dagon pagoda in Rangoon. A
temple in Java is founded upon a single hair of Buddha's head. All this superstition and imposture
dates back to a couple of centuries before Christ, and there is great reason to believe that
the Roman Catholic worship of relics is only an appropriation of this form of heathenism.

This is an atom: 
Christian schools and churches are doing much to undermine Buddhism in Ceylon. Colombo is especially
fortunate in possessing a noble college of the Wesleyan Methodists and a strong institution
of all grades with eight hundred students. The English Baptists also have a very creditable
mission work under the charge of Messrs. Ewing and Charter; while Mr. Woods is the able pastor
of an English-speaking Baptist church. The students of these various schools usually adopt
the English dress. The barefooted pupils first put on shoes, then the coat, finally the trousers.
In the end you can hardly distinguish them from Europeans. These changes are more rapid in
Colombo than in Madras. Indeed, British rule is fast transforming what was first a Portuguese,
and then a Dutch, settlement into a city where English is universally known and spoken.

This is an atom: 
It was gratifying to find that the Government College, where the English language alone is
used, is opened every day with the reading of Scripture and with prayer. But it was unpleasing
to learn that, side by side with these Christian influences, the Ananda College, a theosophical
institution, allied to Mrs. Besant of Madras, was exerting an influence unfavorable to Christianity,
not only by setting Buddha side by side with Christ, but by urging the claim of Buddha to be
the supreme ethical teacher of the world.

This is an atom: 
Before I tell you of our visit to Buddhist temples, I must speak of the refuge from them which
we found at Nurwara Eliya, sixty-two hundred feet above the sea. Colombo is only six degrees
north of the equator. Here in January the sun casts hardly any shadow at noon, and the middle
of the day is hot. Later in the year the heat is intense, day and night. So British officials
combine with the rich of every tongue, and even with the missionaries, to make their summer
quarters high up among the hills. We were transported thither on a narrow-gage railway, cut
into the sides of precipices, running through tunnels, and so tortuous as to form a hundred
horseshoe loops. The road seemed almost a miracle of engineering. But the views were beautiful
beyond description. It was Switzerland without its ruggedness. It was Italy on the southern
side of the Alps, as "Philip van Artevelde" best describes it:

This is an atom: 
Sublime, but neither bleak nor bare
    Nor misty, are the mountains there;
    Softly sublime, profusely fair;
    Up to their summits clothed in green,
    And fruitful as the vales between,
    They lightly rise
    And scale the skies,
    And groves and gardens still abound,
    For where no shoot
    Can else take root,
    The peaks are shelved and terraced round.

This is an atom: 
I am inclined to think that, of all the beautiful railway rides I have ever taken, this was
the finest. From the rice-fields of the plains we passed upward through endless tea-plantations,
where every inch of soil was preserved and utilized by the construction of artificial terraces.
In the midst of these plantations, rubber trees were set at intervals. There were many instances
when we looked down from our airy perch, on the edge of a precipice, at least a thousand feet,
and saw ourselves on the side of a veritable amphitheater of mountains towering a thousand
feet above us and covered with rows of tea-plants from the bottom to the top. This amphitheater
was often two miles across, every foot of the ground minutely cultivated and a perfect sea
of verdure. But, as we went up, the palm gave place to the pine; cold succeeded to heat; and
to be at all comfortable at our hotel we were obliged to order fire in our rooms.

This is an atom: 
Beautiful for situation as was Nurwara Eliya, we were glad, on account of the January cold,
to leave it. And we went to Kandy. I wonder whether our word "candy" is derived from that sweet
place. I agree with some celebrated author, whose name I forget, in saying that "Kandy is the
loveliest city in the loveliest island in the world." Of late years Kandy has become the resort
of tourists, though the present war has greatly diminished their number. A hotel that was accustomed
to entertain fifty guests now has only half a dozen. But the beauty of the place abides. An
artificial lake, with an island of green in its center and winding among a forest of stately
palms, is surrounded by a circlet of hills. On the summit of one of these hills is the Missionary
Rest-house, founded and endowed by a wealthy Christian woman for the relief of pilgrims, as
was the House Beautiful of Bunyan's story. There we were invited to afternoon-tea, and as I
looked upon the fairylike landscape I almost thought the Garden of Eden had come again.

This is an atom: 
But I could not long be deceived, for at the very foot of this hill was the most famous Buddhist
temple of Ceylon. If this is Paradise, it is Paradise Lost. Here Buddha's tooth is worshiped,
and here a newly discovered bone of his body is to add sanctity to the temple. We attended
the evening worship, which consisted of a torchlight procession of priests, with beating of
tom-toms and frenzied dancing of musicians, which would have done credit to the savagery of
the Fiji Islands. The temple here has no lofty pagoda. It shows what the original pagoda really
was, for this temple has a number of bell-shaped structures resting on the ground. Next, historically,
came the elevation of the bell upon a stone platform; and, finally, the lifting of it into
the air, resplendent with gilding. Kandy illustrates the humble beginnings of Buddhistic worship,
but with later accessories begotten by irrational devotion.

This is an atom: 
I should mention, however, the only sign of intelligence which I found in this Buddhist temple.
It was the library of Pali manuscripts containing the sacred books and stories of Buddha's
life and doctrine. Many of these manuscripts were written on palm-leaves and were wrapped in
silken coverings. Some had been presented by Siamese and by Burmese kings. Some were ancient.
I saw no priest who could read them, and I fancy that the sacred books are really studied only
by pundits, whose vocation is that of teaching, and whose personal beliefs may be very different
from those of orthodox Buddhism. It was pleasant to find, not far from the Temple of the Tooth,
a little church of the English Baptists, which sends out light into all the surrounding darkness.
Its pastor is a native Christian, who preaches every Sunday morning in Cingalese and every
Sunday evening in English, while his week-days are devoted to the work of conducting an English
boys' school.

This is an atom: 
Kandy is celebrated also for its botanical gardens. Only those of Java compare with them in
completeness. The long avenues of palms of different varieties--palmyra, talipot, sago, royal,
sealing-wax--and the specimens of bamboo, India rubber, and rain-tree, are unique and wonderful.
The rain-tree is so called because the vast spread of its branches and the density of its foliage
collect the dew to such an extent as actually to water the ground upon which it drops. Think
of viewing in one morning of two hours' length, a score of trees we had hitherto known only
in the tales of the tropics: the traveler's tree with its fernlike leaves, the cannon-ball
tree, the deadly upas, the nourishing breadfruit, the clove, the cinnamon, the mace or nutmeg,
the vanilla, the guava, the cork, the almond, the mulberry, the mango, the sandalwood! There
were great screw-pines, lignum-vitae, mahogany, mimosa, magnolia trees; and the tree-fern,
the giant creeper, the panama-hat plant, the Peruvian cactus, the papyrus, the pineapple, and
a great collection of orchids. Only the sunshine and the moisture of Ceylon could produce such
a result. A tree cared for from its first sprouting, and favored by the elements, becomes a
wonder of the world. It shows what man may become under the tutelage of God.

This is an atom: 
Anurajahpura was our last place to visit. Far to the north of Colombo, it is the most important
extant specimen of the ruined cities of Ceylon. Before the time of Christ it was the seat of
a kingdom that embraced the whole island. Buddhism, after a life-and-death struggle, captured
it and erected in it structures for worship, which for grandeur and beauty rivaled those of
Burma. Two pagodas, or dagobas, of solid brick, each of them more than two hundred feet high,
tower up before one as he enters the town. These structures are covered with verdure, for grasses
and shrubs have eaten their way into the mortar on the sides, until the dagobas resemble conical
natural hills. It is said that the brick of a single one would suffice to build a wall eight
feet high and a foot thick from Edinburgh to London. One of them is being restored, and fifty
men are at work upon it, tearing away the vegetation and building anew the outside covering
of brick. The dagoba itself is not a temple, for it is solid and has no chamber within; but
at its base is a structure, infinitesimal in size as compared with the one that towers above
it, and in this structure there is a reclining statue of Buddha seventy feet long. Buddha must
have been a giant, for his footprints are four feet long, and his tooth is as large as the
tooth of an alligator, and surprisingly like one.

This is an atom: 
The grounds in the neighborhood of these towering dagobas are strewn with ruins. Sixteen hundred
pillars of stone, seven feet high, remain to show the vast foundations of an ancient Buddhist
monastery. There is also a temple excavated in the solid rock of the hillside, and adorned
with curious carvings of elephants. We made the acquaintance of its high priest under very
peculiar circumstances. We met him at a funeral. It was the cremation of one of his priests.
On the outskirts of the village a great crowd surrounded a burning pyre. Two or three cords
of rough wood had been piled up, with the body of the priest in its center and the bier on
which the body had been brought laid upon its top. The fire was blazing upward, and a deafening
beating of tom-toms gave sacredness to the obsequies. The awe-stricken followers of Buddha
stood at a little distance around, while the flames grew fierce, and the sickening odor of
burning flesh entered their nostrils. It was no wonder that they were willing to follow the
high priest, when he came to salute me as a minister of religion from the other side of the
world. He was eighty-eight years of age. Clothed in his saffron robe and holding with trembling
hands his rod of office, he seemed the decaying specimen of a moribund religion. He presented
me with an umbrella of yellow silk. It had an ivory handle with the carving of a lotus bud
on its end. I could not let him make such a present without some reward, and he seemed grateful
for the few rupees which my interpreter wrapped up in his handkerchief. He lifted up his fan
and fanned me, as we parted, while he uttered some words of blessing. I could hardly doubt
his good will, or fail to hope that some gleams of heavenly light had come to him from Christ,
the Light of the world. But Anurajahpura was, like Pagan in Burma, the type of a vanishing
religion, and its high priest was, like the Jewish high priest of old, the type of a priesthood
sure to pass away, since Christ, the true High Priest, has come.

This is an atom: 
JAVA AND BUDDHISM

This is an atom: 
We have crossed the equator, and the Southern Cross, invisible to northern eyes, seems still
to beckon us onward. But we have reached the most distant point of our journey, and henceforth
we shall be homeward bound, taking China and Japan as we go. Java is not so hot as we expected.
An island like Cuba, six hundred miles long and only two hundred broad, has sea-breezes enough
to keep it tolerably cool. Rain falls almost every day, with an average of twelve feet in a
year. As the moisture is excessive, all sorts of vegetation are luxuriant. Java is a gem of
the ocean, and an emerald gem at that. Life here is as easy as anywhere on earth, and there
is a swarming population. While Ceylon, similar in area, has only five millions of inhabitants,
Java has thirty-five millions.

This is an atom: 
Java is the jewel of the Dutch Crown, one of the most fertile and productive islands of the
world. Coffee and tea, rice and sugar, salt and spice, tobacco and corn, coal and oil, coconut
and rubber, are exported in an aggregate of two hundred millions of our dollars every year,
while the aggregate of imports is little more than a hundred and twenty millions. The Dutch
have taken a colony whose deficits once frightened the English into abandoning it, and by the
famous "culture system" of letting out the land upon wise conditions as to the kind and quantity
of production, have turned the whole island into a veritable garden, and a principal source
of revenue for Holland. The Dutch indeed have drawn from Java much more than they have given.
The Roman Empire should have taught them that incorporation of a colony, and privilege granted
to it, were the only security for permanent possession. Until ten years ago, however, the Dutch
policy was one of repression rather than one of development. While Britain has tried by her
schools and hospitals to Anglicize India, Holland, for many years, tried to keep the Javanese
apart and in subjection, discouraging their study of the Dutch language and giving them also
no share in the government. This policy has at last been seen to be suicidal; Chinese immigration
has added an element of vigor, industry, and discontent; the modern movement in India and in
Japan has provoked new aspirations here; even the Malay has become aware that he has rights.
Dutch schools have at last begun to educate the people; the more progressive among the students
are also learning English; and Java now bids fair to press forward to occupy a position in
the van of national and democratic progress.

This is an atom: 
I am deeply impressed with the density and vastness of this population. Only Belgium surpasses
Java in the number of inhabitants to the square mile. We have taken a ride by rail for four
hundred miles through the center of the island. We have passed volcanoes actually smoking;
for a long range of mountains, rising sometimes to a height of twelve thousand feet, constitutes
the back-bone of Java. There are sublime and beautiful landscapes all along the way, sublime
because of their occasionally rocky grandeur, and beautiful because of the minute cultivation
that adorns both hillside and plain. The endless rice-fields, and the fields of sugar-cane
that stretch for miles like a billowy sea, make a railway journey by day a constant source
of delight. You ride in a perennial garden, and it is perfectly natural that the bird of paradise
should have its habitat here. Like Ceylon, Java is sure to be the resort of innumerable tourists,
for here are wonders beyond any to be found in localities more commonly visited.

This is an atom: 
And yet it is the people that interest one even more than the land they live in. We turned
aside at different points, from the stations of the railways, and got glimpses of the Javanese
in their country homes. I am bound to say that these homes were often primitive in the extreme,
mere shacks or huts of bamboo and thatch, often without windows and with only a door in front
and a door behind, sometimes standing in a pool of shallow water or lifted on stilts to escape
the rain. But everybody seemed to be at work, except on market-days, when the whole population
of a district gathered in a country fair. The throng and press of these trading-days, the strife
and din, the variety of wares, and the sharpness of competition, were something new to us and
long to be remembered. The amusements of the Javanese, their music, their shadow-dances, all
show a vigor and passion, which explain their occasional use of the "kriss" or Malay dagger,
and the difficulty of subduing and civilizing so ardent and imaginative a people. But they
are a people _sui generis_, and sure, when roused and educated, to take their part on the modern
stage.

This is an atom: 
I have intimated that the Dutch Government has seen its past mistakes, and has entered upon
a new and more generous policy. Nothing could demonstrate this better than the botanical gardens
at Buitenzorg. These are unique in the world, the most complete and the most practical. The
gardens at Kandy in Ceylon are more artistically arranged and are more beautiful to the ordinary
visitor. But these in Java are more scientific and more helpful to the general development
of the country. They include the chemical investigation of agricultural products, as well as
the testing of their nutritive value and their tensile strength. Rubber planters are shown
proper methods of culture, and also improved methods of preparing the product for market. Seventy
different varieties of rice have been discovered and classified; and the tillers of the soil
have been shown how they can greatly increase the yield of their acreage. All the great botanical
collections of the world communicate their novelties and discoveries to the Java gardens. Here
at Buitenzorg there is a school of forestry and another of veterinary science, each of these
with practical demonstrations. Trees and plants in the gardens are grouped in scientific classes,
the palms by themselves, the pines by themselves. Here the _Victoria regia_, the royal pond-lily,
flourishes in its proper habitat. The avenues of kanari trees, with their lofty overarching
vaulting, are grander than any nave of French cathedral. It will be seen at once that the Botanical
and Experimental Gardens of Java are of immense service to agriculture and to science throughout
the world. We had the great privilege of being personally conducted through them by Dr. K.
J. Lovink, Director of the Dutch Department of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce.

This is an atom: 
I wish I could say as much for the religious prospects of Java as I can say for its economical
and political prospects. There is even greater need of change in this regard, for the island
has been a very stronghold of Buddhism, as it is now of Mohammedanism. When driven out from
India, the Buddhist missionaries came to Java and here found a welcome. Javanese kings erected
temples so enormous and so rich in sculpture that, defaced and decayed as they now are, they
have no superiors on earth. It was, indeed, the fame of Boro Budor, that most attracted us
to Java, and we made a journey of thirteen hours to inspect this renowned ruin.

This is an atom: 
Imagine a structure upon an eminence from which it is visible for miles, yet walled in on one
side by a lofty range of mountains, and on the other side commanding a magnificent view of
cultivated plains. Imagine a temple of brick, like the great pyramid of Egypt, more than five
hundred feet square, with five broad terraces, the uppermost of which encloses an immense sitting
statue of Buddha. The topmost crown of this solid structure rises more than two hundred feet
above the ground.

This is an atom: 
The wonder of Boro Budor is, however, not the vastness of the structure, containing though
it does an amount of material five times as great as that of any English cathedral, so much
as it is the enormous amount of artistic work that has been expended upon it. Each of these
five terraces has sculptured upon its side walls some representation in bas-relief of the legendary
incidents of Buddha's existence, not only in the present state, but in his previous states
of being. You walk, as it were, through a picture-gallery of the life of Buddha. The bas-reliefs
are wrought out with such delicacy as to suggest the influence of Greek art upon the multitude
of artists who toiled for years to produce them. The effect, at least, is Grecian; and the
number of the plaques is so great that, if they were placed in a continuous row, the line would
be three miles long.

This is an atom: 
Besides these sculptures, the terrace-walls are interrupted at regular intervals by four hundred
and thirty-six niches or alcove-chapels, each with its image of Buddha facing the outside world,
so that the visitor approaching the temple cannot fail to see one hundred and nine Buddhas,
or one-fourth of the total number, looking down upon him. Above these alcove-chapels there
are seventy-two small latticed domes, or dagobas, each with its statue of Buddha imprisoned
within, as if he were preparing himself, by seclusion and meditation, for the final state in
which the great chamber which crowns the structure represents him, I mean the state of passivity
and bliss, which has escaped the evils of transmigration and has attained to absorption of
personal existence of the impersonal world-force which the Hindu called Brahma.

This is an atom: 
It is difficult to express the emotions which are roused by such an exhibition of man's religious
instinct, enlightened simply by God's revelation of himself in the natural world and in the
nature of man. Here is a seeking, but not a finding, a groping in the dark, with only the faint
rays of conscience to show man the way. Yet he who is the Light of the World was lighting every
man, before his advent in the flesh, and even Buddha was a reformer and an advance upon the
Brahmanism of his time. He preached the doctrine of unselfish devotion, but he turned it into
error by ignoring man's duty to himself. He made extinction of desire, rather than purification
of desire, to be the way to happiness. How different this from that thirst after God, even
the living God, which animated the Psalmist, or that hungering and thirsting after righteousness
which Christ says shall be filled! Buddha found in self, rather than in God, the power to overcome
evil. Buddhism has no personal God to whom appeal may be made for strength, and Buddha himself
has no power to answer prayer, since he long ago passed into a realm of inactivity which is
practically indistinguishable from non-existence. There is no atonement for past sin nor escape
from its consequences, but by the giving up of being. Buddhism is a pessimistic and joyless
religion. Hence it suffers deterioration in competition with the more active systems. Close
by Boro Budor, where Buddhism reached its culmination, are the temples of Mendoet and Brambanam,
which show a reversion in the popular mind to Hindu Brahmanism. And when the Moslem came, with
his doctrine of a personal and living God, Buddhism had no force to combat it. Boro Budor,
once the center of worship for a mighty kingdom, now stands alone and desolate in a great wilderness,
without priest or worshiper. Djokjokarta, the next city in size to Batavia, is to-day more
Mohammedan than Buddhist. Christian schools and missions are doing much to turn this moral
wilderness into beauty. To convert Java to Christianity will add to Christ's subjects the very
Queen of the East.

THE RENAISSANCE IN INDIA

This is an atom: 
A recent book by Prof. C. F. Andrews, formerly of the Cambridge Brotherhood in Delhi, has arrested
my attention, as the best extant synopsis of the religious history and prospects of that great
country. It is entitled "The Renaissance in India." It has not yet been reprinted in America,
and can be obtained only in the British Isles. I have thought it worth while to make it known
among us by writing a review, and the following paper might perhaps serve such a purpose. But,
in the writing, so many thoughts and illustrations of my own have suggested themselves, that
I cannot credit Professor Andrews with the result, except in part, and I submit my work as
my own almost as much as it is his.

This is an atom: 
Let me first, however, do Professor Andrews the justice of explaining that the Cambridge Brotherhood
is a semimonastic fraternity of the Church of England, which aims to convert India to Christianity
by indoctrinating its higher classes. All its members are bachelors, and their pure life as
well as their learning and liberality are attractive to educated heathen seekers after God.
Our author is himself a devout believer in a preexistent Christ, and he recognizes some rays
of Christ's light in Buddha and in Confucius. This faith has led him to sever his connection
with the Cambridge Brotherhood of late, and to connect himself with the school of Rabindranath
Tagore, whom the British Government has recently knighted for his poetical gifts and for his
political loyalty. Members of the Brotherhood have thought this leaving of their body a mistake
of judgment, and too great a concession to a rival religion, while they still admire the self-devotion
which leads their former brother to carry his advocacy of Christianity into what he regards
as the most promising school of Hinduism. With this explanation I proceed to the treatment
of my subject.

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
In the fifteenth century the European world was intellectually born again. The barbarian Goths
and Vandals had put an end to the Roman Empire, and learning had taken refuge in the monasteries.
Even that learning had become ecclesiastical. Precious manuscripts of the Greek classics had
their original writing wiped off to make room for monkish homilies. The people were in ignorance
and were ruled by the priests. But the Crusades had brought about a new intercourse between
the West and the East. The fall of Constantinople sent Greek books and Greek scholars to Venice
and to Rome. Greek art inspired Michelangelo and Raphael. A great wave of enthusiasm for the
new learning swept over Europe. The printing-press multiplied copies of the old literature
and put them in the hands of the poor. It was the precursor of a new civilization, and because
it was a new birth of thought, we call it the Renaissance.

This is an atom: 
The Renaissance, however, needed another factor to complement it. Not merely intellect was
sleeping, but also man's moral nature. Conscience and will required new stimulus. Religious
reformation was necessary as much as intellectual revival. Greek books brought with them the
vice, as well as the art, of the East. Renaissance without Reformation produced the Borgias
and their unspeakable wickedness. Erasmus without Luther would never have saved Europe from
ruin. It was the new view of Christ that showed men their sins, brought repentance and hope,
purified literature, gave power to social truth, and united with the new learning to make possible
our modern civilization. It was a triumph of Christianity over the powers of darkness, for
Christianity involves both Renaissance and Reformation.

This is an atom: 
A similar intellectual change has been coming over the Eastern world, and has been awakening
the slumbering nations. Who would have foretold a half-century ago that Turkey and Persia,
Japan and China, would now have constitutional governments and legislative assemblies? The
world has moved very fast during the past decade. Modern inventions have given new wings to
thought, the nations have been coming to self-consciousness, freedom is in the air, even war
is teaching the absurdity of committing the destiny of a whole people to the arbitrary rule
of any single monarch. The success of Japan in her struggle with Russia aroused the whole East.
China has awaked from the sleep of ages. And India is the scene of unrest, and will not be
satisfied until her vast populations are given a larger share in her government.

This is an atom: 
India has witnessed the beginnings of her renaissance. The universities which her rulers have
established have diffused the new learning. But they have also raised up a host of educated
men, some of whom can find no employment except in sedition. False philosophies, imported from
the West, have made these same men agnostic, and have disposed them to put evolution in place
of God. Old religions have lost even their little power to control the moral life, and a vague
desire for independence of all restraint has led to revolutionary and even anarchistic plots.
We have some of the same dangers in our Southern States. The negro is in many cases receiving
a higher education than he can utilize, and is becoming a possible leader of revolt, while
there is a vast inflammable multitude of uneducated negroes whom he can incite to violence
and disorder. As with us, Christianity is needed side by side with education, so in India to-day,
intellectual renaissance needs to be supplemented by religious reformation.

This is an atom: 
A glance at the history of India's religious systems will help our understanding of the problem.
The earliest record is that of the Rig-Veda. It is a recognition of the powers of nature, and
an exaltation of them to divine honor and worship. The apostle Paul gives us the further explanation
that this deification of God's works was the result of a previous unwillingness to retain the
personal God in their knowledge. To worship God's manifestations is to lose the sense of his
unity and his moral governance. Men preferred the sun in the heavens to the Sun of Righteousness.
They lost sight of the true God in self-chosen admiration of his works. "While the Semitic
mind gravitated toward the ethical and the personal, the Aryan gravitated toward the philosophic
and the impersonal."

This is an atom: 
The Upanishads are the second series of Hindu scriptures. These practically identify the human
soul, as well as all natural objects, with the supreme God. The self is only a manifestation
of Brahma. The trend is toward absolute pantheism. The individual is lost in the whole, and
the realization of this is salvation. But humanity cannot be content without the semblance
of personality in God, and since everything has become divine, it was easy to regard not only
natural powers, but also personal beings as gods. Polytheism was the result. Vishnu and Siva,
gods of reproductive and destructive powers, came to be worshiped. Incarnation and transmigration
followed. The incarnation was not the incarnation of the supreme Brahma, but of one of the
subordinate deities, Vishnu, and even this incarnation was but a temporary assumption of human
form--a vanishing manifestation, to be put off again like a worn-out garment when the real
god returned to his heaven. The Hindu Trimurti was never the Christian Trinity; for Christ
is not only the supreme God manifest in the flesh, but also the eternal Revealer of God, who
takes our humanity to be a part of himself forever, the partaker of his inmost being and the
sharer of his throne.

This is an atom: 
While we credit Hinduism with the idea of incarnation, we regard it as only showing this to
be a necessity of human thought, and as far from satisfying man's longings for union with God.
Gautama Buddha, passionless and lost in the contemplation of his own excellence, is not the
Christian Redeemer, who daily bears our burdens and takes upon himself, in order that he may
take away, the sin of the world. And what shall we say of the other deities of the Hindu pantheon,
but that they are personifications of every human caprice and vice. The Krishna of the Puranas
has infected all India with his licentiousness, and has given sanction to the worst forms of lust.

This is an atom: 
The growth of caste was another result of the loss of a personal and moral God and the deification
of his works. Since all things came to be regarded as manifestations of deity, the order of
society and its distinctions became fixed. The origin of caste is to be found in the superiority
of the Aryan conqueror to the Dravidian aborigines. The people of light complexion looked down
on the dark-skinned race, and drove them to the wall. Intermarriage between the two classes
of the population became abhorrent to the ruling class, and all manner of restrictions were
put upon their intercourse, till even the shadow of the outcaste falling upon the Brahman brought
contamination. Let us not blame the Aryan too hastily, for in South Africa and in our own Southern
States we see the same denial that God has made of one blood all the races of men, and the
same exclusion of the darker race from all privileges of human brotherhood. Slave-owners were
shocked when Abraham Lincoln lifted his hat to salute a negro, and Southern men protested when
President Roosevelt entertained Booker Washington at his table. Christian proclamation of human
brotherhood constitutes one of the chief obstacles to the success of the gospel in India.

The low place of woman and her lack of education is another obstacle which must be removed
if India is to profit by the renaissance of learning. This undervaluing of the physically weak
is itself a fruit of man's apostasy from God. And as Brahmanism set its stamp of approval upon
distinctions of caste and fixed them for centuries, so it was with woman's position and influence.
She was condemned to inferiority. She became a mere instrument of man's pleasure, or a mere
drudge in his household. She never sat with him at his meals, but ate what was left after he
had been served; she never walked by his side, but always followed behind, when she was not
shut up in the zenana at home. One of the best signs of a new civilization in India is the
growing conviction among the higher classes that woman must be educated, if her children are
to emerge from their superstitions and become of use in the modern world. The suttee has been
abolished by law, but child-widowhood yet remains to curse the lives of millions. There is
no better proof that Christianity is permeating society with its influence than is found in
the increasing number of girls who are seeking education in our mission schools and colleges.
Pundita Ramabai has become a glory to her own countrymen, as much as has Rabindranath Tagore
by his utterance, "The regeneration of the Indian people to my mind, directly and perhaps solely,
depends upon the removal of this condition of caste." We may add that the dominion of caste
and the degradation of woman will come to an end together, and nothing but Christianity will
abolish them.

This is an atom: 
The renaissance of learning is not enough. A new spirit of love is needed to solve the problems
of India. For there is no country of the world where racial antagonisms are so felt. Entirely
apart from the distinctions of caste, which are racial in their origin, there is the distinction
of Hindu from Mohammedan, which has its origin in religion. Remember that, of India's population,
sixty-five millions are Moslems, while one hundred and eighty millions are Hindus. The Hindu
men of caste cannot help paying some respect to the Mohammedans, for they are compelled to
acknowledge their financial and executive power, just as they acknowledge, without admiring,
the power of their British rulers. They cannot treat Moslems as outcastes, but they will not
associate with them; and they cherish a settled antipathy to them. All this the Mohammedans
heartily reciprocate. English policy has in times past cultivated this mutual dislike, lest
union between the two religious sects should lead to the formation of a party too strong for
British rule to keep in subjection. One religion has been used to defeat the influence of the
other. Of late years only has it been true that both have been forced to recognize the impartial
justice of British rule; and this recognition has been gained by the gradual admission of able
men from both parties to many important judicial and administrative positions in the Indian
government. But the antagonism of religions still remains, and it constitutes a most serious
bar in the way of a united India.

There are signs of an approaching reformation in India which will supplement its intellectual
renaissance. Just as the growing power of Christianity in the second and third centuries of
our era was shown by the competition of new and imitative religions like that of Mithra, and
by spasmodic attempts on the part of the old heathenism to interpret its mythology symbolically
and to reform its moral practice; just as the growing power of the gospel in the fifteenth
century led the Roman Church to slough off some of its abuses and to tolerate among its adherents
reformers before the Reformation; so in India the new learning from the West and the missionary
proclamation of the gospel have brought about a state of religious unrest which could only
be allayed by efforts on the part of Hindus and Moslems alike to interpret their faiths more
rationally and to prove that these faiths were equal if not superior to Christianity itself.
The Brahmo-Somaj, which Ram Mohun Roy founded at the end of the eighteenth century, largely
as a result of his horror at the murder of his sister by suttee, has led to the abolition of
that cruelty. Ram Mohun Roy sought to purge Hinduism of its corruptions by appealing to its
earlier and purer scriptures. He was the first to establish a vernacular press in India, and,
with Alexander Duff, the first English schools. Though he did not formally profess Christianity,
he studied our Christian Scriptures, acknowledged their value and influence, and published
a book entitled "The Precepts of Jesus."

This is an atom: 
Another Hindu who exerted great influence during the half-century just passed was Keshub Chunder
Sen. He passionately adored Christ as his true Master. Yet he was practically Unitarian, and
his later years belied the promise of his brilliant beginnings. Though a member of the Brahmo-Somaj,
he split the body in two by his violation of its prohibition of child-marriage, and wasted
his strength in attempts to combine Western rationalism with the ecstatic fervors of the East.
As the result, the Brahmo-Somaj has declined, until in numbers and influence it has now hardly
more than five thousand adherents in all India. Mozumdar was one of its representatives who
sought to give Oriental interpretation of Jesus, but one without ethical or saving power. The
Arya-Samaj is a more consistent effort to reform Hindu religion by bringing it back to the
purer standards of the Vedas. Swami Dayanand was the founder of the society. He was led to
renounce idolatry by seeing a mouse eat food offered to an idol and run without hindrance over
the idol's robes and hands. Of all the reforming bodies, the Arya-Samaj most retains the confidence
of the masses in the north of India. But its tenets are not acceptable to the educated classes
of the south, and it needs a further infusion of both science and religion.

This is an atom: 
Thus far we have treated only of Hindu progress. A word must be said of progress among the
Moslem population of India. Here the Aligarh Movement demands attention. Sir Seyd Ahmad Khan
was its leader. He was of noble family, entered the English service, and took part with the
British in crushing the mutiny of 1857. When the Mohammedan population afterward fell under
suspicion, he gathered round him a company of liberal young men and sought by educational means
to bridge the gulf between Moslem and English. He claimed that British rule in India represented
Christian civilization, and that this is no enemy to Islam, but only its complement and helper.
He saw that only religion could heal the breach and rescue Islam from decline. He founded the
Aligarh College in Delhi, and devoted himself to the cultivation of friendliness, not only
between Moslem and English, but also between Moslem and Hindu. This college is one of the strongest
educational forces in North India.

This is an atom: 
Returning to Hindu progress, we mark the work of such men as the Swami Vivekananda. It will
be remembered that he represented India at our Chicago Parliament of Religions, where Joseph
Cook challenged the priests of the Orient to answer Lady Macbeth's question, "Who shall cleanse
this red right hand?" Vivekananda sought to blend Christian philanthropy with the Vedantic
philosophy. Identity with the Supreme is to be attained, not only by passive contemplation,
but also by active unselfish service. But this truth was mixed with strange interpretations
of Scripture. Jesus' declaration, "I and my Father are one," was made to mean, "Every man and
woman is God." And Vivekananda was quite willing himself to be worshiped. His fundamental error,
indeed, was his lack of the sense of sin. He said to his audience in Chicago: "The Hindus refuse
to call you sinners. Ye divinities on earth, sinners? It is a sin to call a man so. It is a
standing libel on human nature." Yet, in spite of this deification of self and of all humanity,
he did much to inspire pity for the poor, to awaken India to self-consciousness, and to give
hope of national unity.

This is an atom: 
We must not ignore the work of The Theosophical Society, though it has made a name for itself
more in Europe and America than in India. While it has done something to encourage education
and to teach modern science, it has used the knowledge thus given as an instrument in defending
superstition. The immoralities of Krishna are discussed and palliated in Mrs. Besant's Magazine
for the instruction of young students. Charms, incantations, astrology, idolatry, caste, are
all woven into the system, for the sake of propitiating the Indian mind, so that its influence
is hostile to Christianity and to missions. Idols are to be worshiped because they are "centers
of magnetism." In England Mrs. Besant predicts a second advent of Christ. But in India this
becomes a new avatar of Krishna. In spite of her stout denunciation of child-marriages and
her inculcation of modern science, her propaganda has not been so much a reform of Indian religion,
as it has been a hindrance to reform. Hindu devotees indeed have eulogized her for what they
call her successful opposition to the proselyting efforts of Christian missionaries.

This is an atom: 
And yet, even the Theosophical Society, with all its absurdities of levitation and the astral
body, has been compelled to bear some witness to Jesus Christ. He is "the light that lighteth
every man," and he has given even to this system some elements of truth. We do not hesitate
to recognize the truth that Buddha and Confucius, taught, and to regard it as a ray of Christ's
light shed forth before the rising of the sun. And it is our privilege to conclude our list
of Hindu reformers with the name of Justice Renade, who recognized in Christ the source of
all former revelations of God.

This is an atom: 
Justice Renade, in his social reform movement of the last fifty years, has carried the spirit
of philanthropy into practice, more fully than did Vivekananda or Mrs. Besant, and without
any of their fantastic self-exaltation. Renade recognized the elements of truth in both the
Hindu and Moslem systems, and he saw in Christianity the influence destined to unite them.
He would not throw away the old, but he would utilize it while he added the new. And with this
acknowledgment that "he who is not against us is on our side," we may well close our sketch
of reformers before the reformation. We sum up the lessons of history when we recognize in
Hinduism the two great ideas of divine immanence and incarnation, in Mohammedanism the two
equally essential truths of divine transcendence and personality. And we see the absolute dependence
of India upon Christianity for its true Reformation. India needs the missionary more than she
needs the schoolmaster. Let us pray that she may have a religious revival that shall turn the
intellectual awakening into moral channels. That religious revival will furnish a center of
unity in Christ, the one and only Revealer of God; not in a Hindu philosophy, nor in a Moslem
Koran, but in a living Person, present with all his people, the soul of their soul and the
life, and imparting to them his own Spirit of love and brotherhood. In Christ alone can India's
renaissance become a complete reformation.

MISSIONS AND SCRIPTURE

This is an atom: 
The world of scholars has recently been startled by the pretended discovery that the "Great
Commission," "Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations," is not an utterance
of Jesus himself, but only one attributed to him by some enthusiastic follower of his in a
later time. This pretended discovery is on a par with the earlier one that there never was
such a person as Jesus at all, but that his personality is simply a myth that gradually grew
up in the minds of some Jewish fanatics who sought a fulfilment of Messianic prophecy. We might
treat these perverse and subversive conclusions as only curious instances of a wrong method
of criticism. But they filter down from the scholars to the masses of Christian believers and
weaken their faith. It becomes a duty to deal with the method which leads to such results,
and threatens to destroy all our missionary zeal. Hence I proceed to test the value of the
method itself, even though it is commonly called "the historical method" by those who adopt
it. If we can bear a somewhat roundabout way of treating the subject, we shall gain a new and
valuable light upon our missionary theory and practice.

This is an atom: 
To prevent misunderstanding, however, I must premise that it is the historical method as frequently
employed, and not the historical method as it ought to be, to which I offer my objections.
My criticism is directed against the historical method, only when it assumes to be the exclusive
means of attaining truth, follows the methods of physical science, and ignores the far more
important material for religious use which is furnished by intuition and revelation. The phrase
"historical method" has come to imply much that does not properly belong to it. I criticize
only its frequent exclusiveness and exaggeration. And I do this, as I think, in the interest
of true science.

This is an atom: 
There are two methods of reasoning possible, in this case or in any other case, and there are
only two--I mean the deductive, and the inductive. I make no mention of argument from analogy,
for that proceeds upon a deductive basis, presuming that there is a designed order in the world
which makes analogy possible. The deductive method argues from the universal to the particular,
from the higher to the lower, from God to man. The inductive method, on the other hand, argues
from the particular to the universal, from the lower to the higher, from man to God. Both of
these methods are correct when each is taken in connection with the other. Much depends, however,
upon the question which is taken first. Shall we begin with the particular, leaving out for
the time all thought of the universal? There is danger that induction will come to be regarded
as itself sufficient to lead us into the truth. This is a serious error, for correct induction
presupposes deduction, and therefore deduction should be the guiding principle and safeguard
of induction. If this is forgotten, induction may go fearfully astray.

This is an atom: 
To make my meaning still more plain, let me say that in our investigations we need a comprehensive
method, a method that will look at facts from more than one point of view. A truly historical
method will look at facts from above, as well as from each side, and so the deductive process
may be popularly described as vertical. The historical method falsely so called errs in confining
its view to what can be seen immediately around it, and so its process is exclusively horizontal.
Deduction begins vertically, and makes that which comes from above to be its guide and standard
in all inductive work. Induction begins horizontally, and tends to become self-sufficient,
until all light from above seems untrustworthy and useless. For example, take the study of
nature. If one begins, inductively and horizontally, with mere physical and material order,
instead of beginning, deductively and vertically, with man's higher powers of conscience and
will, he will end by finding only impersonal force in the universe, and by practically deifying
it, as the Hindus deified Brahma. Begin rightly, and, with due care in the application of the
deductive principle, he will come to right conclusions. There are certain truths which cannot
be reached by induction. They are known by intuition, long before induction begins. The most
fundamental of these truths is the truth of God's existence. A Power above us, which has moral
perfection, and which claims our obedience, is revealed to every man by conscience. Begin with
this knowledge, and to the obedient spirit the physical world seems ablaze with evidences of
wisdom and love; the regularities of nature are recognized as God's methods of ordinary operation;
evolution is only his usual plan of growth and progress; in other words, God's transcendence
is manifest as well as his immanence, his personality as well as his revelation in the forces
of the universe.

This is an atom: 
Man is a theist, before he becomes a Christian. Theism is a universal intuition, ready to assert
itself in practice wherever it is not prevented by an evil will from its normal manifestation.
But, because man is in an abnormal condition, this normal action of his powers can be restored
only by the Holy Spirit. "When he is come," says our Lord, "he will convince the world of sin,
because they believe not on me," and "of righteousness, because I go unto the Father." Only
when the prodigal repented, did he "come to himself," and begin to act normally. Under the
influence of the Spirit, God's holiness reveals to man his sin, and God's love leads him to
the feet of Jesus. This is the first step in Christian experience. To put my doctrine unmistakably
and in a nutshell, deduction from the existence of God normally precedes and insures the acceptance
of Christ. The sinner comes to have personal knowledge of One who has atoned, and therefore
can forgive. But to him who has accepted Christ, his Lord is more than a historical Redeemer,
he is a present Saviour from both the penalty and the power of sin. Without this personal knowledge
of Christ, we might think of him as only one of many human examples or teachers, like Confucius
or Buddha. Now, he is nothing less than God manifest in the flesh, omnipresent, omniscient,
omnipotent, whom having seen we have seen the Father.

This is an atom: 
But there is a second step in Christian experience, which I wish also to describe in a nutshell
and to define as unmistakably as I described and defined the first. I claim that deduction
from the existence of Christ normally precedes and insures the acceptance of Scripture. Our
Lord himself has said, "My sheep hear my voice." The Christian recognizes in Scripture the
voice of Christ. No change in his experience is more marked and wonderful than the change in
his estimate of the Bible. A little time ago, Scripture was commonplace and unmeaning. Now
it speaks to him with a living voice such words of instruction and comfort, of warning and
promise, that his soul is filled alternately with sorrow and with joy. He wonders that he never
saw these things before. He perceives for the first time that he has been in an abnormal condition
of mind, and that condition has been due to his own perversity of will. But now the prodigal
has "come to himself." Only the Holy Spirit could have made possible this new and normal exercise
of his powers. The change is not in the Scripture, it is in himself. He has come in contact
with a word of God that "liveth and abideth." He sees in it the divine workmanship. He can
no longer regard Scripture as merely the work of man; it is also the work of the same Spirit
who has transformed him, namely, the eternal Christ. Christ is the author and inspirer of Scripture,
even though imperfect human agents have been employed to communicate his revelation. In spite
of the rudeness and diversity of the instruments, there breathes through them all a certain
divine melody and harmony. While the inductive and horizontal method would give us only finite
and earthly truth, the deductive and vertical can give us truth that is infinite and eternal.
The indispensable condition of success in the interpretation of Scripture is therefore a hearty
belief that the Bible is Christ's revelation of God, and not merely a series of gropings after
truth on the part of men. Deduction will give us truth from above, whereas induction will give
us only scattered facts on the horizontal plane.

This is an atom: 
I am convinced that the so-called "historical method" of Scripture interpretation, as it is
usually employed, fails to secure correct results, because it proceeds wholly by induction,
leaving out of its account the knowledge of Christ which comes to the Christian in his personal
experience. I do not regard such a "historical method" as really historical; I deny that it
discovers the original meaning of the documents; I claim that, when made the sole avenue of
approach to truth, it leads to false views of doctrine. It assumes at the outset that what
rules in the realm of physics rules also in the moral and religious realm. But the Christian
has learned that Christ is the supreme source of truth. By a process of either conscious or
unconscious deduction he recognizes in Scripture the utterance of Christ. He must begin his
investigations with one of two assumptions: Is the Bible only man's word? or, Is it also Christ's
word? Is it a mere product of human intelligence? or, Is it also the product of a divine intelligence,
who indeed uses human and imperfect means of communication, but who nevertheless at sundry
times and in divers manners has brought to the world the knowledge of salvation?

This is an atom: 
I claim that we should begin by assuming that the Bible is a revelation of Christ. This assertion
is justified, as I have already intimated, by our Christian experience. That experience has
given us a knowledge of the heart, more valuable in religious things than any mere knowledge
of the intellect. Doctor Tholuck, in an address to his students at his fiftieth anniversary,
said that God's greatest gift to him had been the knowledge of sin. Without that conviction
of sin which the Spirit of Christ can work in the human heart, there can be no proper understanding
of Scripture, for Scripture is a revelation to sinners. The opening of the heart to receive
Christ, and the new sense of his pardoning grace and power, give to the converted man the key
to the interpretation of Scripture, for "the mystery of the gospel," the central secret of
Christianity, is "Christ in you, the hope of glory." He whom the Holy Spirit has first led
to the knowledge of sin, and has then led to the acceptance of Christ, is prepared to enter
into the meaning of Scripture, and no other man can understand it.

This is an atom: 
This was the way in which Paul came to understand Scripture. It was not by criticism of the
documents, but by receiving Christ, that "the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in
the face of Jesus Christ" entered into his soul. He knew himself to be the chief of sinners.
He knew Christ as his manifested God and Saviour. He applied to Christ all that the Old Testament
had revealed with regard to the dealings of God with his chosen people. The light that shone
upon him on the way to Damascus was the Shekinah that led Israel in the pillar of cloud by
day and of fire by night, that dwelt over the mercy-seat in the tabernacle and in the temple,
and that thundered and lightened from Sinai in the giving of the Law. "The Rock that followed
them" in the wilderness, and gave water to the thirsty, "that Rock was Christ." And so Paul
came to know Jesus Christ as preexistent and omnipresent, as Redeemer of the whole world, Gentile
as well as Jew; and Christ's Cross became the embodiment and symbol of God's amazing sorrow
for human sin, and of his sacrifice for its cure. All Paul's later conclusions were developments
and expressions of his initial knowledge of Christ. It was a deductive and not an inductive
process, by which he arrived at his theology.

This is an atom: 
Lest any Christian should say that the deductive method is impracticable to him, for the reason
that he has had no such revelation of Christ to start from as that which was given to Paul,
Scripture reports to us the very different experience of another apostle. I refer to Peter.
Peter shows us how, by this same deductive method, an experience which at its beginning is
very small, may in the end become very great. Peter goes to the banks of Jordan, a sinner,
seeking pardon for his sin. John the Baptist points him to Jesus, "Behold the Lamb of God,
who taketh away the sin of the world." Peter knows nothing of Jesus' deity, nor of his atonement.
But, by an instinct which is the best of logic, he is drawn to Jesus, as the one who can satisfy
his needs. He becomes a Christian, that is, a follower of Jesus. His experience is a sort of
caterpillar; it can creep, but it cannot soar. Yet all the elements of growth are in it. Peter
begins to analyze it. What right has he to surrender himself, body and soul, to a man like
himself? The answer is: Jesus is more than man. At Cæsarea Philippi, Peter cries, "Thou art
the Christ, the son of the living God." On the day of Pentecost, he preaches Christ as the
Saviour exalted to God's right hand. And finally, in his Epistles, he declares the preexistence
of Christ, and the fact of Christ's utterances through the prophets as far back in time as
the days of Noah. If our higher critics only adopted Peter's method, analyzed their own experience,
following on to know their Lord and meantime willing to do his will, they too, like Peter,
in spite of small beginnings, would learn of Jesus' doctrine, would emerge from the caterpillar
state, would be soaring instead of creeping, and would end by gladly confessing that he who
met them on the way in their first experience was none other than the omnipresent Christ, whom
Paul describes as God manifest in the flesh, in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead
bodily. They would also learn, with Peter, that Scripture is the work and word of the preexistent
Christ.

This is an atom: 
Because this experience of sin and of Christ is knowledge, it is material for science, for
science is only unified knowledge. I do not deny that it is knowledge peculiar to the Christian.
The princes of physics and literature and government have not known it. It is not the wisdom
of this world, but it is better, even the very wisdom of God. I glory in Christian theology,
as the science that will last, when all systems of merely physical science have passed away.
For the man who has been saved by Christ has knowledge of him who is Creator, Upholder, and
Life of all. I do not hesitate to say that the only safe interpreter of physical nature is
the true Christian, for it is Christ "in whom all things consist." The true Christian is the
only safe interpreter of history, for it is Christ who "upholds all things by the word of his
power." And so, the true Christian is the only safe interpreter of Scripture, for it is Christ
whose Spirit in the prophets "testified beforehand of his sufferings, and of the glories that
should follow them." In him who is the Lord of all "are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
hidden." Only when one is joined to Christ, can he understand the evolutionary process through
which Christ has led the human race, or understand the Bible which constitutes the historical
record of that process. With the Psalmist we may say, "In thy light shall we see light."

This is an atom: 
As Christ is the central object of knowledge in Christian experience, it follows that Christians
recognize him as the primary author of Scripture. They find him speaking to them in the Bible,
as in no other book. It becomes to them the word of God, given by divine inspiration, and able
to make them wise unto salvation. From the deity and supremacy of Christ they proceed to faith
in the unity, the sufficiency, and the authority of Scripture, and this determines their method
of investigation. From the person of Christ to the word of Christ is a process often unconscious,
but one better than any process of formal logic. Knowing their divine Saviour, they know the
divinity of his word. His presence in human history and in the hearts of the righteous has
given _unity_ to his continuous revelation. The Scripture "cannot be broken," or interpreted
as a promiscuous congeries of separate bits; for a divine intelligence and life throb through
the whole collection. Like railway coupons, its texts are "not good if detached." We must interpret
each text by its context, each part by the whole, the preparation of salvation by the fulfilment,
and all the diverse contents by him who weaves all together, even Christ, the end of the law,
to whom all the preliminaries point. This method gives room for the most thorough investigation
of the times and ways of revelation, for recognizing the imperfection of beginnings and the
variety of the product. The Bible is a gradually accumulated literature, Hebraic in form, but
universal in spirit. The preexistent Christ has made all this literature one, by the influence
in the sacred writers of his omnipresent Spirit. If the "historical method" would begin with
this postulate of a unifying Christ, its method would be more safe and its results more sure.

This is an atom: 
Faith in an eternal and omnipresent Christ guarantees also the _sufficiency_ of Scripture.
Here, however, there is an obvious limitation. Scripture is not sufficient for all the kinds
and purposes of human science. It will not tell us the configuration of the hinder side of
the moon, nor reveal the future uses of electricity. It is not with such things that Scripture
deals. But in religious matters, such as our relation to God and salvation, it is sufficient
as a rule of faith and practice. We may find in it all needful models and helps in the divine
life, as well as all needful directions about the way to begin it. The church of Christ has
always found in the Bible a safe guide for her polity and conduct, and civil government has
prospered when the principles of Scripture were followed by the powers that ruled the State.
Because the Christian believes the Bible to be the product of men inspired by Christ, he can
send it out by the million copies as equal to the moral and spiritual needs of the world.

This is an atom: 
And because Christ is, through his imperfect agents, the real author of Scripture, we believe
in its absolute _authority_. When rightly interpreted, however. It will never do to treat poetry
as if it were prose, or drama as if it were history, or allegory as if it were fact. Christ
can use, and he has used, all the common methods of literary composition, and he expects us
to use common sense in dealing with them. But out of the whole can be evolved a consistent
doctrine and an authoritative law. The one and only way of salvation is plainly that of faith
in God's provision of pardon and life in Christ. In spite of many divergences, the great body
of Christians throughout the ages have agreed in their recognition of the personality and the
deity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; of the incarnation and the atonement of
Christ; of his resurrection and his lordship; of his omnipresence with his people even to the
end of the world. They have expressed this agreement in the Apostles' Creed and in the hymnology
of the church. But the great body of instructed Christians also believe in Christ as the Revealer
of God in nature and in history; as "the Light that lighteth every man" in conscience and tradition;
and as the righteous Judge who accepts in every nation those who fear God and work righteousness,
casting themselves as sinners upon the divine mercy even though they do not yet know that this
divine mercy is only another name for Christ. The Bible, as a whole and when rightly interpreted,
is absolute authority, because it is the word of Christ; and Christ holds each of us, as individuals,
to the duty and the privilege of interpreting the Bible for himself.

This is an atom: 
It seems to me plain that this method of interpreting Scripture in the light of the Christian's
experience of Christ, is not "the historical method," as it is usually employed. This latter
method seems to ignore the relation of Scripture to Christ, and to proceed in its investigations
as if there were no preexistent Christ to furnish its principle. It insists upon treating Scripture
as it would treat any unreligious or heathen literature, and with no relation to its divine
authorship. It sees in Scripture only a promiscuous collection of disjointed documents, with
no living tie to bind them together, and no significance beyond that of the time in which they
were written. It would treat the Bible as a man-made book, or rather, as a man-made series
of books, regardless of the fact that the plural "biblia," which once represented the thought
of the church, has, under the influence of the divine Spirit, become "biblion" or Bible, a
singular, and a proof that Christian consciousness has not been satisfied with rationalistic
explanations, but has followed its natural impulses by attributing unity to the word of Christ
its Saviour. The separate "words" have been felt to constitute the one "word of God," an organic
whole, which fitly represents the eternal "Word," of whom it is the voice and expression. Scripture
is not a congeries of earth-born fragments, but an organism, pulsating with divine life. The
"historical method" of which I speak can never find that life, because it works only on the
physical and horizontal plane, ignoring the light which comes deductively from above, and also
the darkening and blinding influences which often operate unconsciously from below.

SCRIPTURE AND MISSIONS

This is an atom: 
The "historical method" of Scripture interpretation, as it is often employed, ends without
Christ, because it begins without him. One of its fundamental principles is that each passage
of Scripture is to be interpreted solely in the light of the knowledge and intent of the person
who wrote it. The One Hundred and Tenth Psalm, for example, can have no reference to Christ,
because the writer knew no other than the Jewish king whose accession and whose power he anticipates.
The Psalm reads, "Jehovah said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool." The so-called historical critics would make any interpretation of this
passage as a designed prophecy of Christ to be an unwarranted accommodation of it to a meaning
which it did not originally bear, and the conclusion is that we are wrong in citing these words
as an Old Testament assertion of Christ's deity. But, unfortunately for this method of interpretation,
we have, in the Gospels of Matthew and of Mark, our Lord's own reference of this passage, not
simply to some Jewish ruler of olden time, but to the coming Messiah, and since he was himself
the Messiah, he refers it by implication to himself. He does not deny, but rather grants, a
primary reference of the psalm to a son of David, for David was a king, and his son would be
a king. But he also sees in the psalm a prophecy that this son of David would be a king whom
David would call Lord. His searching examination propounds to the unbelieving Jews the question,
"What think ye of the Christ? whose son is he?" And they say, "The Son of David." He answers
them by asking, "How then doth David, in the Spirit, call him Lord?" In other words, inspiration
declares Messiah to be a King of kings, and a Lord of lords. Since the whole discussion is
one with regard to the nature and claims of the Messiah, and since the Messiah is not a mere
man like David, but is seated on the throne with Jehovah and is David's Lord, Christ's answer
is an assertion of his own deity. His answer antedates, even if it did not suggest, Paul's
later description of Christ, as "declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead." But the higher critics differ in opinion
from the Lord Jesus. They extricate themselves from their difficulty by suggesting that Jesus,
like other men, was subject to the errors of his time. And so, not only Christ's knowledge
of Scripture and his authority as its interpreter are denied, but also his knowledge of his
own nature and place in the universe. If his knowledge of things so essential be denied, what
trust can we place in any other of his utterances? To those who reason in this way, Christ
cannot possibly be divine--he is only a fallible man, self-deceived, and so, deceiving others.
The fault of the critics lies in their presupposition. They have begun wrongly, by leaving
out the primary fact in the subject they investigate, namely, that the preincarnate Christ
was the author and inspirer of the Scripture which he afterward interpreted. He used human
agents, with their natural language and surroundings, as his instruments, but he could, on
the way to Emmaus, "beginning from Moses and all the prophets," interpret to those humble believers
"in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself." Scripture can have, and it does have,
two authors, man and God, the writer and Christ; and to ignore Christ in the evolution of the
Bible is to miss its chief meaning, to teach falsehood instead of truth, and, consciously or
unconsciously, to deny Christ's deity.

Cannot a document have more than one author? What are the facts in other realms of art? In
painting, did not Landseer get Millais to paint the human figure into the picture of his dogs?
In literature, is there any more acknowledged fact than that Erckmann-Chatrian's battle-stories
were the work of two writers, and not of one? The work of a single author may have two separate
meanings, for Dante declares that his Divine Comedy has one meaning that is personal, and another
meaning that is universal. Our extreme critics are as poor students of literature as they are
of life. Their narrowness of interpretation is due to a narrowness of experience. If they knew
Christ better, they would find in the Twenty-third Psalm alone enough proof to upset their
theory. "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want," is an utterance inexplicable by merely
human authorship. To suppose that even a king of Israel who had been a shepherd-boy could have
written this psalm without divine inspiration, in a day when all lands but little Palestine
were wrapt in a pall of heathen darkness, is to suppose that religion can exist and flourish
without a God.

"The testimony of Jesus," says the book of Revelation, "is the spirit of prophecy." It was
the recognition of constant references to Christ in the Old Testament, that enabled the apostles
to convince and convert the unbelieving Jews. The absence of this recognition is the secret
of all the minimizing of Christ's attributes which is so rife in our day. Do men believe in
Christ's deity who ignore his promise to be with them to the end of the world, and who refuse
to address him in prayer? Could one of these modern interpreters have taken the place of Philip,
when he met the Ethiopian eunuch? That dignitary had been reading the prophecy of Isaiah, "He
was led as a lamb to the slaughter." "Of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of
some other?" "And Philip opened his mouth, and preached unto him _Jesus._" Our modern critics
call this an unwarranted interpretation, because Isaiah had no knowledge of Christ. And yet,
John tells us that "Isaiah saw his glory, and spake of him." The critics contradict John again,
when they say that we must put no meaning into Isaiah's words but that of his own time. His
great prophecy of a suffering Messiah, they say, had reference only to Jehoiachin, the captive
king of Judah, or to the whole Jewish nation as the afflicted people of God. Philip and the
critics are evidently at variance. If we accept their method, we shall lose all reference in
the Old Testament to the atonement of Christ, and all proof that the sacrifice on Calvary was
that of "the Lamb slain from before the foundation of the world." Reverse the process, and
we can still say,

It is needless to multiply instances of this failure to interpret the Old Testament aright.
Let me call attention to the effect of this method upon the interpretation of the New Testament,
for the authority of the New Testament is also undermined. The system of typical interpretation,
which sees in Christ the reality prefigured in Old Testament shadows, is discredited as unscientific.
The whole Epistle to the Hebrews is thrown out, as a poetical clothing of "the man of Nazareth"
with the fading glories of an outworn worship. The idea that the high priest of old who entered
the Holy of Holies once a year not without blood, and the whole Jewish system of which this
formed the central feature, were a divinely ordered prefiguration of Christ's atoning sacrifice
for the sins of men--this idea is called a mere human addition to historical truth. Christ
is no longer our great High Priest. His priesthood is mere metaphor, without divine warrant
or authority. He is not our Prophet, nor our King, for his prophecies are not fulfilled, and
his kingdom is only that of a moral teacher and example. And all this, in spite of the fact
that the Epistle to the Hebrews bears upon its front the declaration that "God, who in past
times spoke to the fathers through the prophets, has in these last days spoken through his
Son," whom this same Epistle then proceeds to describe as the effulgence of God's glory and
the very image of his substance, the Creator, Upholder, and Redeemer of the world, the same
yesterday, to-day, and forever.

This is an atom: 
I do not undervalue the historical method, when it is kept free from this agnostic presupposition
that only man is the author of Scripture. This method has given us some information as to the
authorship of the sacred books, and it has in some degree helped in their interpretation. I
am free to acknowledge my own obligation to it. I grant the composite documentary view of the
Pentateuch and of its age-long days of creation, while I still hold to its substantially Mosaic
authorship. I say this, however, with deference, for a university president of note, when asked
about the stories of Cain and Abel, replied that no such persons in all probability ever lived,
but that the account was still valuable, since it taught the great moral lesson that it is
highly improper for a man to murder his brother! I grant that there may be more than one Isaiah,
while yet I see in the later Isaiah a continuance of the divine revelation given through the
earlier. Any honest Christian, I would say, has the right to interpret Jonah and Daniel as
allegories, rather than as histories. I can look upon the book of Job as a drama, while I still
assert that Job was a historical character. I can see in the Song of Solomon the celebration
of a pure human love, while at the same time I claim that the Song had divinely injected into
it the meaning that union with Christ is the goal and climax of all human passion. In short,
I take the historical method as my servant and not my master; as partially but not wholly revealing
the truth; as showing me, not how man made the Scripture for himself, but how God made the
Scripture through the imperfect agency of man. So I find _unity_ in the Scriptures, because
they are the work of the omnipresent and omniscient Christ: I find _sufficiency_ in the Scriptures,
because they satisfy every religious need of the individual and of the church; I find _authority_
in the Scriptures, because, though coming through man, they are, when taken together and rightly
interpreted, the veritable word of God. I denounce the historical method, only when it claims
to be the solely valid method of reaching truth, and so, leaves out the primary agency and
determining influence of Christ.

This is an atom: 
What sort of systematic theology is left us, when the perverted historical method is made the
only clue to the labyrinth of Scripture? There is but one answer: No such thing as systematic
theology is possible. Science is knowledge, and to have a system you must have unified knowledge.
The historical method so called can see no unity in Scripture, because it does not carry with
it the primary knowledge of Christ. It simply applies in its investigations the principles
of physical science. Physical science begins with the outward and visible, not with the inward
and spiritual, with matter and not with mind. Laplace swept the heavens with his telescope,
but he said that he nowhere found a God. He might just as well have swept his kitchen with
a broom, and then complained that he could not find God there. God is not stars, nor dust.
God is spirit, and he is not to be apprehended by the senses. Laplace should have taken man's
conscience and will for his starting-point. And just as physical science can find no God in
the universe by the use of the forceps and the microscope, so this historical method can find
no Christ in the Scriptures, because it looks there for only human agency. The result is that
it finds only a collection of seemingly contradictory fragments, with no divine Spirit to harmonize
them and bind them together. Its method is purely inductive, whereas its induction should always
be guided by a knowledge of Christ, gained before investigation begins, and furnishing the
basis for a deductive process as well. Differentiation and not harmonization is its rule, and
this makes its criticism destructive rather than constructive. Many a passage is set aside,
because it will not fit in with a skeptical interpretation. Christ's own words with regard
to his being "a ransom for many," and with regard to his having "all power committed to him
in heaven and in earth," are held to be later words attributed to him by his followers. The
whole New Testament story comes to be regarded as a mythical growth, like that which gradually
placed haloes about the heads of the apostles. The Gospel of John is not accepted as historical,
but is said to be a work of the second century. Jesus, it is said, never himself claimed to
be the Messiah, since it is only John who reports his saying to the woman of Samaria, "I that
speak unto thee am he." Paul is set aside, as being the author of a rabbinical theology which
has no claim upon us; and that, in spite of Christ's own declaration that there were many things
which he could not teach while he was here in the flesh, but which he would teach, by his Spirit,
after his resurrection, and ascension.

This is an atom: 
Prof. Kirsopp Lake, in a recent address before the Harvard Divinity School, deprecated the
use of the term "theology." "Theology," he said, "presupposes divine revelation, which we do
not accept." He proposed the term "philosophy," as expressive of the aim of the Unitarian school.
This is honest and plain. What shall we say of those who speak of the "new emphasis" needed
in modern theology, when they really mean that the preaching of the old doctrines of sin and
salvation must give place to "another gospel" of cooperative Christian work? From their neglect
to put any further emphasis upon "the faith once for all delivered to the saints," we can only
infer that, for their structure of doctrine, no other foundation than philosophy is needed,
and that they, like the Unitarians, no longer accept the fact of a divine revelation. "Other
foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ," and to lay greater
emphasis upon the fruits of Christianity than upon its roots, is to insult Christ, and ultimately
to make Christianity itself only one of many earth-born religions, powerless like them either
to save the individual soul or to redeem society. Professor Lake is quite right: If there is
no divine revelation, there can be, not only no systematic theology, but no theology at all.

This is an atom: 
What is the effect of this method upon our theological seminaries? It is to deprive the gospel
message of all definiteness, and to make professors and students disseminators of doubts. Many
a professor has found teaching preferable to preaching, because he lacked the initial Christian
experience which gives to preaching its certainty and power. He chooses the line of least resistance,
and becomes in the theological seminary a blind leader of the blind. Having no system of truth
to teach, he becomes a mere lecturer on the history of doctrine. Having no key in Christ to
the unity of Scripture, he becomes a critic of what he is pleased to call its fragments, that
is, the dissector of a cadaver. Ask him if he believes in the preexistence, deity, virgin birth,
miracles, atoning death, physical resurrection, omnipresence, and omnipotence of Christ, and
he denies your right to require of him any statement of his own beliefs. He does not conceive
it to be his duty to furnish his students with any fixed conclusions as to doctrine but only
to aid them in coming to conclusions for themselves. The apostle Paul was not so reticent.
He was not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, but rather gloried in it. He even pronounced his
anathema upon any who taught other doctrine. It is no wonder that our modern critics cry, "Back
to Christ," for this means, "Away from Paul." The result of such teaching in our seminaries
is that the student, unless he has had a Pauline experience before he came, has all his early
conceptions of Scripture and of Christian doctrine weakened, has no longer any positive message
to deliver, loses the ardor of his love for Christ, and at his graduation leaves the seminary,
not to become preacher or pastor as he had once hoped, but to sow his doubts broadcast, as
teacher in some college, as editor of some religious journal, as secretary of some Young Men's
Christian Association, or as agent of some mutual life insurance company. This method of interpretation
switches off upon some side-track of social service many a young man who otherwise would be
a heroic preacher of the everlasting gospel. The theological seminaries of almost all our denominations
are becoming so infected with this grievous error, that they are not so much organs of Christ,
as they are organs of Antichrist. This accounts for the rise, all over the land, of Bible schools,
to take the place of the seminaries. The evil is coming in like a flood, and the Spirit of
the Lord will surely raise up a standard against it. But oh the pity! that money given by godly
men to provide preachers of the gospel should be devoted to undermining the Christian cause!

This is an atom: 
What is the effect of this method of interpretation upon the churches of our denomination?
It is to cut the tap-root of their strength, and to imperil their very existence. Baptist churches
are founded upon Scripture. Their doctrine of regenerate church-membership, and of church ordinances
as belonging only to believers, presupposes an authoritative rule of faith and practice in
the New Testament. In controversy with other denominations we have always appealed "to the
law and to the testimony," and we have declared that, if other faiths "speak not according
to this word, surely there is no morning for them." We have held that the authority of Scripture
is not an arbitrary authority, but that the ordinances have so much of meaning that to change
their form is to destroy them altogether. We stand for immersion as the only real baptism,
not because much water is better than little water, but because baptism is the symbol of Christ's
death, burial, and resurrection, and the symbol also of our spiritual death, burial, and resurrection
with him. When we are "buried with him in baptism," we show forth his death, just as we show
forth his death in the Lord's Supper. To change the form of the Lord's Supper so as to leave
out all reference to the breaking of Christ's body and the shedding of his blood, would be
to break down one great visible monument and testimony to Christ's atoning death, and to destroy
the Lord's Supper itself. And to change the form of baptism so as to leave out its symbolism
of Christ's death, burial, and resurrection, is to break down another great visible monument
and testimony to Christ's essential work, and to destroy the ordinance of baptism. Only the
surrender of belief in the authority of Scripture, and a consequent ignoring of the meaning
of baptism can explain the proposal to give us our requisition of immersion. The weakness of
our denomination in such cities as New York results from the acceptance of the method of Scripture
interpretation which I have been criticizing. We are losing our faith in the Bible, and our
determination to stand for its teachings. We are introducing into our ministry men who either
never knew the Lord, or who have lost their faith in him and their love for him. The unbelief
in our seminary teaching is like a blinding mist which is slowly settling down upon our churches,
and is gradually abolishing, not only all definite views of Christian doctrine, but also all
conviction of duty to "contend earnestly for the faith" of our fathers. So we are giving up
our polity, to please and to join other denominations. If this were only a lapse in denominationalism,
we might call it a mere change in our ways of expressing faith. But it is a far more radical
evil. It is apostasy from Christ and revolt against his government. It is refusal to rally
to Christ's colors in the great conflict with error and sin. We are ceasing to be evangelistic
as well as evangelical, and if this downward progress continues, we shall in due time cease
to exist. This is the fate of Unitarianism to-day. We Baptists must reform, or die.

This is an atom: 
What is the effect of this method of interpretation upon missions? I have just come from an
extensive tour in mission fields. I have visited missionaries of several denominations. I have
found those missions most successful which have held to the old gospel and to the polity of
the New Testament. But I have found a growing tendency to depend upon education, rather than
upon evangelism. What would Peter have said on the day of Pentecost, if you had advised him
not to incur the wrath of the Jews by his preaching, but to establish schools, and to trust
to the gradual enlightenment of the Jewish nation by means of literature? He might have replied
that our Lord made it his first duty to "make disciples," and only afterwards to "teach them
to observe all things which he had commanded." Christian schools and Christian teaching are
necessary in their place, but they are second, not first. Our lack at home of the right interpretation
of Scripture, and our fading knowledge in experience of the presence and power of Christ, have
gone from us round the world. Some boards are sending out as missionaries young men who lack
definite views of doctrine. These young men, having nothing positive to preach, choose rather
to teach in the English language, in schools where English is spoken, rather than preach in
the native language which requires a lifetime of study. When they teach, they cannot help revealing
their mental poverty, and disturbing the simple faith of their pupils. Having no certainty
themselves, they can inspire no certainty in others, for "if the trumpet gives no certain sound,
who will arm himself for the battle?" These unprepared and inefficient teachers may become
themselves converted through their very sense of weakness in presence of the towering systems
of idolatry and superstition around them. But if they are not so converted, they will handicap
the mission and paralyze its influence. Some of our best missionaries have said to me, "The
Lord deliver us from such helpers!" No man has a right to go, and no board has a right to send,
as a missionary, one who has not had such a personal experience of Christ as will enable him
to stand against this unscientific and unchristian method of Scripture interpretation.

This is an atom: 
This so-called "historical method" has effects on the missionary cause at home, as well as
in the lands far away. "How shall they preach, except they be sent?" The sending of missionaries
is dependent upon the zeal and liberality of the churches in our land. But how can one who
is not sure that Jesus ever uttered the words of the Great Commission urge the churches to
fulfil that command of Christ? How can one who has never felt his own need of an atonement
adjure his brethren, by Christ's death for their sins, not to let the heathen perish? How can
one who has had no experience of Christ as a present and divine Saviour, have power to stand
against the rationalism and apathy of the church? This method of Scripture interpretation makes
evangelism an enterprise of fanatics not sufficiently educated to know that Buddha and Confucius
were teachers of truth long before the time of Christ. Can we more surely dry up the sources
of missionary contributions, than by yielding to the pernicious influence of this way of treating
Scripture? We have gone far already in the wrong direction. Our churches are honeycombed with
doubt and with indifference. The preaching of the old gospel of sin and salvation seems almost
a thing of the past. People have itching ears that will not endure sound doctrine. The dynamic
of missions is love for Christ, who died to save us from the guilt and power of sin. Modern
criticism has to a large extent nullified this dynamic, and if the authority of Scripture is
yet further weakened, we may look for complete collapse in our supplies both of men and of
money. In fact, the faith and the gifts of many converts from among the heathen already so
far exceed the average faith and gifts of our churches at home, that the time may come when
Burma and the Congo may have to send missionaries to us, as we are now sending missionaries
to the land where the seven churches of Asia once flourished.

This is an atom: 
Whence has come this so-called "historical method" of interpreting Scripture? I answer: It
was "made in Germany." German scholarship for a century past has been working almost exclusively
on the horizontal plane, and has been ignoring the light that comes from above. The theology
of Great Britain and of America has been profoundly affected by the application of its evolutionary
and skeptical principles. In Germany itself the honesty of every Scripture writer has been
questioned, and every sacred document has been torn into bits. When the all-pervading presence
and influence of Christ in the Bible is lost sight of, and its separate fragments are examined
to discover their meaning, there is no guide but the theory of evolution; and evolution, instead
of being the ordinary method of a personal God, is itself personified and made the only power
in the universe. The regularities of nature, it is thought, leave no room for miracle. There
is no divine Will that can work down upon nature in unique acts, such as incarnation and resurrection.
A pantheistic Force is the only ruler, and whatever is, is right. Goethe led the way in this
pagan philosophy, and German universities have been full of it ever since. It is painful to
see how German theologians and ministers have been won over to the ethics of brute force and
the practical, deification of mere might in human affairs. The New Testament has been interpreted
as justifying implicit obedience to "the powers that be," even when they turn the Kaiser into
a military despot and his people into unresisting and deluded slaves. An exaggerated nationalism
has taken the place of human solidarity, and a selfish domination of the world has become the
goal of national ambition. All the atrocities of this war might have been spared us, if the
nations of which Germany is the most conspicuous offender had derived their ethics and their
practice from the divine love which rules above, rather than from the seeming necessity of
competing with the nations around them. A new interpretation of Scripture is needed to set
the world right. But as Germany will never be convinced that the worship of Force is vain,
until she sees herself plunged in defeat and ruin, so the advocates of this so-called historical
method will never make deduction a primary part of their procedure, and will never take the
eternal Christ as their key to Scripture interpretation, until Christ himself shall by a second
spiritual advent enter into their hearts and dissipate their doubts, as he did when he showed
himself to Paul on the way to Damascus.

This is an atom: 
I have tried to point out the inherent error of the method to which I have been objecting,
and to show its ill effects upon systematic theology, upon our theological seminaries, upon
our Baptist churches, and upon our missionary work abroad and at home. I have intimated that
the influence of this perverse treatment of Holy Writ may be seen even in the present internecine
conflict in which the professedly Christian nations are engaged. I shall very naturally be
asked what remedy I propose for so deep-seated and widespread an evil. I can only answer that
I see no permanent cure but the second coming of Christ. But do not misunderstand me. I am
no premillennarian of the ordinary sort. Indeed, I am as much a post-millennialist, as I am
a premillennialist. I believe that both interpretations of prophecy have their rights, and,
believing also as I do that Scripture is a unity and that its seeming contradictions can be
harmonized, I hold that Christ's spiritual coming precedes the millennium, but that his visible
and literal coming follows the millennium. I therefore look for such a spiritual coming into
the hearts of his people, as shall renew their faith, fulfil their joy, and answer to the prediction
of "the rapture of the saints." In other words, I look for a mighty revival of religion, which
will set the churches on their old foundation, and endow them with power to subdue the world.
This war seems to me God's second great demonstration of man's inability to save himself, and
his need of divine power to save him. As the ancient world and its history were God's demonstration
of human sin, and of man's need of Christ's first advent, so this war is God's proof that science
and philosophy, literature and commerce, are not sufficient for man's needs, and that Christ
must again come, if our modern world is ever to be saved. "In the fulness of time" Christ's
first advent occurred. "In the fulness of time" Christ's second advent will occur. But not
until humanity, weary of its load, cries out for its redemption. "How long, O Lord, how long?"
"It is not for us to know the times which the Father has set within his own authority." But
it is ours to believe in Christ's promise, and to pray for its speedy fulfilment. And so, I
beg you to join with me in the one prayer with which our book of Scripture closes, namely,
"Lord Jesus, come quickly!"

THE THEOLOGY OF MISSIONS

This is an atom: 
"The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord." Yes, a candle, but a candle not yet lighted,
a candle which will never be light nor give light, till it is touched by a divine flame. So
said Doctor Parkhurst. Was his interpretation of Scripture correct? He drew from the proverb
the conclusion that man has a religious nature, not in the sense that he is actually religious,
but only in the sense that he has a capacity for religion. Doctor Parkhurst would say that
man is actually religious only when he knows the true God and worships him in spirit and in
truth. To that God he is by nature and by sinful habit blind. He can be light and give light,
only after God has enlightened him by special revelation. His nature is a candle unlighted,
until God touches it with his divine flame.

This is an atom: 
What is the truth in this matter? The months I have spent in these heathen lands have made
deep impression upon me, and the problem of heathenism has loomed up before me as never before.
When one sees thousands prostrating themselves in a Mohammedan mosque and chanting in unison
their ascription of greatness to God, or when one sees a Hindu devotee so absorbed in his prayer
to a senseless idol that he is unconscious of the kicks and shouts of the passers-by, one comes
to realize that man must have a god. The religious instinct is a part of his nature. It is
more than a mere capacity for religion. It is active as well as passive. In some sort the candle
is already burning. It burns at certain times and places with a fierce and demonic glow. When
I saw in Calcutta, so recently the capital of India, a priestess of the temple of Kali, cutting
into bits the flesh and entrails of sheep in order that the poorest worshiper might have for
his farthing some bloody fragment to offer at the shrine of that hideous and lustful and cruel
goddess, I felt sure that, though the candle is burning, it is not always because it has been
touched by a divine flame. There are other powers than God's at work in this universe. Doctor
Parkhurst's explanation of the Scripture text is not sufficient. He acknowledges only a part
of the truth. The candle is giving already a dim and lurid light. Man is blindly worshiping,
groping in the dark, bowing to imaginary deities, the products of his own imagination, the
work of his own hands.

This is an atom: 
We must go even farther than this, and concede that here and there among these crowds of worshipers
there may be one who is a sincere seeker after God and, according to the light that he has,
is trying honestly to serve him. I do not mean a selfish service of ignorant and earthly passion,
but a service prompted by some elementary knowledge of the true God, gained by contemplation
of his works in nature or from the needs of his own soul revealed in conscience. Surely there
was truth and sincerity in the worship of Socrates, of Epictetus, of Marcus Aurelius. The patriarchs
had knowledge of God and walked with God, long before Christ came. And Scripture itself declares
that in every nation he that fears God and works righteousness is accepted by him. David Brainerd
found among the American Indians a man who for years had separated himself from the wickedness
of his people, and had devoted himself to doing them good. Now and then our missionaries find
a heathen whose strivings after God have been prompted by a sense of sin, and whose worship
must have been accepted by the God of love. Though there is "none other name given among men
whereby we may be saved," we cannot doubt that every man who feels himself to be a sinner,
and casts himself upon God's mercy for salvation, does really though unconsciously cast himself
upon Christ, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, and so joins himself to Christ
by the teaching and power of Christ's Spirit, as to be saved in some measure from the dominion
of sin here and from the penalty of sin hereafter.

This is an atom: 
I am a believer in the unity, the sufficiency, and the authority of Scripture--in its unity,
when the parts are put together in their historical connections and with the key to their meaning
furnished us in Christ; in its sufficiency, as a rule of religious faith and practice; and
in its authority, when rightly interpreted with the aid of the Holy Spirit. So I am prepared
to find in the first chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Romans the true philosophy of heathenism,
and the reconciliation of the otherwise seemingly conflicting utterances of Scripture with
regard to the religious nature of man. I learn that God made man upright, and endowed him with
at least a childlike knowledge of himself. But early humanity sought out many inventions, did
not wish to retain God in its knowledge, and substituted for the true God creatures of its
own imagination. In other words, the scriptural explanation of heathenism is found in an original
ancestral sin, in which the human race departed from the true God and gave itself up to the
worship, first, of impersonal nature-powers, and then, of the polytheistic personifications
of these powers which naturally followed.

This is an atom: 
Modern heathenism is the result of an abnormal and downward evolution. Many students of comparative
religion have forgotten that evolution is oftener to lower forms than to higher. Many a species
in the history of life has first become degenerate, and then has become extinct. The shores
of time are strewn with wrecks, and one of these wrecks is human nature. Paul gives us only
the logical and moral interpretation of a biological fact, when he declares that in consequence
of man's departure from God, God gave man over to the dominion of his own passions, in order
that the shame and guilt of his vile affections might awaken his conscience and lead him to
cry for mercy and redemption. Modern heathenism, still surviving in this age of enlightenment,
shows how sin can blind the intellect and harden the heart. When men worship demons of cruelty
and lust instead of God, they reveal the depravity as well as the ignorance of human nature
in its downward evolution. The candle has been lighted indeed, but it has been touched with
the flames of hell.

This is an atom: 
When God made man in his own image, it was only wheat that he sowed in his field. The evil
decision of man has furnished the tares, and their history has been a history of downward evolution.
But side by side with this downward evolution there has been an upward evolution of divine
grace. The tares have been suffered to grow, but only that there might be demonstrated the
power of the wheat to root them out. And from the very beginning Christ has been the author
and principle of the true evolution. He who created the race has been its Preserver, Instructor,
and Saviour. Humanity, in its warring and its lust, would long since have become extinct, if
it had not been for the presence in it of a divine Life and Light. That life and light were
the life and light of the preincarnate Christ. He is "the light that lighteth every man," and
"his life was the light of men." Jonathan Edwards did not go too far, when he recognized in
all natural beauty and goodness the work of Christ. The sunset clouds were painted by the hand
of Christ, and it is he whose glory is celebrated by the cannonading of the autumn storm over
the grave of summer. All the light of conscience is his light; all the progress of science
is his revelation. It was he who led the children of Israel by a pillar of cloud by day and
of fire by night, and who thundered and lightened from Sinai at the giving of the Law. "The
Rock that followed" the chosen people through the wilderness and gave them drink "was Christ."
Every reform within the bounds of heathenism has been due to him. Confucius and Buddha, so
far as they uttered truth, were his messengers. He has never left humanity without a witness
to the power and goodness of God. While men have been seeking an unknown God, he has been that
very God whom they were seeking, and it is he who has incited them to feel after him and find
him. His light has shined in the darkness, and the darkness has comprehended it not, though
in him we live and move and have our being.

This is an atom: 
So there is evolution of good, side by side with the evolution of evil. We may recognize truth
in heathen systems, while we deplore their errors, for Christ himself is the Truth. It is the
single grain of truth in these systems that has given them all their power. They never could
have maintained their hold upon the world, if they had not appealed to some good instincts
of the human heart. A coin made wholly of lead will never pass for a dollar. It must have a
little washing of silver to give it any sort of currency. But it is a counterfeit, for all
its silver washing. So these heathen systems have their grain of truth, but they are false
and soul-destroying all the same. Let us recognize candidly the grains of truth which they
contain, for these are witnesses to the indwelling Christ who has not left humanity wholly
to itself. And let us make these grains of truth our gateways of access to the heathen heart,
while we show the heathen the larger and fuller truth as it is in Jesus.

This is an atom: 
Christ alone can solve the problems of the world and reconcile the warring elements of humanity.
He is our peace, who hath made Jew and Gentile one, having broken down the middle wall of partition,
and having made of the twain one new man, reconciling both to God through the blood of his
Cross. He can make all sects, all parties, all castes, all nations one; because in him are
all the elements of truth which each possesses, without any mixture of their errors. In him
there will be no longer barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, male nor female, for he will bind
all together by virtue of their union with himself. The Hindu, for example, has the truth of
God's immanence, but he turns it into falsehood by denying the correlative and equally important
truth of God's transcendence, making God to be a mere nature-force without personality, while
Scripture recognizes in God both immanence and transcendence, sees God in all things and through
all things, yet above all things. The Hindu has also the truth of God's incarnation, but he
turns it into error, by denying the permanence of that incarnation, the divine incarnation
in Krishna or Buddha being only a temporary assumption of humanity which he leaves behind him
when he reascends to his heaven, while Christ takes our human nature into perpetual union with
himself and makes it sit down with him upon his throne. The Moslem, on the other hand, believes
in God's unity and transcendence, but denies his immanence. His God is far away, not only physically
but also morally, for he is without justice or love. The Moslem holds stoutly to the truth
of God's personality; but he denies the manifestation of that personality in Christ, and also
Christ's personal presence with all believers. Only Christ can break down the middle wall of
partition between Hindu and Moslem, for he alone has the all-inclusive truth that will unite
them both. And so of all divisions of caste, of color, of party, of denomination, and of nationality,
for he alone is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, supremely and absolutely fitted to be the
Bringer of Peace to the world.

This is an atom: 
There is yet another reason why Christ alone can save. Let us remember always that error is
the result of sin, and that before the power of sin can be broken, the penalty of sin must
be removed. In the heart of man is an inextinguishable sense of guilt, and an equally inextinguishable
thirst for reparation. It is the forebodings of conscience that make death terrible. Blind
the eyes and harden the heart, if you will. The accusations of conscience will be like writings
in invisible ink, that come out clear and threatening in times of introspection and of sober
judgment. As Shakespeare says,

This is an atom: 
Their great guilt
    Like poison given to work a great time after,
    Now 'gins to bite the spirits.

This is an atom: 
The greatest chasm is between their souls and God, and they must have peace with God, before
they can have peace with men. Christ is our peace, therefore, first of all, because he makes
atonement for our sins, pays our debts to justice, and sets our conscience free from guilt.
Christ is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the whole world, making peace by the blood
of his Cross. Having made our peace with God, he makes peace in our warring powers of conscience
and will, and then brings about peace in our relations with others. As he made man at the first
of one blood, so he will at last bring all the nations back into one brotherhood of holiness
and love.

This is an atom: 
There is a moral theology, as well as a doctrinal theology. The moral follows the doctrinal,
and shows in practice that the doctrine is truth and not error. Paul includes this moral teaching
in his Epistle to the Romans. At the beginning of his twelfth chapter he passes from his discussion
of justification by faith to speak of the proper effects of faith in the Christian life: "I
beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living
sacrifice." Then comes the noblest summary of duty to be found in all literature. All manner
of social service is enjoined, while the presupposition of that service is ever held to be
the sacrifice of Christ on our behalf and the regenerating grace of God in the Christian heart.
How much the heathen world needs this part of the gospel, only some knowledge of the shameful
vices of the Orient can reveal to us. The first chapter of that same Epistle is a correct picture
of the heathen world of to-day. A pure life, which is also a life lived for others, is something
which surpasses the power of Confucius or Buddha to produce or to maintain. Such lives in the
churches of mission lands are the weightiest arguments for Christianity. But conversion to
Christ goes, in its influence, farther than the individual. It has a far-reaching social influence.
It lifts up the whole family, the whole class, the whole caste, making its members intelligent,
efficient, trustworthy, as many British officials in India gladly bear witness. Christianity
seems likely to give the Sudras precedence of the Brahmans in civil and political affairs,
so that in one case at least the meek shall inherit the earth.

This is an atom: 
The kingdom of God, however, can never win its triumphs solely by external reforms. In order
to obtain the fruits of education, morality, and self-government, you must first have Christian
faith rooted in the soil. Applications of Christianity are necessary, and they are to be earnestly
sought, but it will be vain to seek them, if we have no Christianity to apply. The tendency
in our missions to put the main stress upon physical and social agencies, to the detriment
of simple gospel preaching, is sure to be disappointing in its results. It is like trying to
light a coal-fire by putting your kindlings on top. It is like beginning at the roof, and building
down to the foundation; or like first purifying the stream, and afterwards the fountain. Society
is made up of individuals, and regeneration of the individual must precede all social renovation.
The old gospel, with regard to sin and salvation, is the only gospel that will save the heathen
world; and the living, personal Christ, with his atoning blood and his renewing Spirit, is
the only power that can bring about permanent reformation of social evils and the establishment
of the kingdom of God in the individual, in the nation, and in the world.

This is an atom: 
That this is the true theology of missions, the history of missions is the best of all proofs.
We need not only to touch the intellect, but also to touch the heart. We need to furnish a
motive that will win to action the sluggish and selfish devotees of systems century-old that
have enslaved them. One message, and one only, has accomplished this result, and that is the
message of the Cross. Not the presentation of God's greatness and power, but the story of the
personal Jesus and his giving up of his life for sinners, has moved men to give themselves
to him. The love of Christ has called forth answering love. Greenlanders and Bushmen, Tibetans
and Telugus, Australians and Chinese, have gone to their deaths for Christ, simply because
they had learned that Christ died for them. Of this sort have been the first-fruits of all
our missions. Christ crucified has been the power of God unto salvation. When he who was rich
became poor that we might become rich, he instituted not only an example, but a motive, sufficient
to subdue men's hearts and to conquer the world. "To win for the Lamb that was slain the reward
of his sufferings" has turned illiterate men in India into indomitable propagandists of Christianity;
but it has also made missionaries in Oxford and Edinburgh, in Leicester and Andover--missionaries
like Reginald Heber and John G. Paton, like William Carey and Adoniram Judson. The "offense
of the Cross" is great, but the power of the Cross is greater still, and the theology of missions
must never permit mere philosophy, or education, or physical betterment, or social service,
to take the place of Christ crucified in its preaching.

This is an atom: 
I grieve over the minimizing of Christ's nature and claims that is current in our day, because
I believe that it cuts the sinew of our Christian faith and destroys the chief dynamic in our
missions. I deplore the denial of our Lord's deity and atonement, the refusal to address him
in prayer, the ignoring of his promise to be with his people even to the end of the world.
To meet our needs in the conflict with towering systems of idolatry and superstition, we need
a supernatural Christ; not simply the man of Nazareth, but the Lord of glory; not the Christ
of the Synoptics alone, but also the Christ of John's Gospel; not a merely human example and
leader, but one who "was declared to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from
the dead"; not simply Jesus according to the flesh, but "the Word who was with God and who
was God" in eternity past; not simply God manifest in human life nineteen centuries ago, but
the God who is "the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever"; not simply the humbled, but also
the glorified Saviour, who sits now upon the throne of the universe, all power in heaven and
earth being given into his hand. When we believe in an ascended Lord at God's right hand, the
God of Creation, of Providence, and of Redemption, we have a faith that can conquer the world.
Without such a faith in the omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent Christ, we are weak as
water in the conflict with heathenism. We may set up Christ on a pedestal, in a pantheon like
that of Mrs. Besant, with a statue of Krishna by his side, and the Hindu will laugh at the
claims of the gospel. Only faith in Christ as very God can meet the demands of the hour. "The
spirit of man is the candle of the Lord." In every age Christ has lit that candle, so that
it has given some light. But all who have come before him, pretending to be the Light of the
world, have been thieves and robbers, stealing from Christ his glory and from man his blessing.
Christ alone can so enlighten us that we can be light and can give light. Let us arise and
shine, because our Light has come, and the glory of the Lord has arisen upon us!

MISSIONS AND MISSIONARIES

This is an atom: 
No result of my travel has been more valuable to me than the new impression I have received
of the effect of missions upon missionaries. I came abroad with a lingering idea of my youth
that missionaries were a class by themselves, a solemn set, destitute of humor, and so absorbed
in their work as to be narrow-minded. On the contrary, I have found them joyful and even hilarious,
broad in their views and sympathies, lovers of the good in literature and art. The mental and
spiritual growth of students who left me years ago for a foreign field has greatly surprised
me. Then they were boys; now they are men. The demands of the missionary work have drawn out
their latent powers; they have found their new environment immensely stimulating; contact with
new lands and people has widened their outlook; they have become thinkers and leaders of men.

This is an atom: 
It takes an all-round man to be a good missionary. The learning of a foreign language in which
one has to construct his own grammar and lexicon requires persistent effort of the most disciplined
mind. The missionary is often called upon to build his own house or church. He must be both
architect and supervisor, for his masons know no English, and are bent on slighting their work.
He has servants who steal and coolies who lie. He establishes, manages, and governs a native
school, and generally has to evolve his own pedagogy. He comes into relation with English officials,
American consuls, and native functionaries, and is obliged to know something of social customs.
In fine, he is a jack of all trades, besides being a preacher of the gospel who must adapt
his message to the understanding of the illiterate multitude and of the cultivated man of caste
as well.

This is an atom: 
All this gives the missionary a training beyond that of any university course. Herbert Spencer
asserted that a nation makes progress in civilization in proportion to the variety of its environment.
The principle applies also to the development of the individual. Our missionaries thought perhaps
that they were leaving culture behind them, when they left America for barbarous lands. But
losing their lives for Christ's sake they found to be mental gain. Even on the Congo our men
have learned more, and have developed stronger characters, than would have been possible if
they had accepted ordinary pastorates at home. And they have not lost, but have won, that fine
flavor of sanity and judgment, which belongs to men who have had large experience of life.

This is an atom: 
So far, I have referred only to the intellectual side of one's education. The spiritual equipment
is even more important. In heathendom one comes in contact with towering systems of idolatry
and superstition, venerable with age and rooted deeply in the nature and habit of the people.
The Christian teacher realizes that, in his conflict with these systems, he is powerless, unless
backed by Omnipotence. He is thrown upon the divine resources, and learns, perhaps for the
first time, that, while apart from Christ he can do nothing, with Christ he can do all things.
A new experience of the presence and power of the Saviour comes to him. The struggle that at
first taxed all his energy is at last a glad walk over the course in the strength of Christ.
Anxiety and fear have taught him lessons which he could not otherwise have learned. He has
become a hopeful and joyful Christian.

This is an atom: 
All this tends to render the missionary doctrinally sound. Evangelization makes men evangelical.
When you tell the gospel to a heathen sinner, you must put it in the simplest terms, or he
will fail to understand it. Your effort to reach his mind and heart clarifies your own. To
one condemned and lost, no mere human example in Jesus will suffice; you need an atoning Saviour.
To one struggling with demonic powers and helpless in their grasp, no mere man of Nazareth,
no Jesus, according to the flesh, will answer; you need the Lord of Glory, who was declared
to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead. The doctrine of the Holy
Spirit who regenerates, sanctifies, comforts, and saves, becomes an indispensable element in
preaching, and so becomes ingrained into the preacher's confession of faith. A personal and
present Christ, Immanuel, God with us, is the source of the missionary's power; he has practical
proof that the Holy Spirit is Christ in spiritual form, with his people alway, even to the
end of the world. The reality of God in Christ, manifest in nature, ruling the world in providence,
preparing the nations for judgment, sure to bring the world to his feet, becomes an article
of the missionary's faith, and a constant subject of his teaching. The minimizing of Christ's
nature and claims has no proper place on missionary ground. The missionary indeed is exerting
an influence on the faith of the homeland equal to that which he exerts upon the heathen abroad.

This is an atom: 
It is indeed true that here and there a man who has come out as a missionary has been attracted
and perverted by the very systems he proposed to subdue, and has turned out a teacher of Buddhism
instead of Christianity. But such men had never the root of the matter in them, had never felt
the galling yoke of sin, had never known the joy of Christ's salvation. They had gotten their
preparation for evangelistic work from American teachers of comparative religion, who put Buddha
on the same plane with Christ. The result has only shown the impotence of a man-made gospel
to combat heathenism, or even to save the souls of those who preach that sort of gospel. In
a sense precisely opposite to that of the apostle Paul, they have come to be opposers of the
faith they once proposed to advocate, and destroyers instead of builders of Christian civilization.
All this is a lesson to our missionary societies and churches at home. The colleges and seminaries
which permit indefinite and unevangelical doctrine to be taught, and which retain those who
teach it upon the ground that liberality in theology is a duty, merit the censure of God and
man; for the school or the church that ceases to be evangelical will soon cease to be evangelistic,
and when it ceases to be evangelistic it will soon cease to exist. In this way missions are
the testing-places of Christian doctrine.

This is an atom: 
In a similar way New Testament polity is showing its power in our foreign work. At home we
are getting to be lax in our reception of members, and are taking in numbers of persons without
proper evidence of their conversion. Baptist churches which used to examine carefully their
candidates for admission now receive them without public and oral confession of their faith.
Yet these new members may vote, and may determine the attitude of the church in important exigencies.
All this is avoided in our mission churches. They perceive the necessity of keeping out the
unfit, as clearly as that of admitting the fit. They do not add to their membership by infant
baptism, and they make sure that no pecuniary considerations influence professing converts.
Our Baptist mission churches are fast becoming models of self-supporting, self-governing, and
self-propagating bodies. Missionaries find that their only safety lies in hewing close to the
line of New Testament requirement. Their success in building up Baptist churches in Burma and
among the Telugus, keeps our missionaries faithful to the New Testament model of church polity.
They have the joy of seeing churches organized on scriptural principles, and shedding their
light upon the regions of darkness around them.

This is an atom: 
I wish to say something also about the physical environment of our missionaries and its influence
upon them. I remember that half a century ago I called upon Doctor Thompson of Beirut, the
veteran missionary of the American Board in Syria. I would not have been surprised if I had
found him living in a hut, for my ideas of missionary hardship were very crude. But I was surprised
to find him living in a great stone mansion, with twice as many servants as we ordinarily have
at home. It has taken me some time to learn that in a hot country a cool and spacious house
is a primary necessity of life, if the missionary expects to endure a climate where the thermometer
at times goes up beyond a hundred degrees and stays there. And ordinary comfort cannot be obtained
without servants to do your cooking and running. The large house can be built for half the
cost of such a structure at home, and the servants can be obtained for only a few cents a day
for each one. Remember that in many cases the missionary has not only to be his own physician
and surgeon, but also the physician and surgeon of others; that his house is often a hospital
as well as a gathering-place of inquirers. Remember, too, that the missionary's wife has not
only to perform the household duties of a wife at home, but in addition has probably to be
the supervisor of a girls' school and the only school-teacher and music-teacher that her children
will know until they are old enough to go to the homeland. Remember these considerations, and
you will see that a decent home is essential to a missionary's success in a heathen land. Our
missionary work, like our diplomatic service, has been too long discredited by our insufficient
care for our representatives abroad.

This is an atom: 
Our friends of other denominations are greatly ahead of us in this matter of provision for
their missionaries. Not only are the bungalows built for their residences better than ours,
but their plants of church and school buildings show a larger outlook for the future than ours
show. The English Baptists, the Congregationalists, the Methodists, the Church of England,
yes, even the Theosophists and Buddhists, furnish object-lessons to us in this regard. And
yet, such has been the inventiveness and large-mindedness of our missionaries themselves, that
in all the great centers of our work, they are housed better than the average pastors of our
churches at home. I wish we could double their strength by the establishment of summer rest-houses
in the hills, and by presenting every one of them with a motor-car. But even now, the days
of extreme hardship are past, and no man of ordinary vigor need fear coming to the foreign
field on account of its physical discomforts.

This is an atom: 
When our Lord sent out his first missionaries, he sent them two by two. The real trial of the
missionary is more mental than physical. He greatly needs companionship. Silence in the midst
of the beating of heathen tom-toms becomes enervating and appalling; it may make a man insane.
We are learning the value of team-work in missions. What one man alone could never accomplish,
he can do with the help of others. The American Board in its mission at Madura, India, has
acted upon this principle, and the result is seen in an aggregate of twenty-two thousand church-members.
Our own most successful work has been among the Burmans and Karens, where we have seventy thousand
members, and among the Telugus, where we have as many more. In these fields there are enough
workers to constitute a homogeneous society, with frequent conferences to help the discouraged
and to stimulate the weak. Let us be generous in providing additional helpers and furloughs
to men so far removed from our Christian civilization.

This is an atom: 
But let no one go to the foreign field expecting to get all his strength from his brethren.
Missionary work is no sinecure. It requires not only a sound body and a sound mind, with a
cheerful and hopeful temperament, but also a willingness to endure hardship for Jesus' sake,
and, if need be, with him alone for helper. There are more alleviations of missionary conditions
than were known in its early days, but they still require self-sacrifice. Separation from home
and friends, and, for the pioneer, days of unspeakable loneliness, are the missionary's portion.
The necessity of sending children to America, so that they may escape disease and immorality
among the heathen, is an agony which only the affectionate parent can know. Opportunities for
usefulness which cannot be seized, because of lack of reenforcement from the homeland, involve
a "hope deferred that maketh the heart sick."

This is an atom: 
When Paul went to Athens he probably hoped to win the philosophers to Christ's standard. But
the Stoics and Epicureans scoffed at him. He had to content himself with the multitude of commoner
converts at Corinth. It was doubtless God's sovereignty that determined the result, but God's
sovereignty is also wisdom. It took Paul a long time to learn that God builds his fires from
the bottom, and ordinarily kindles the small sticks first. "Not many wise, not many noble hath
God chosen," but the weak things first, "that no flesh may glory in his presence." Here is
one of the trials of missionary life, and one of the tests of missionary faith. Can the missionary
welcome the conversion of a multitude of low-class people, like the Madigas, when their acceptance
becomes to the proud Brahman an evidence of the ignoble character of Christianity? Yes, he
can, if he has faith in God. He can wait on God, and wait for results.

This is an atom: 
He builded better than he knew,
    The conscious stone to beauty grew.

This is an atom: 
The great Sudra class, a class higher than the Madigas, under the influence of Christianity,
is becoming more intelligent and more influential than the Brahman, and is gradually taking
from him his social prestige and his political power. Many missionaries are expecting a great
turning unto the Lord from among the Sudras. Meantime there is a promise "to him that overcometh."
"If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him." "Our light affliction, which is but
for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." And

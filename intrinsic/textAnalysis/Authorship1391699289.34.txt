CHAPTER I

This is an atom: 
THE ARRIVAL OF THE EUTERPE-THALIA

This is an atom: 
It was about noon of a day in early summer that a westward-bound Atlantic liner was rapidly
nearing the port of New York.  Not long before, the old light-house on Montauk Point had been
sighted, and the company on board the vessel were animated by the knowledge that in a few hours
they would be at the end of their voyage.

This is an atom: 
The vessel now speeding along the southern coast of Long Island was the Euterpe-Thalia, from
Southampton.  On Wednesday morning she had left her English port, and many of her passengers
were naturally anxious to be on shore in time to transact their business on the last day of
the week.  There were even some who expected to make their return voyage on the Melpomene-Thalia,
which would leave New York on the next Monday.

This is an atom: 
The Euterpe-Thalia was one of those combination ocean vessels which had now been in use for
nearly ten years, and although the present voyage was not a particularly rapid one, it had
been made in a little less than three days.

This is an atom: 
As may be easily imagined, a vessel like this was a very different craft from the old steamers
which used to cross the Atlantic--"ocean greyhounds" they were called--in the latter part of
the nineteenth century.

This is an atom: 
It would be out of place here to give a full description of the vessels which at the period
of our story, in 1947, crossed the Atlantic at an average time of three days, but an idea of
their construction will suffice.  Most of these vessels belonged to the class of the Euterpe-Thalia,
and were, in fact, compound marine structures, the two portions being entirely distinct from
each other.  The great hull of each of these vessels contained nothing but its electric engines
and its propelling machinery, with the necessary fuel and adjuncts.

This is an atom: 
The upper portion of the compound vessel consisted of decks and quarters for passengers and
crew and holds for freight.  These were all comprised within a vast upper hull, which rested
upon the lower hull containing the motive power, the only point of contact being an enormous
ball-and-socket joint.  Thus, no matter how much the lower hull might roll and pitch and toss,
the upper hull remained level and comparatively undisturbed.

This is an atom: 
Not only were comfort to passengers and security to movable freight gained by this arrangement
of the compound vessel, but it was now possible to build the lower hull of much less size than
had been the custom in the former days of steamships, when the hull had to be large enough
to contain everything.  As the more modern hull held nothing but the machinery, it was small
in comparison with the superincumbent upper hull, and thus the force of the engine, once needed
to propel a vast mass through the resisting medium of the ocean, was now employed upon a comparatively
small hull, the great body of the vessel meeting with no resistance except that of the air.

This is an atom: 
It was not necessary that the two parts of these compound vessels should always be the same.
The upper hulls belonging to one of the transatlantic lines were generally so constructed that
they could be adjusted to any one of their lower or motive-power hulls.  Each hull had a name
of its own, and so the combination name of the entire vessel was frequently changed.

This is an atom: 
It was not three o'clock when the Euterpe-Thalia passed through the Narrows and moved slowly
towards her pier on the Long Island side of the city.  The quarantine officers, who had accompanied
the vessel on her voyage, had dropped their report in the official tug which had met the vessel
on her entrance into the harbor, and as the old custom-house annoyances had long since been
abolished, most of the passengers were prepared for a speedy landing.

This is an atom: 
One of these passengers--a man about thirty-five--stood looking out over the stern of the vessel
instead of gazing, as were most of his companions, towards the city which they were approaching.
He looked out over the harbor, under the great bridge gently spanning the distance between
the western end of Long Island and the New Jersey shore--its central pier resting where once
lay the old Battery--and so he gazed over the river, and over the houses stretching far to
the west, as if his eyes could catch some signs of the country far beyond.  This was Roland
Clewe, the hero of our story, who had been studying and experimenting for the past year in
the scientific schools and workshops of Germany.  It was towards his own laboratory and his
own workshops, which lay out in the country far beyond the wide line of buildings and settlements
which line the western bank of the Hudson, that his heart went out and his eyes vainly strove
to follow.

This is an atom: 
Skilfully steered, the Thalia moved slowly between high stone piers of massive construction;
but the Euterpe, or upper part of the vessel, did not pass between the piers, but over them
both, and when the pier-heads projected beyond her stern the motion of the lower vessel ceased;
then the great piston, which supported the socket in which the ball of the Euterpe moved, slowly
began to descend into the central portion of the Thalia, and as the tide was low, it was not
long before each side of the upper hull rested firmly and securely upon the stone piers.  Then
the socket on the lower vessel descended rapidly until it was entirely clear of the ball, and
the Thalia backed out from between the piers to take its place in a dock where it would be
fitted for the voyage of the next day but one, when it would move under the Melpomene, resting
on its piers a short distance below, and, adjusting its socket to her ball, would lift her
free from the piers and carry her across the ocean.

This is an atom: 
The pier of the Euterpe was not far from the great Long Island and New Jersey Bridge, and Roland
Clewe, when he reached the broad sidewalk which ran along the river-front, walked rapidly towards
the bridge. When he came to it he stepped into one of the elevators, which were placed at intervals
along its sides from the waterfront to the far-distant point where it touched the land, and
in company with a dozen other pedestrians speedily rose to the top of the bridge, on which
moved two great platforms or floors, one always keeping on its way to the east, and the other
to the west. The floor of the elevator detached itself from the rest of the structure and kept
company with the movable platform until all of its passengers had stepped on to the latter,
when it returned with such persons as wished to descend at that point.

This is an atom: 
As Clewe took his way along the platform, walking westward with it, as if he would thus hasten
his arrival at the other end of the bridge, he noticed that great improvements had been made
during his year of absence.  The structures on the platforms, to which people might retire
in bad weather or when they wished refreshments, were more numerous and apparently better appointed
than when he had seen them last, and the long rows of benches on which passengers might sit
in the open air during their transit had also increased in number.  Many people walked across
the bridge, taking their exercise, while some who were out for the air and the sake of the
view walked in the direction opposite to that in which the platform was moving, thus lengthening
the pleasant trip.

This is an atom: 
At the great elevator over the old Battery many passengers went down and many came up, but
the wide platforms still moved to the east and moved to the west, never stopping or changing
their rate of speed.

This is an atom: 
Roland Clewe remained on the bridge until he had reached its western end, far out on the old
Jersey flats, and there he took a car of the suspended electric line, which would carry him
to his home, some fifty miles in the interior.  The rails of this line ran along the top of
parallel timbers, some twenty feet from the ground, and below and between these rails the cars
were suspended, the wheels which rested on the rails being attached near the top of the car.
Thus it was impossible for the cars to run off the track; and as their bottoms or floors were
ten or twelve feet from the ground, they could meet with no dangerous obstacles.  In consequence
of the safety of this structure, the trains were run at a very high speed.

This is an atom: 
Roland Clewe was a man who had given his life, even before he ceased to be a boy, to the investigation
of physical science and its applications, and those who thought they knew him called him a
great inventor; but he, who knew himself better than any one else could know him, was aware
that, so far, he had not invented anything worthy the power which he felt within himself.

This is an atom: 
After the tidal wave of improvements and discoveries which had burst upon the world at the
end of the nineteenth century there had been a gradual subsidence of the waters of human progress,
and year by year they sank lower and lower, until, when the twentieth century was yet young,
it was a common thing to say that the human race seemed to have gone backward fifty or even
a hundred years.

This is an atom: 
It had become fashionable to be unprogressive.  Like old furniture in the century which had
gone out, old manners, customs, and ideas had now become more attractive than those which were
modern and present.  Philosophers said that society was retrograding, that it was becoming
satisfied with less than was its due; but society answered that it was falling back upon the
things of its ancestors, which were sounder and firmer, more simple and beautiful, more worthy
of the true man and woman, than all that mass of harassing improvement which had swept down
upon mankind in the troubled and nervous days at the end of the nineteenth century.

This is an atom: 
On the great highways, smooth and beautiful, the stage-coach had taken the place to a great
degree of the railroad train; the steamship, which moved most evenly and with less of the jarring
and shaking consequent upon high speed, was the favored vessel with ocean travellers.  It was
not considered good form to read the daily papers; and only those hurried to their business
who were obliged to do so in order that their employers might attend to their affairs in the
leisurely manner which was then the custom of the business world.

This is an atom: 
Fast horses had become almost unknown, and with those who still used these animals a steady
walker was the favorite.  Bicycles had gone out as the new century came in, it being a matter
of course that they should be superseded by the new electric vehicles of every sort and fashion,
on which one could work the pedals if he desired exercise, or sit quietly if his inclinations
were otherwise, and only the very young or the intemperate allowed themselves rapid motion
on their electric wheels.  It would have been considered as vulgar at that time to speed over
a smooth road as it would have been thought in the nineteenth century to run along the city
sidewalk.

This is an atom: 
People thought the world moved slower; at all events, they hoped it would soon do so.  Even
the wiser revolutionists postponed their outbreaks.  Success, they believed, was fain to smile
upon effort which had been well postponed.

This is an atom: 
Men came to look upon a telegram as an insult; the telephone was preferred, because it allowed
one to speak slowly if he chose. Snap-shot cameras were found only in the garrets.  The fifteen
minutes' sittings now in vogue threw upon the plate the color of the eyes, hair, and the flesh
tones of the sitter.  Ladies wore hoop skirts.

This is an atom: 
But these days of passivism at last passed by; earnest thinkers had not believed in them; they
knew they were simply reactionary, and could not last; and the century was not twenty years
old when the world found itself in a storm of active effort never known in its history before.
Religion, politics, literature, and art were called upon to get up and shake themselves free
of the drowsiness of their years of inaction.

This is an atom: 
On that great and crowded stage where the thinkers of the world were busy in creating new parts
for themselves without much reference to what other people were doing in their parts, Roland
Clewe was now ready to start again, with more earnestness and enthusiasm than before, to essay
a character which, if acted as he wished to act it, would give him exceptional honor and fame,
and to the world, perhaps, exceptional advantage.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER II

This is an atom: 
THE SARDIS WORKS

This is an atom: 
At the little station of Sardis, in the hill country of New Jersey, Roland Clewe alighted from
the train, and almost instantly his hand was grasped by an elderly man, plainly and even roughly
dressed, who appeared wonderfully glad to see him. Clewe also was greatly pleased at the meeting.

This is an atom: 
"Tell me, Samuel, how goes everything?" said Clewe, as they walked off.  "Have you anything
to say that you did not telegraph?  How is your wife?"

This is an atom: 
"She's all right," was the answer.  "And there's nothin' happened, except, night before last,
a man tried to look into your lens-house."

This is an atom: 
"How did he do that?" exclaimed Clewe, suddenly turning upon his companion.  "I am amazed!
Did he use a ladder?"

This is an atom: 
Old Samuel grinned.  "He couldn't do that, you know, for the flexible fence would keep him
off.  No; he sailed over the place in one of those air-screw machines, with a fan workin' under
the car to keep it up."

This is an atom: 
"And so he soared up above my glass roof and looked down, I suppose?"

This is an atom: 
"That's what he did," said Samuel; "but he had a good deal of trouble doin' it.  It was moonlight,
and I watched him."

This is an atom: 
"Why didn't you fire at him?" asked Clewe.  "Or at least let fly one of the ammonia squirts
and bring him down?"

This is an atom: 
"I wanted to see what he would do," said the old man.  "The machine he had couldn't be steered,
of course.  He could go up well enough, but the wind took him where it wanted to.  But I must
give this feller the credit of sayin' that he managed his basket pretty well.  He carried it
a good way to the windward of the lens-house, and then sent it up, expectin' the wind to take
it directly over the glass roof, but it shifted a little, and so he missed the roof and had
to try it again.  He made two or three bad jobs of it, but finally managed it by hitchin' a
long cord to a tree, and then the wind held him there steady enough to let him look down for
a good while."

This is an atom: 
"You don't tell me that!" cried Clewe.  "Did you stay there and let him look down into my lens-house?"

This is an atom: 
The old man laughed.  "I let him look down," said he, "but he didn't see nothin'.  I was laughin'
at him all the time he was at work.  He had his instruments with him, and he was turnin' down
his different kinds of lights, thinkin', of course, that he could see through any kind of coverin'
that we put over our machines; but, bless you! he couldn't do nothin', and I could almost hear
him swear as he rubbed his eyes after he had been lookin' down for a little while."

This is an atom: 
Clewe laughed.  "I see," said he.  "I suppose you turned on the photo-hose."

This is an atom: 
"That's just what I did," said the old man.  "Every night while you were away I had the lens-room
filled with the revolving-light squirts, and when these were turned on I knew there was no
gettin' any kind of rays through them.  A feller may look through a roof and a wall, but he
can't look through light comin' the other way, especially when it's twistin' and curlin' and
spittin'."

This is an atom: 
"That's a capital idea," said Clewe.  "I never thought of using the photo-hose in that way.
But there are very few people in this world who would know anything about my new lens machinery
even if they saw it.  This fellow must have been that Pole, Rovinski.  I met him in Europe,
and I think he came over here not long before I did."

This is an atom: 
"That's the man, sir," said Samuel.  "I turned a needle searchlight on him just as he was givin'
up the business, and I have got a little photograph of him at the house.  His face is mostly
beard, but you'll know him."

This is an atom: 
"What became of him?" asked Clewe.

This is an atom: 
"My light frightened him," he said, "and the wind took him over into the woods.  I thought,
as you were comin' home so soon, I wouldn't do nothin' more.  You had better attend to him
yourself."

This is an atom: 
"Very good," said Clewe.  "I'll do that."

This is an atom: 
The home of Roland Clewe, a small house plainly furnished, but good enough for a bachelor's
quarters, stood not half a mile from the station, and near it were the extensive buildings
which he called his Works.  Here were laboratories, large machine-shops in which many men were
busy at all sorts of strange contrivances in metal and other materials; and besides other small
edifices there was a great round tower-like structure, with smooth iron walls thirty feet high
and without windows, and which was lighted and ventilated from the top.  This was Clewe's special
workshop; and besides old Samuel Block and such workmen as were absolutely necessary and could
be trusted, few people ever entered it but himself.  The industries in the various buildings
were diverse, some of them having no apparent relation to the others.  Each of them was expected
to turn out something which would revolutionize something or other in this world, but it was
to his lens-house that Roland Clewe gave, in these days, his special attention. Here a great
enterprise was soon to begin, more important in his eyes than anything else which had engaged
human endeavor.

This is an atom: 
When sometimes in his moments of reflection he felt obliged to consider the wonders of applied
electricity, and give them their due place in comparison with the great problem he expected
to solve, he had his moments of doubt.  But these moments did not come frequently.  The day
would arrive when from his lens-house there would be promulgated a great discovery which would
astonish the world.

This is an atom: 
During Roland Clewe's absence in Germany his works had been left under the general charge of
Samuel Block.  This old man was not a scientific person; he was not a skilled mechanic; in
fact, he had been in early life a shoemaker.  But when Roland Clewe, some five years before,
had put up his works near the little village of Sardis, he had sent for Block, whom he had
known all his life and who was at that time the tenant of a small farm, built a cottage for
him and his wife, and told him to take care of the place. From planning the grounds and superintending
fences, old Sammy had begun to keep an eye upon builders and mechanics; and, being a very shrewd
man, he had gradually widened the sphere of his caretaking, until, at this time, he exercised
a nominal supervision over all the buildings.  He knew what was going on in each; he had a
good idea, sometimes, of the scientific basis of this or that bit of machinery, and had gradually
become acquainted with the workings and management of many of the instruments; and now and
then he gave to his employer very good hints in regard to the means of attaining an end, more
especially in the line of doing something by instrumentalities not intended for that purpose.
If Sammy could take any machine which had been constructed to bore holes, and with it plug
up orifices, he would consider that he had been of advantage to his kind.

This is an atom: 
Block was a thoroughly loyal man.  The interests of his employer were always held by him first
and above everything.  But although the old man understood, sometimes very well, and always
in a fair degree, what the inventor was trying to accomplish, and appreciated the magnitude
and often the amazing nature of his operations, he never believed in any of them.

This is an atom: 
Sammy was a thoroughly old-fashioned man.  He had been born and had grown up in the days when
a steam-locomotive was good enough and fast enough for any sensible traveller, and he greatly
preferred a good pair of horses to any vehicle which one steered with a handle and regulated
the speed thereof with a knob. Roland Clew e might devise all the wonderful contrivances he
pleased, and he might do all sorts of astonishing things with them, but Sammy would still be
of the opinion that, even if the machines did all that they were expected to do, the things
they did generally would not be worth the doing.

This is an atom: 
Still, the old man would not interfere by word or deed with any of the plans or actions of
his employer.  On the contrary, he would help him in every possible way--by fidelity, by suggestion,
by constant devotion and industry; but, in spite of all that, it was one of the most firmly
founded principles of his life that Roland Clewe had no right to ask him to believe in the
value of the wild and amazing schemes he had on hand.

This is an atom: 
Before Roland Clewe slept that night he had visited all his workshops, factories, and laboratories.
His men had been busily occupied during his absence under the directions of their various special
managers, and those in charge were of the opinion that everything had progressed as favorably
and as rapidly as should have been expected; but Roland Clewe was not satisfied, even though
many of his inventions and machines were much nearer completion than he had expected to find
them.  The work necessary to be done in his lens-house before he could go on with the great
work of his life was not yet finished.

This is an atom: 
As well as he could judge, it would be a month or two before he could devote himself to those
labors in his lens-house the thought of which had so long filled his mind by day, and even
during his sleep.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER III

This is an atom: 
MARGARET RALEIGH

This is an atom: 
After breakfast the-following morning Roland Clewe mounted his horse and rode over to a handsome
house which stood upon a hill about a mile and a half from Sardis.  Horses, which had almost
gone out of use during the first third of the century, were now getting to be somewhat in fashion
again.  Many people now appreciated the pleasure which these animals had given to the world
since the beginning of history, and whose place, in an aesthetic sense, no inanimate machine
could supply.  As Roland Clewe swung himself from the saddle at the foot of a broad flight
of steps, the house door was opened and a lady appeared.

This is an atom: 
"I saw you coming!" she exclaimed, running down the steps to meet him.

This is an atom: 
She was a handsome woman, inclined to be tall, and some five years younger than Clewe.  This
was Mrs. Margaret Raleigh, partner with Roland Clewe in the works at Sardis, and, in fact,
the principal owner of that great estate.  She was a widow, and her husband had been not only
a man of science, but a very rich man; and when he died, at the outset of his career, his widow
believed it her duty to devote his fortune to the prosecution and development of scientific
works.  She knew Roland Clewe as a hard student and worker, as a man of brilliant and original
ideas, and as the originator of schemes which, if carried out successfully, would place him
among the great inventors of the world.

This is an atom: 
She was not a scientific woman in the strict sense of the word, but she had a most thorough
and appreciative sympathy with all forms of physical research, and there was a distinctiveness
and grandeur in the aims towards which Roland Clewe had directed his life work which determined
her to unite, with all the power of her money and her personal encouragement, in the labors
he had set for himself.

This is an atom: 
Therefore it was that the main part of the fortune left by Herbert Raleigh had been invested
in the shops and foundries at Sardis, and that Roland Clewe and Margaret Raleigh were partners
and co-owners in the business and the plant of the establishment.

This is an atom: 
"I am glad to welcome you back," said she, her hand in his.  "But it strikes me as odd to see
you come upon a horse; I should have supposed that by this time you would arrive sliding over
the tree-tops on a pair of aerial skates."

This is an atom: 
"No," said he.  "I may invent that sort of thing, but I prefer to use a horse.  Don't you remember
my mare?  I rode her before I went away.  I left her in old Sammy's charge, and he has been
riding her every day."

This is an atom: 
"And glad enough to do it, I am sure," said she, "for I have heard him say that the things
he hates most in this world are dead legs.  'When I can't use mine,' he said, 'let me have
some others that are alive.'  This is such a pretty creature," she added, as Clewe was looking
about for some place to which he might tie his animal, "that I have a great mind to learn to
ride myself!"

This is an atom: 
"A woman on a horse would be a queer sight," said he; and with this they went into the house.

This is an atom: 
The conference that morning in Mrs. Raleigh's library was a long and somewhat anxious one.
For several years the money of the Raleigh estate had been freely and generously expended upon
the enterprises in hand at the Sardis Works, but so far nothing of important profit had resulted
from the operations.  Many things had been carried on satisfactorily and successfully to various
stages, but nothing had been finished; and now the two partners had to admit that the work
which Clewe had expected to begin immediately upon his return from Europe must be postponed.

This is an atom: 
Still, there was no sign of discouragement in the voices or the faces--it may be said, in the
souls--of the man and woman who sat there talking across a table.  He was as full of hope as
ever he was, and she as full of faith.

This is an atom: 
They were an interesting couple to look upon.  He, dark, a little hollow in the cheeks, a slight
line or two of anxiety in the forehead, a handsome, well-cut mouth, without beard, and a frame
somewhat spare but strong; a man of graceful but unaffected action, dressed in a riding-coat,
breeches, and leather leggings. She, her cheeks colored with earnest purpose, her gray eyes
rather larger than usual as she looked up from the paper where she had been calculating, was
dressed in the simple artistic fashion of the day.  The falling folds of the semi-clinging
fabrics accommodated themselves well to a figure which even at that moment of rest suggested
latent energy and activity.

This is an atom: 
"If we have to wait for the Artesian ray," she said, "we must try to carry out something else.
People are watching us, talking of us, expecting something of us; we must give them something.
Now the question is, what shall that be?"

This is an atom: 
"The way I look at it is this," said her companion.  "For a long time you have been watching
and waiting and expecting something, and it is time that I should give you something; now the
question is--"

This is an atom: 
"Not at all," said she, interrupting.  "You arrogate too much to yourself.  I don't expect
you to give anything to me.  We are working together, and it is both of us who must give this
poor old world something to satisfy it for a while, until we can disclose to it that grand
discovery, grander than anything that it has ever even imagined.  I want to go on talking about
it, but I shall not do it; we must keep our minds tied down to some present purpose.  Now,
Mr. Clewe, what is there that we can take up and carry on immediately?  Can it be the great shell?"

This is an atom: 
Clewe shook his head.

This is an atom: 
"No," said he; "that is progressing admirably, but many things are necessary before we can
experiment with it."

This is an atom: 
"Since you were away," said she, "I have often been down to the works to look at it, but everything
about it seems to go so slowly.  However, I suppose it will go fast enough when it is finished."

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said he.  "I hope it will go fast enough to overturn the artillery of the world; but,
as you say, don't let us talk about the things for which we must wait.  I will carefully consider
everything that is in operation, and to-morrow I will suggest something with which we can go on."

This is an atom: 
"After all," said she, as they stood together before parting, "I cannot take my mind from the
Artesian ray."

This is an atom: 
"Nor can I," he answered; "but for the present we must put our hands to work at something else."

This is an atom: 
The Artesian ray, of which these two spoke, was an invention upon which Roland Clewe had been
experimenting for a long time, and which was and had been the object of his labors and studies
while in Europe.  In the first decade of the century it had been generally supposed that the
X ray, or cathode ray, had been developed and applied to the utmost extent of its capability.
It was used in surgery and in mechanical arts, and in many varieties of scientific operations,
but no considerable advance in its line of application had been recognized for a quarter of
a century. But Roland Clewe had come to believe in the existence of a photic force, somewhat
similar to the cathode ray, but of infinitely greater significance and importance to the searcher
after physical truth.  Simply described, his discovery was a powerful ray produced by a new
combination of electric lights, which would penetrate down into the earth, passing through
all substances which it met in its way, and illuminating and disclosing everything through
which it passed.

This is an atom: 
All matter likely to be found beneath the surface of the earth in that part of the country
had been experimented upon by Clewe, and nothing had resisted the penetrating and illuminating
influence of his ray--well called Artesian ray, for it was intended to bore into the bowels
of the earth.  After making many minor trials of the force and powers of his light, Roland
Clewe had undertaken the construction of a massive apparatus, by which he believed a ray could
be generated which, little by little, perhaps foot by foot, would penetrate into the earth
and light up everything between the farthest point it had attained and the lenses of his machine.
That is to say, he hoped to produce a long hole of light about three feet in diameter and as
deep as it was possible to make it descend, in which he could see all the various strata and
deposits of which the earth is composed.  How far he could send down this piercing cylinder
of light he did not allow himself to consider.  With a small and imperfect machine he had seen
several feet into the ground; with a great and powerful apparatus, such as he was now constructing,
why should he not look down below the deepest point to which man's knowledge had ever reached?
Down so far that he must follow his descending light with a telescope; down, down until he
had discovered the hidden secrets of the earth!

This is an atom: 
The peculiar quality of this light, which gave it its great preeminence over all other penetrating
rays, was the power it possessed of illuminating an object; passing through it; rendering it
transparent and invisible; illuminating the opaque substance it next met in its path, and afterwards
rendering that transparent. If the rocks and earth in the cylindrical cavities of light which
Clewe had already produced in his experiments had actually been removed with pickaxes and shovels,
the lighted hole a few feet in depth could not have appeared more real, the bottom and sides
of the little well could not have been revealed more sharply and distinctly; and yet there
was no hole in the ground, and if one should try to put his foot into the lighted perforation
he would find it as solid as any other part of the earth.

CHAPTER IV

This is an atom: 
THE MISSION OF SAMUEL BLOCK

This is an atom: 
Not far from the works at Sardis there was a large pond, which was formed by the damming of
a stream which at this point ran between high hills.  In order to obtain a sufficient depth
of water for his marine experiments, Roland Clewe had built an unusually high and strong dam,
and this body of water, which was called the lake, widened out considerably behind the dam
and stretched back for more than half a mile.

This is an atom: 
He was standing on the shore of this lake, early the next morning, in company with several
workmen, examining a curious-looking vessel which was moored near by, when Margaret Raleigh
came walking towards him.  When he saw her he left the men and went to meet her.

This is an atom: 
"You could not wait until I came to your house to tell you what I was going to do?" he said,
smiling.

This is an atom: 
"No," she answered, "I could not.  The Artesian ray kept me awake nearly all night, and I felt
that I must quiet my mind as soon as I could by giving it something real and tangible to take
hold of. Now what is it that you are going to do?  Anything in the ship line?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said he, "it is something in that line.  But let us walk back a little; I am not quite
ready to tell the men everything. I have been thinking," he said, as they moved together from
the lake, "of that practical enterprise which we must take up and finish, in order to justify
ourselves to the public and those who have in various ways backed up our enterprises, and I
have concluded that the best thing I can do is to carry out my plan of going to the north pole."

This is an atom: 
"What!" she exclaimed.  "You are not going to try to do that --you, yourself?"  And as she
spoke, her voice trembled a little.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said he, "I thought I would go myself, or else send Sammy."

This is an atom: 
She laughed.

This is an atom: 
"Ridiculous!" said she.  "Send Sammy Block!  You are joking?"

This is an atom: 
"No," said he, "I am not.  I have been planning the expedition, and I think Sammy would be
an excellent man to take charge of it. I might go part of the way--at least, far enough to
start him--and I could so arrange matters that Sammy would have no difficulty in finishing
the expedition, but I do not think that I could give up all the time that such an enterprise
deserves.  It is not enough to merely find the pole; one should stay there and make observations
which would be of service."

This is an atom: 
"But if Sammy finishes the journey himself," she said, "his will be the glory."

This is an atom: 
"Let him have it," replied Clewe.  "If my method of arctic exploration solves the great problem
of the pole, I shall be satisfied with the glory I get from the conception.  The mere journey
to the northern end of the earth's axis is of slight importance.  I shall be glad to have Sammy
go first, and have as many follow him as may choose to travel in that direction."

This is an atom: 
"Yet it is a great achievement," said she.  "I would give much to be the first human being
who has placed his foot upon the north pole."

This is an atom: 
"You would get it wet, I am afraid," said Clewe, smiling; "but that is not the kind of glory
I crave.  If I can help a man to go there, I shall be very willing to do so, provided he will
make me a favorable report of his discoveries."

This is an atom: 
"Tell me all about it," she said--"when will you start?  How many will go?"

This is an atom: 
"There is some work to be done on that boat," said he.  "Let me set the men at it, and then
we will go into the office, and I will lay everything before you."

This is an atom: 
When they were seated in a quiet little room attached to one of the large buildings, Roland
Clewe made ready to describe his proposed arctic expedition to his partner, in whose mind the
wonderful enterprise had entered, driving out the disturbing thoughts of the Artesian ray.

This is an atom: 
"You have told me about it before," said she, "but I am not quite sure that I have it all straight
in my mind.  You will go, I suppose, in a submarine boat--that is, whoever goes will go in it?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said he, "for part of the way.  My plan is to proceed in an ordinary vessel as far north
as Cape Tariff, taking the Dipsey, my submarine boat, in tow.  The exploring party, with the
necessary stores and instruments, will embark on the Dipsey, but before they start they will
make a telegraphic connection with the station at Cape Tariff.  The Dipsey will carry one of
those light, portable cables, which will be wound on a drum in her hold, and this will be paid
out as she proceeds on her way. Thus, you see, by means of the cable from Cape Tariff to St.
Johns, we can be in continual communication with Sammy, no matter where he may go; for there
is no reason to suppose that the ocean in those northern regions is too deep to allow the successful
placing of a telegraphic cable.

This is an atom: 
"My plan is a very simple one, but as we have not talked it over for some time, I will describe
it in full.  All explorers who have tried to get to the north pole have met with the same bad
fortune.  They could not pass over the vast and awful regions of ice which lay between them
and the distant point at which they aimed; the deadly ice-land was always too much for them;
they died or they turned back.

This is an atom: 
"When flying-machines were brought to supposed perfection, some twenty years ago, it was believed
that the pole would easily be reached, but there were always the wild and wicked winds, in
which no steering apparatus could be relied upon.  We may steer and manage our vessels in the
fiercest storms at sea, but when the ocean moves in one great tidal wave our rudders are of
no avail.  Everything rushes on together, and our strongest ships are cast high upon the land.

This is an atom: 
"So it happened to the Canadian Bagne, who went in 1927 in the best flying-ship ever made,
and which it was supposed could be steadily kept upon its way without regard to the influence
of the strongest winds; but a great hurricane came down from the north, as if square miles
of atmosphere were driving onward in a steady mass, and hurled him and his ship against an
iceberg, and nothing of his vessel but pieces of wood and iron, which the bears could not eat,
was ever seen again.  This was the last polar expedition of that sort, or any sort; but my
plan is so easy of accomplishment--at least, so it seems to me--and so devoid of risk and danger,
that it amazes me that it has never been tried before. In fact, if I had not thought that it
would be such a comparatively easy thing to go to the pole, I believe I should have been there
long ago; but I have always considered that it could be done at some season when more difficult
and engrossing projects were not pressing upon me.

This is an atom: 
"What I propose to do is to sink down below the bottom of the ice in the arctic regions, and
then to proceed in a direct line northward to the pole.  The distance between the lower portions
of the ice and the bottom of the Arctic Ocean I believe to be quite sufficient to allow me
all the room needed for navigation. I do not think it necessary to even consider the contingency
of the greatest iceberg or floe reaching the bottom of the arctic waters; consequently, without
trouble or danger, the Dipsey can make a straight course for the extreme north.

This is an atom: 
"By means of the instruments the Dipsey will carry it will be comparatively easy to determine
the position of the pole, and before this point is reached I believe she will find herself
in an open sea, where she may rise to the surface.  But if this should not be the case, a comparatively
thin place in the ice will be chosen, and a great opening blown through it by means of an ascensional
shell, several of which she will carry.  She will then rise to the surface of the water in
this opening, and the necessary operations will be carried on."

This is an atom: 
"Mr. Clewe," said Margaret Raleigh, "the thing is so terrible I cannot bear to think of it.
The Dipsey may have to sail hundreds and hundreds of miles under the ice, shut in as if an
awful lid were put over her.  No matter what happened down there, she could not come up and
get out; it would be the same thing as having a vast sky of ice stretched out above one.  I
should think the very idea of it would make people shudder and die."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, it is not so bad as all that," answered Clewe.  "There is nothing so dear to the marine
explorer as plenty of water, and plenty of room to sail in, and under the ice the Dipsey will
find all that."

This is an atom: 
"But there are so many dangers," said she, "that you cannot provide against in advance."

This is an atom: 
"That is very true," said he, "but I have thought so much about them, and I have studied and
consulted so much about them, that I think I have provided against all the dangers we have
reason to expect.  To me the whole business seems like very plain, straightforward sailing."

This is an atom: 
"It may seem so here," said Margaret Raleigh, "but it will be quite another thing out under
the arctic ice."

This is an atom: 
Preparations for the expedition were pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and Clewe would
have been delighted to make this voyage into the unseen regions of the nether ice, but he knew
that it was his duty not to lose time or to risk his life when he was on the brink of a discovery
far more wonderful, far more important to the world, than the finding of the pole.  Therefore
he determined that he would go with the expedition no farther than the point where the ice
would prevent the farther progress of the vessel in which they would sail from New York.

This is an atom: 
It was not to be supposed that Roland Clewe intended to intrust such an expedition to the absolute
command of such a man as old Samuel Block.  There would be on board the Dipsey an electrician
who had long been preparing himself for this expedition; there were to be other scientific
men; there would be a submarine engineer, and such minor officers and assistants as would be
necessary; but Clewe wanted some one who would represent him, who could be trusted to act in
his place in case of success or of failure, who could be thoroughly depended upon should a
serious emergency arise.  Such a man was Samuel Block, and, somewhat strange to say, old Sammy
was perfectly willing to go to the pole.  He was always ready for anything within bounds of
his duty, and those bounds included everything which Mr. Clewe wished done.

This is an atom: 
Sammy was an old-fashioned man, and therefore, in talking over arrangements with Roland Clewe,
he insisted upon having a sailor in the party.

This is an atom: 
"In old times," said he, "when I was a young man, nobody ever thought of settin' out on any
kind of sea-voyagin' without havin' a sailor along.  The fact is, they used to be pretty much
all sailors."

This is an atom: 
"But in this expedition," said Clewe, "a sailor would be out of place.  One of your old-fashioned
mariners would not know what to do under the water.  Submarine voyaging is an entirely different
profession from that of the old-time navigator."

This is an atom: 
"I know all that," said Sammy.  "I know how everything is a machine nowadays; but I shall never
forget what a glorious thing it was to sail on the sea with the wind blowin' and the water
curlin' beneath your keel.  I lived on the coast, and used to go out whenever I had a chance,
but things is mightily changed nowadays.  Just think of that yacht-race in England the other
day--a race between two electric yachts, with a couple of vessels ploughin' along to windward
carryin' between 'em a board fence thirty feet high to keep the wind off the yachts and give
'em both smooth water and equal chance.  I can't get used to that sort of thing, and I tell
you, sir, that if I am goin' on a voyage to the pole, I want to have a sailor along.  If everything
goes all right, we must come to the top of the water some time, and then we ought to have at
least one man who understands surface navigation."

This is an atom: 
"All right," said Clewe; "get your sailor."

This is an atom: 
"I've got my eye on him; he's a Cape Cod man, and he's not so very old either.  When he was
a boy people went about in ships with sails, and even after he grew up Cap'n Jim was a great
feller to manage a catboat; for things has moved slower on the Cape than in many parts of the
country."

This is an atom: 
So Captain Jim Hubbell was engaged as sailor to the expedition; and when he came on to Sardis
and looked over the Dipsey he expressed a general opinion of her construction and capabilities
which indicated a disposition on his part to send her, and all others fashioned after her plan,
to depths a great deal lower than ever had been contemplated by their inventors.  Still, as
he wanted very much to go to the pole if it was possible that he could get there, and as the
wages offered him were exceedingly liberal, Captain Jim enlisted, in the party.  His duties
were to begin when the Dipsey floated on the surface of the sea like a commonsense craft.

This is an atom: 
A day or two before the expedition was ready to start, Roland Clewe was very much surprised
one morning by a visit from Sammy's wife, Mrs. Sarah Block, who lost no time in informing him
that she had made up her mind to accompany her husband on the perilous voyage he was about to make.

This is an atom: 
"You!" said Clewe.  "You could not go on such an expedition as that!"

This is an atom: 
"If Sammy goes, I go," said Mrs. Block.  "If it is dangerous for me, it is dangerous for him.
I have been tryin' to get sense enough in his head to make him stay at home, but I can't do
it; so I have made up my mind that I go with him or he don't go.  We have travelled together
on top of the land, and we have travelled together on top of the water, and if there's to be
travellin' under the water, why then we travel together all the same.  If Sammy goes polin',
I go polin'.  I think he's a fool to do it; but if he's goin' to be a fool, I am goin' to be
a fool.  And as for my bein' in the way, you needn't think of that, Mr. Clewe.  I can cook
for the livin', I can take care of the sick, and I can sew up the dead in shrouds."

This is an atom: 
"All right, Mrs. Block," said Clewe.  "If you insist on it, and Sammy is willing, you may go;
but I will beg of you not to say anything about the third class of good offices which you propose
to perform for the party, for it might cast a gloom over some of the weaker-minded."

This is an atom: 
"Cast a gloom!" said Mrs. Block.  "If all I hear is true, there will be a general gloom over
everything that will be like havin' a black pocket-handkercher tied over your head, and I don't
know that anything I could say would make that gloom more gloomier."

This is an atom: 
When Margaret Raleigh parted with Clewe on the deck of the Go Lightly, the large electric vessel
which was to tow the Dipsey up to the limits of navigable Northern waters, she knew he must
make a long journey, nearly twice as far as the voyage to England, before she could hear from
him; but when he arrived at Cape Tariff, a point far up on the northwestern coast of Greenland,
she would hear from him; for from this point there was telegraphic communication with the rest
of the world. There was a little station there, established by some commercial companies, and
their agent was a telegraph-operator.

This is an atom: 
The passage from New York to Cape Tariff was an uneventful one, and when Clewe disembarked
at the lonely Greenland station he was greeted by a long message from Mrs. Raleigh, the principal
import of which was that on no account must he allow himself to be persuaded to go on the submarine
voyage of the Dipsey.  On his part, Clewe had no desire to make any change in his plans. During
all the long voyage northward his heart had been at Sardis.

This is an atom: 
The Dipsey was a comparatively small vessel, but it afforded comfortable accommodations for
a dozen or more people, and there was room for all the stores which would be needed for a year.
She was furnished, besides, with books and every useful and convenient contrivance which had
been thought desirable for her peculiar expedition.

This is an atom: 
When everything was ready, Roland Clewe took leave of the officers, the crew, and the passenger
on board the Dipsey, and the last-mentioned, as she shook hands with him, shed tears.

This is an atom: 
"It seems to me like a sort of a congregational suicide, Mr. Clewe," said she.  "And it can't
even be said that all the members are doin' it of their own accord, for I am not.  If Sammy
did not go, I would not, but if he does, I do, and there's the end of that; and I suppose it
won't be very much longer before there's the end of all of us.  I hope you will tell Mrs. Raleigh
that I sent my best love to her with my last words; for even if I was to see her again, it
would seem to me like beginning all over again, and this would be the end of this part of my
life all the same.  What I hope and pray for is that none of the party may die of any kind
of a disease before the rest all go to their end together; for remains on board an under-water
vessel is somethin' which mighty few nerves would be able to stand."

This is an atom: 
When all farewells had been said, Mr. Clewe went on board the Go Lightly, on the deck of which
were her officers and men and the few inhabitants of the station, and then the plate-glass
hatchways of the Dipsey were tightly closed, and she began to sink, until she entirely disappeared
below the surface of the water, leaving above her a little floating glass globe, connected
with her by an electric wire.

This is an atom: 
As the Dipsey went under the sea, this little globe followed her on the surface, and the Go
Lightly immediately began to move after her.  This arrangement had been made, as Clewe wished
to follow the Dipsey for a time, in order to see if everything was working properly with her.
She kept on a straight course, flashing a light into the little globe every now and then; and
finally, after meeting some floating ice, she shattered the globe with an explosion, which
was the signal agreed upon to show that all was well, and that the Dipsey had started off alone
on the submarine voyage to the pole.

This is an atom: 
Roland Clewe gazed out over the wide stretch of dark-green waves and glistening crests, where
nothing could be seen which indicated life except a distant, wearily-flapping sea bird, and
then, turning his back upon the pole, he made preparations for his return voyage to New York,
at which port he might expect to receive direct news from Sammy Block and his companions.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER V

This is an atom: 
UNDER WATER

This is an atom: 
When the Dipsey, the little submarine vessel which had started to make its way to the north
pole under the ice of the arctic regions, had sunk out of sight under the waters, it carried
a very quiet and earnestly observant party.  Every one seemed anxious to know what would happen
next, and all those whose duties would allow them to do so gathered under the great skylight
in the upper deck, and gazed upward at the little glass bulb on the surface of the water, which
they were towing by means of an electric wire; and every time a light was flashed into this
bulb it seemed to them as if they were for an instant reunited to that vast open world outside
of the ocean.  When at last the glass globe was exploded, as a signal that the Dipsey had cut
loose from all ties which connected her with the outer world, they saw through the water above
them the flash and the sparks, and then all was darkness.

This is an atom: 
The interior of the submarine vessel was brightly lighted by electric lamps, and the souls
of the people inside of her soon began to brighten under the influence of their work and the
interest they took in their novel undertaking; there was, however, one exception--the soul
of Mrs. Block did not brighten.

This is an atom: 
Mrs. Sarah Block was a peculiar person; she was her husband's second wife, and was about forty
years of age.  Her family were country people, farmers, and her life as a child was passed
among folk as old-fashioned as if they had lived in the past century, and had brought their
old-fashioned ideas with them into this.  But Sarah did not wish to be old-fashioned.  She
sympathized with the social movements of the day; she believed in inventions and progress;
she went to school and studied a great deal which her parents never heard of, and which she
very promptly forgot.  When she grew up she wore the widest hoop-skirts; she was one of the
first to use an electric spinning-wheel; and when she took charge of her father's house, she
it was who banished to the garret the old-fashioned sewing-machine, and the bicycles on which
some of the older members of the family once used to ride.  She tried to persuade her father
to use a hot-air plough, and to give up the practice of keeping cows in an age when milk and
butter were considered not only unnecessary, but injurious to human health. When she married
Samuel Block, then a man of forty-five, she really thought she did so because he was a person
of progressive ideas, but the truth was she married him because he loved her, and because he
did it in an honest, old-fashioned way.

This is an atom: 
In her inner soul Sarah was just as old-fashioned as anybody--she had been born so, and she
had never changed.  Endeavor as she might to make herself believe that she was a woman of modern
thought and feeling, her soul was truly in sympathy with the social fashions and customs in
which she had been brought up; and those to which she was trying to educate herself were on
the outside of her, never a part of her, but always the objects of her aspirations.  These
aspirations she believed to be principles. She tried to set her mind upon the unfolding revelations
of the era, as young women in her grandfather's day used to try to set their minds upon Browning.
When Sarah told Mr. Clewe that she was going on the Dipsey because she would not let her husband
go by himself, she did so because she was ashamed to say that she was in such sympathy with
the great scientific movements of the day that she thought it was her duty to associate herself
with one of them; but while she thought she was lying in the line of high principle, she was
in fact expressing the truthful affection of her old-fashioned nature--a nature she was always
endeavoring to keep out of sight, but which from its dark corner ruled her life.

This is an atom: 
She had an old-fashioned temper, which delighted in censoriousness.  The more interest she
took in anything, the more alive was she to its defects.  She tried to be a good member of
her church, but she said sharp things of the congregation.

This is an atom: 
No electrical illumination could brighten the soul of Mrs. Block. She moved about the little
vessel with a clouded countenance. She was impressed with the feeling that something was wrong,
even now at the beginning, although of course she could not be expected to know what it was.

This is an atom: 
At the bows, and in various places at the sides of the vessel, and even in the bottom, were
large plates of heavy glass, through which the inmates could look out into the water, and there
streamed forward into the quiet depths of the ocean a great path of light, proceeding from
a powerful searchlight in the bow.  By this light any object in the water could be seen some
time before reaching it; but to guard more thoroughly against the most dreaded obstacle they
feared to meet--down-reaching masses of ice--a hydraulic thermometer, mounted on a little submarine
vessel connected with the Dipsey by wires, preceded her a long distance ahead.  Impelled and
guided by the batteries of the larger vessel, this little thermometer-boat would send back
instant tidings of any changes in temperature in the water occasioned by the proximity of ice.
To prevent sinking too deep, a heavy lead, on which were several electric buttons, hung far
below the Dipsey, ready at all times, day or night, to give notice if she came too near the
reefs and sands of the bottom of the Arctic Ocean.

This is an atom: 
The steward had just announced that the first meal on board the Dipsey was ready for the officers'
mess, when Mrs. Block suddenly rushed into the cabin.

This is an atom: 
"Look here, Sammy," she exclaimed; "I want you, or somebody who knows more than you do, to
tell me how the people on this vessel are goin' to get air to breathe with.  It has just struck
me that when we have breathed up all the air that's inside, we will simply suffocate, just
as if we were drowned outside a boat instead of inside; and for my part I can't see any difference,
except in one case we keep dry and in the other we are wet."

This is an atom: 
"More than that, madam," said Mr. Gibbs, the Master Electrician, who, in fact, occupied the
rank of first officer of the vessel; "if we are drowned outside in the open water we shall
be food for fishes, whereas if we suffocate inside the vessel we shall only be food for reflection,
if anybody ever finds us."

This is an atom: 
"You did not come out expectin' that, I hope?" said Mrs. Block. "I thought something would
happen when we started, but I never supposed we would run short of air."

This is an atom: 
"Don't bother yourself about that, Sarah," said Sammy.  "We'll have all the air we want; of
course we would not start without thinkin' of that."

This is an atom: 
"I don't know," said Sarah.  "It's very seldom that men start off anywhere without forgettin'
somethin'."

This is an atom: 
"Let us take our seats, Mrs. Block," said Mr. Gibbs, "and I will set your mind at rest on the
air point.  There are a great many machines and mechanical arrangements on board here which
of course you don't understand, but which I shall take great pleasure in explaining to you
whenever you want to learn something about them. Among them are two great metal contrivances,
outside the Dipsey and near her bows, which open into the water, and also communicate with
the inside of her hull.  These are called electric gills, and they separate air from the water
around us in a manner somewhat resembling the way in which a fish's gills act.  They continually
send in air enough to supply us not only with all we need for breathing, but with enough to
raise us to the surface of the water whenever we choose to produce it in sufficient quantities."

This is an atom: 
"I am glad to hear it," said Mrs. Block, "and I hope the machines will never get out of order.
But I should think that sort of air, made fresh from the water, would be very damp.  It's very
different from the air we are used to, which is warmed by the sun and properly aired."

This is an atom: 
"Aired air seems funny to me," remarked Sammy.

This is an atom: 
There was fascination, not at all surprising, about the great glass lights in the Dipsey, and
whenever a man was off duty he was pretty sure to be at one of these windows if he could get
there.  At first Mrs. Block was afraid to look out of any of them.  It made her blood creep,
she said, to stare out into all that solemn water.  For the first two days, when she could
get no one to talk to her, she passed most of her time sitting in the cabin, holding in one
of her hands a dustbrush, and in the other a farmer's almanac.  She did not use the brush,
nor did she read the almanac, but they reminded her of home and the world which was real.

This is an atom: 
But when she did make up her mind to look out of the windows, she became greatly interested,
especially at the bow, where she could gaze out into the water illuminated by the long lane
of light thrown out by the search-light.  Here she continually imagined she saw things, and
sometimes greatly startled the men on lookout by her exclamations.  Once she thought she saw
a floating corpse, but fortunately it was Sammy who was by her when she proclaimed her discovery,
and he did not believe in any such nonsense, suggesting that it might have been some sort of
a fish.  After that the idea of fish filled the mind of Mrs. Block, and she set herself to
work to search in an encyclopaedia which was on board for descriptions of fishes which inhabited
the depths of the arctic seas.  To meet a whale, she thought, would be very bad, but then a
whale is clumsy and soft; a sword-fish was what she most dreaded.  A sword-fish running his
sword through one of the glass windows, and perhaps coming in himself along with the water,
sent a chill down her back every time she thought about it and talked about it.

This is an atom: 
"You needn't be afraid of sword-fishes," said Captain Jim Hubbell.  "They don't fancy the cold
water we are sailin' in; and as to whales, don't you know, madam, there ain't no more of 'em?"

This is an atom: 
"No more whales!" exclaimed Sarah.  "I have heard about 'em all my life!"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, you can read and hear about 'em easy enough," replied Captain Jim, "but you nor nobody
else will ever see none of 'em ag'in--at least, in this part of the world.  Sperm-whales began
gittin' scarce when I was a boy, and pretty soon there was nothin' left but bow-head or right
whales, that tried to keep out of the way of human bein's by livin' far up North; but when
they came to shootin' 'em with cannons which would carry three or four miles, the whale's day
was up, and he got scarcer and scarcer, until he faded out altogether.  There was a British
vessel, the Barkright, that killed two bow-head whales in 1935, north of Melville Island, but
since that time there hasn't been a whale seen in all the arctic waters. I have heard that
said by sailors, and I have read about it.  They have all been killed, and nothin' left of
'em but the skeletons that's in the museums."

This is an atom: 
Mrs. Block shuddered.  "It would be terrible to meet a livin' one, and yet it is an awful thought
to think that they are all dead and gone," said she.

CHAPTER VI

This is an atom: 
VOICES FROM THE POLAR SEAS

This is an atom: 
Although Sammy Block and his companions were not only far up among the mysteries of the region
of everlasting ice, and were sunk out of sight, so that their vessel had become one of these
mysteries, it was still perfectly possible for them to communicate, by means of the telegraphic
wire which was continually unrolling astern, with people all over the world.  But this communication
was a matter which required great judgment and caution, and it had been a subject of very careful
consideration by Roland Clewe.

This is an atom: 
When he had returned to Cape Tariff, after parting with the Dipsey, he had received several
messages from Sammy, which assured him that the submarine voyage was proceeding satisfactorily.
But when he went on board the Go Lightly and started homeward, he would be able to hear nothing
more from the submarine voyagers until he reached St. John's, Newfoundland--the first place
at which his vessel would touch.  Of course constant communication with Sardis would be kept
up, but this communication might be the source of great danger to the plans of Roland Clewe.
Whatever messages of importance came from the depths of the arctic regions he wished to come
only to him or to Mrs. Raleigh.  He had contrived a telegraphic cipher, known only to Mrs.
Raleigh, Sammy, and two officers of the Dipsey, and, to insure secrecy, Sammy had been strictly
enjoined to send no information in any other way than in this cipher.

This is an atom: 
For years there had been men, both in America and in Europe, who had been watching with jealous
scrutiny the inventions and researches of Roland Clewe, and he well understood that if they
should discover his processes and plans before they were brought to successful completion he
must expect to be robbed of many of the results of his labors.  The first news that came to
him on his recent return to America had been the tale told by Sammy Block, of the man in the
air who had been endeavoring to peer down into his lens-house, and he had heard of other attempts
of this kind.  Therefore it was that the telegraphic instrument on the Dipsey had been given
into the sole charge of Samuel Block, who had become a very capable operator, and who could
be relied upon to send no news over his wire which could give serviceable information to the
operators along the line from Cape Tariff to Sardis, New Jersey.

This is an atom: 
But Clewe did not in the least desire that Margaret Raleigh should be kept waiting until he
came back from the arctic regions for news from the expedition, which she as well as himself
had sent out into the unknown North.  Consequently Samuel Block had been told that he might
communicate with Mrs. Raleigh as soon and as often as he pleased, remembering always to be
careful never to send any word which might reveal anything to the detriment of his employers.
When a message should be received on board the Dipsey that Mr. Clewe was ready to communicate
with her, frequent reports were expected from the Master Electrician, but it would be Sammy
who would unlock the cover which had been placed over the instrument.

This is an atom: 
Before he retired to his bunk on the first night on board the Dipsey, Sammy thought it proper
to send a message to Mrs. Raleigh.  He had not telegraphed before because he knew that Mr.
Clewe would communicate fully before he left Cape Tariff.

This is an atom: 
Margaret Raleigh had gone to bed late, and had been lying for an hour or two unable to sleep,
so busy was her mind with the wonderful things which were happening in the far-away polar regions--strange
and awful things--in which she had such a direct and lively interest.  She had heard, from
Roland Clewe, of the successful beginning of the Dipsey's voyage, and before she had gone to
her chamber she had received a last message from him on leaving Cape Tariff; and now, as she
lay there in her bed, her whole soul was occupied with thoughts of that little party of people--some
of them so well known to her--all of them sent out upon this perilous and frightful expedition
by her consent and assistance, and now left alone to work their way through the dread and silent
waters that underlie the awful ice regions of the pole. She felt that so long as she had a
mind she could not help thinking of them, and so long as she thought of them she could not sleep.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly there was a ring at the door, which made her start and spring from her bed, and shortly
a telegraphic message was brought to her by a maid.  It was from the depths of the Arctic Ocean,
and read as follows:

This is an atom: 
"Getting on very well.  No motion.  Not cold.  Slight rheumatism in Sarah's shoulder.  Wants
to know which side of plasters you gave her goes next skin,

This is an atom: 
"SAMUEL BLOCK."

This is an atom: 
An hour afterwards there flashed farther northward than ever current from a battery had gone
before an earnest, cordial, almost affectionate message from Margaret Raleigh to Sarah Block,
and it concluded with the information that it was the rough side of the plasters which should
go next to the skin.  After that Mrs. Raleigh went to bed with a peaceful mind and slept soundly.

This is an atom: 
Frequent communications, always of a friendly or domestic nature, passed between the polar
sea and Sardis during the next few days. Mrs. Raleigh would have telegraphed a good deal more
than she did had it not been for the great expense from Sardis to Cape Tariff, and Sarah Block
was held in restraint, not by pecuniary considerations, but by Sammy's sense of the fitness
of things. He nearly always edited her messages, even when he consented to send them.  One
communication he positively refused to transmit. She came to him in a great flurry.

This is an atom: 
"Sammy," said she, "I have just found out something, and I can't rest until I have told Mrs.
Raleigh.  I won't mention it here, because it might frighten some people into fits and spasms.
Sammy, do you know there are thirteen people on board this boat?"

This is an atom: 
"Sarah Block!" ejaculated her husband, "what in the name of common-sense are you talkin' about?
What earthly difference can it make whether there are thirteen people on this vessel or twelve?
And if it did make any difference, what are you goin' to do about it?  Do you expect anybody
to get out?"

This is an atom: 
"Of course I don't," replied Sarah; "although there are some of them that would not have come
in if I had had my say about it; but as Mrs. Raleigh is one of the owners, and such a good
friend to you and me, Sammy, it is our duty to let her know what dreadful bad luck we are carryin'
with us."

This is an atom: 
"Don't you suppose she knows how many people are aboard?" said Sammy.

This is an atom: 
"Of course she knows; but she don't consider what it means, or we wouldn't all have been here.
It is her right to know, Sammy. Perhaps she might order us to go back to Cape Tariff and put
somebody ashore."

This is an atom: 
In his heart Samuel Block believed that if this course were adopted he was pretty sure who
would be put on shore, if a vote were taken by officers and crew; but he was too wise to say
anything upon this point, and contented himself with positively refusing to send southward
any news of the evil omen.

This is an atom: 
The next day Mrs. Block felt that she must speak upon the subject or perish, and she asked
Mr. Gibbs what he thought of there being thirteen people on board.

This is an atom: 
"Madam," said he, "these signs lose all their powers above the seventieth parallel of latitude.
In fact, none of them have ever been known to come true above sixty-eight degrees and forty
minutes, and we are a good deal higher than that, you know."

This is an atom: 
Sarah made no answer, but she told her husband afterwards that she thought that Mr. Gibbs had
his mind so full of electricity that it had no room for old-fashioned common-sense.  It did
not do to sneer at signs and portents.  Among the earliest things she remembered was a story
which had been told her of her grandmother's brother, who was the thirteenth passenger in an
omnibus when he was a young man, and who died that very night, having slipped off the back
step, where he was obliged to stand, and fractured his skull.

This is an atom: 
At last there came a day when a message in cipher from Roland Clewe delivered itself on board
the Dipsey, and from that moment a hitherto unknown sense of security seemed to pervade the
minds of officers and crew.  To be sure, there was no good reason for this, for if disaster
should overtake them, or even threaten them, there was no submarine boat ready to send to their
rescue; and if there had been, it would be long, long before such aid could reach them; but
still, they were comforted, encouraged, and cheered.  Now, if anything happened, they could
send news of it to the man in whom they all trusted, and through him to their homes, and whatever
their far-away friends had to say to them could be said without reserve.

This is an atom: 
There was nothing yet of definite scientific importance to report, but the messages of the
Master Electrician were frequent and long, regardless of expense, and, so far as her husband
would permit her, Sarah Block informed Mrs. Raleigh of the discouragements and dangers which
awaited this expedition.  It must be said, however, that Mrs. Block never proposed to send
back one word which should indicate that she was in favor of the abandonment of the expedition,
or of her retirement from it should opportunity allow. She had set out for the north pole because
Sammy was going there, and the longer she went "polin'" with him, the stronger became her curiosity
to see the pole and to know what it looked like.

This is an atom: 
The Dipsey was not expected to be, under any circumstances, a swift vessel, and now, retarded
by her outside attachments, she moved but slowly under the waters.  The telegraphic wire which
she laid as she proceeded was the thinnest and lightest submarine cable ever manufactured,
but the mass of it was of great weight, and as it found its way to the bottom it much retarded
the progress of the vessel, which moved more slowly than was absolutely necessary, for fear
of breaking this connection with the living world.

This is an atom: 
Onward, but a few knots an hour, the Dipsey moved like a fish in the midst of the sea.  The
projectors of the enterprise had a firm belief that there was a channel from Baffin's Bay into
an open polar sea, which would be navigable if its entrance were not blocked up by ice, and
on this belief were based all their hopes of success.  So the explorers pressed steadily onward,
always with an anxious lookout above them for fear of striking the overhanging ice, always
with an anxious lookout below for fear of dangers which might loom up from the bottom, always
with an anxious lookout starboard for fear of running against the foundations of Greenland,
always with an anxious lookout to port for fear of striking the groundwork of the unknown land
to the west, and always keeping a lookout in every direction for whatever revelation these
unknown waters might choose to make to them.

This is an atom: 
Captain Jim Hubbell had no sympathy with the methods of navigation practised on board the Dipsey.
So long as he could not go out on deck and take his noon observations, he did not believe it
would be possible for him to know exactly where his vessel was; but he accepted the situation,
and objected to none of the methods of the scientific navigators.

This is an atom: 
"It's a mighty simple way of sailin'," he said to Sammy.  "As long as there's water to sail
in, you have just got to git on a line of longitude--it doesn't matter what line, so long as
there's water ahead of you--and keep there; and so long as you steer due north, always takin'
care not to switch off to the magnetic pole, of course you will keep there; and as all lines
of longitude come to the same point at last, and as that's the point you are sailin' for, of
course, if you can keep on that line of longitude as long as it lasts, it follows that you
are bound to git there.  If you come to any place on this line of longitude where there's not
enough water to sail her, you have got to stop her; and then, if you can't see any way of goin'
ahead on another line of longitude, you can put her about and go out of this on the same line
of longitude that you came up into it on, and so you may expect to find a way clear.  It's
mighty simple sailin' --regular spellin' book navigation--but it isn't the right thing."

This is an atom: 
"It seems that way, Cap'n Jim," said Sammy, "and I expect there's a long stretch of underwater
business ahead of us yet, but still we can't tell.  How do we know that we will not get up
some mornin' soon and look out of the upper skylight and see nothin' but water over us and
daylight beyond that?"

This is an atom: 
"When we do that, Sammy," said Captain Jim, "then I'll truly believe I'm on a v'yage!"

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VII

This is an atom: 
GOOD NEWS GOES FROM SARDIS

This is an atom: 
When Roland Clewe, after a voyage from Cape Tariff which would have been tedious to him no
matter how short it had been, arrived at Sardis, his mind was mainly occupied with the people
he had left behind him engulfed in the arctic seas, but this important subject did not prevent
him from also giving attention to the other great object upon which his soul was bent.  At
St. John's, and at various points on his journey from there, he had received messages from
the Dipsey, so that he knew that so far all was well, and when he met Mrs. Raleigh she had
much to tell him of what might have been called the domestic affairs of the little vessel.

This is an atom: 
But while keeping himself in touch, as it were, with the polar regions, Roland Clewe longed
to use the means he believed he possessed of peering into the subterranean mysteries of the
earth beneath him.  Work on the great machine by which he would generate his Artesian ray had
been going on very satisfactorily, and there was every reason to believe that he would soon
be able to put it into operation.

This is an atom: 
He had found Margaret Raleigh a different woman from what she had been when he left her.

This is an atom: 
The absence had been short, but the change in her was very perceptible.  She was quieter; she
was more intent.  She had always taken a great interest in his undertakings, but now that interest
not only seemed to be deepened, but it was clouded by a certain anxiety.  She had been an ardent,
cheerful, and hopeful co-worker with him, so far as she was able to do so; but now, although
she was quite as ardent, the cheerfulness had disappeared, and she did not allude to the hopefulness.

This is an atom: 
But this did not surprise Clewe; he thought it the most natural thing in the world; for that
polar expedition was enough to cloud the spirits of any woman who had an active part and share
in it, and who was bound to feel that much of the responsibility of it rested upon her.  At
times this responsibility rested very heavily upon himself.  But if thoughts of that little
submerged party at the desolate end of the world came to him as he sat in his comfortable chair,
and a cold dread shot through him, as it was apt to do at such times, he would hurriedly step
to his telegraphic instrument, and when he had heard from Sammy Block that all was well with
them, his spirits would rise again, and he would go on with his work with a soul cheered and
encouraged.

This is an atom: 
But good news from the North did not appear to cheer and encourage the soul of Mrs. Raleigh.
She seemed anxious and troubled even after she had heard it.

This is an atom: 
"Mr. Clewe," said she, when he had called upon her the next morning after his return, "suppose
you were to hear bad news from the Dipsey, or were to hear nothing at all--were to get no answer
to your messages--what would you do?"

This is an atom: 
His face grew troubled.

This is an atom: 
"That is a terrible question," he said.  "It is one I have often asked myself; but there is
no satisfactory answer to it.  Of course, as I have told myself and have told you, there seems
no reason to expect a disaster.  There are no storms in the quiet depths in which the Dipsey
is sailing.  Ice does not sink down from the surface, and even if a floating iceberg should
turn over, as they sometimes do in the more open sea, the Dipsey will keep low enough to avoid
such danger.  In fact, I feel almost sure that if she should meet with any obstacle which would
prevent her from keeping on her course to the pole, all she would have to do would be to turn
around and come back.  As to the possibility of receiving no messages, I should conclude in
that case that the wire had broken, and should wait a few days before allowing myself to be
seriously alarmed.  We have provided against such an accident.  The Dipsey is equipped as a
cable-laying vessel, and if her broken wire is not at too great a depth, she could recover
it; but I have given orders that should such an accident occur, and they cannot reestablish
communication, they must return."

This is an atom: 
"Where to?" asked Mrs. Raleigh.

This is an atom: 
"To Cape Tariff, of course.  The Dipsey cannot navigate the surface of the ocean for any considerable
distance."

This is an atom: 
"And then?" she asked.

This is an atom: 
"I would go as quickly as possible to St. John's, where I have arranged that a vessel shall
be ready for me, and I would meet the party at Cape Tariff, and there plan for a resumption
of the enterprise, or bring them home.  If they should not be able to get back to Cape Tariff,
then all is blank before me.  We must not think of it."

This is an atom: 
"But you will go up there all the same?" she said.

This is an atom: 
"Oh yes, I will go there."

This is an atom: 
Mrs. Raleigh made no answer, but sat looking upon the floor.

This is an atom: 
"But why should we trouble ourselves with these fears?" continued Clewe.  "We have considered
all probable dangers and have provided against them, and at this moment everything is going
on admirably, and there is every reason why we should feel hopeful and encouraged.  I am sorry
to see you look so anxious and downcast."

This is an atom: 
"Mr. Clewe," said she, "I have many anxieties; that is natural, and I cannot help it, but there
is only one fear which seriously affects me."

This is an atom: 
"And that makes you pale," said Clewe.  "Are you afraid that if I begin work with the Artesian
ray I shall become so interested in it that I shall forget our friends up there in the North?
There is no danger.  No matter what I might be doing with the ray, I can disconnect the batteries
in an instant, lock up the lens-house, and in the next half-hour start for St. John's.  Then
I will go North if there is anything needed to be done there which human beings can do."

This is an atom: 
She looked at him steadfastly.

This is an atom: 
"That is what I am afraid of," she said.

This is an atom: 
Roland Clewe did not immediately speak.  To him Margaret Raleigh was two persons.  She was
a woman of business, earnest, thoughtful, helpful, generous, and wise; a woman with whom he
worked, consulted, planned, who made it possible for him to carry on the researches and enterprises
to which he had devoted his life.  But, more than this, she was another being; she was a woman
he loved, with a warm, passionate love, which grew day by day, and which a year ago had threatened
to break down every barrier of prudence, and throw him upon his knees before her as a humiliated
creature who had been pretending to love knowledge, philosophy, and science, but in reality
had been loving beauty and riches.  It was the fear of this catastrophe which had had a strong
influence in taking him to Europe.

This is an atom: 
But now, by some magical influence--an influence which he was not sure he understood--that
first woman, the woman of business, his partner, his co-worker, had disappeared, and there
sat before him the woman he loved.  He felt in his soul that if he tried to banish her it would
be impossible; by no word or act could he at this moment bring back the other.

This is an atom: 
"Margaret Raleigh," he said, suddenly, "you have thrown me from my balance.  Yon may not believe
it, you may not be able to imagine the possibility of it, but a spirit, a fiery spirit which
I have long kept bound up within me, has burst its bonds and has taken possession of me.  It
may be a devil or it may be an angel, but it holds me and rules me, and it was set loose by
the words you have just spoken.  It is my love for you, Margaret Raleigh!" He went on, speaking
rapidly.  "Now tell me," said he.  "I have often come to you for advice and help--give it to
me now.  In laboratory, workshop, office, with you and away from you, abroad and at home, by
day and by night, always and everywhere I have loved you, longed for a sight of you, for a
word from you, even if it had been a word about a stick or a pin.  And always and everywhere
I have determined to be true to myself, true to you, true to every principle of honor and common-sense,
and to say nothing to you of love until by some success I have achieved the right to do so.
By words which made me fancy that you showed a personal interest in me, you have banished all
those resolutions; you have--But I am getting madder and madder.  Shall I leave this room?
Shall I swear never to speak--"

This is an atom: 
She looked up at him.  The ashiness had gone out of her face. Her eyes were bright, and as
she lifted them towards him a golden softness and mistiness came into the centre of each of
them, as though he might look down through them into her soul.

This is an atom: 
"If I were you," said she, "I would stay here and say whatever else you have to say."

This is an atom: 
He told her what more he had to say, but it was with his arms around her and his eyes close
to hers.

This is an atom: 
"Do you know," she said, a little afterwards, "that for years, while you have been longing
to get to the pole, to see down into the earth, and to accomplish all the other wonderful things
that you are working at in your shops, I too have been longing to do something--longing hundreds
and hundreds of times when we were talking about batteries and lenses and of the enterprises
we have had on hand."

This is an atom: 
"And what was that?" he asked.

This is an atom: 
"It was to push back this lock of hair from your forehead. There, now; you don't know how much
better you look!"

This is an atom: 
Before Clewe left the house it was decided that if in any case it should become necessary for
him to start for the polar regions these two were to be married with all possible promptness,
and they were to go to the North together.

This is an atom: 
That afternoon the happy couple met again and composed a message to the arctic seas.  It was
not deemed necessary yet to announce to society what had happened, but they both felt that
their friends who were so far away, so completely shut out from all relations with the world,
and yet so intimately connected with them, should know that Margaret Raleigh and Roland Clewe
were engaged to be married.

This is an atom: 
Roland sent the message that evening from his office.  He waited an unusually long time for
a reply, but at last it came, from Sammy.  The cipher, when translated, ran as follows:

This is an atom: 
"Everybody as glad as they can be.  Specially Sarah.  Will send regular congratulations.  Private
message soon from me.  We have got the devil on board."

This is an atom: 
Clewe was astonished: Samuel Block was such a quiet, steady person, so unused to extravagance
or excitement, that this sensational message was entirely beyond his comprehension.  He could
fix no possible meaning to it, and he was glad that it did not come when he was in company
with Margaret.  It was too late to disturb her now, and he most earnestly hoped that an explanation
would come before he saw her again.

This is an atom: 
That night he dreamed that there was a great opening near the pole, which was the approach
to the lower regions, and that the Dipsey had been boarded by a diabolical passenger, who had
come to examine her papers and inquire into the health of her passengers and crew.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VIII

This is an atom: 
THE DEVIL ON THE DIPSEY

This is an atom: 
After a troubled night, Roland Clewe rose early.  He had made up his mind that what Sammy had
to communicate was something of a secret, otherwise it would have been telegraphed at once.
For this reason he had not sent him a message asking for immediate and full particulars, but
had waited.  Now, however, he felt he could wait no longer; he must know something definite
before he saw Margaret.  Not to excite suspicion by telegraphing at untimely hours, he had
waited until morning, and as the Dipsey was in about the same longitude as Sardis, and as they
kept regular hours on board, without regard to the day and night of the arctic regions, he
knew that he would not now be likely to rouse anybody from his slumbers by "calling up" the pole.

This is an atom: 
Although the telephone had been brought to such wonderful perfection in these days, Roland
Clewe had never thought of using it for purposes of communication with the Dipsey.  The necessary
wire would have been too heavy, and his messages could not have been kept secret.  In fact,
this telegraphic communication between Sardis and the submarine vessel was almost as primitive
as that in use in the latter part of the nineteenth century.

This is an atom: 
But Clewe had scarcely entered the office when he was surprised by the sound of the instrument,
and he soon found that Sammy was calling to him from the polar seas.  He sat down instantly
and received this message:

This is an atom: 
"Could not send more last night.  Gibbs came in.  Did not want him to know until I had heard
from you.  That Pole, Rovinski, is on board.  Never knew it until yesterday.  Had shaved off
his beard and had his head cropped.  He let it grow, and I spotted him.  There is no mistake.
I know him, but he has not found it out.  He is on board to get ahead of you some way or other
--perhaps get up a mutiny and go to the pole himself.  He is the wickedest-looking man I ever
saw, and he scared me when I first recognized him.  Will send news as long as I am on hand.
Let me know what you think.  I want to chuck him into the scuttle-box.

This is an atom: 
"SAMUEL BLOCK."

This is an atom: 
"If that could be done," said Clewe to himself, "it would be an end to a great many troubles."

This is an atom: 
The scuttle-box on the submarine vessel was a contrivance for throwing things overboard.  It
consisted of a steel box about six feet long and two feet square at the ends, and with a tightly
fitting door at each extremity.  When this scuttle-box was used it was run down through a square
opening in the bottom of the Dipsey, the upper door was opened, matter to be disposed of was
thrown into it, the upper door was shut and the lower one opened, whereupon everything inside
of it descended into the sea, and water filled the box.  When this box was drawn up by means
of its machinery, the water was forced out, so that when it was entirely inside the vessel
it was empty, and then the lower door was closed.  For some moments the idea suggested by Sammy
was very attractive to Clewe, and he could not help thinking that the occasion might arise
when it would be perfectly proper to carry it into execution.

This is an atom: 
Now that he knew the import of Sammy's extraordinary communication, he felt that it would not
be right to withhold his knowledge from Margaret.  Of course it might frighten her very much,
but this was an enterprise in which people should expect to be frightened.  Full confidence
and hearty assistance were what these two now expected from each other.

This is an atom: 
"What is it exactly that you fear?" she asked, when she had heard the news.

This is an atom: 
"That is hard to say," replied Roland.  "This man Rovinski is a scientific jackal; he has ambitions
of the very highest kind, and he seeks to gratify them by fraud and villainy.  It is now nearly
two years since I have found out that he has been shadowing me, endeavoring to discover what
I am doing and how I am doing it; and the moment he does get a practical and working knowledge
of anything, he will go on with the business on my lines as far as he can.  Perhaps he may
succeed, and, in any case, he will be almost certain to ruin my chances of success--that is,
if I were not willing to buy him off.  He would be pretty sure to try blackmail if he found
he could not make good use of the knowledge he had stolen."

This is an atom: 
"The wretch!" cried Margaret.  "Do you suppose he hopes to snatch from you the discovery of
the pole?"

This is an atom: 
"That seems obvious," replied Roland, "and it's what Sammy thinks.  It is the greatest pity
in the world he was not discovered before he got on the Dipsey."

This is an atom: 
"But what can you do?" cried Margaret.

This is an atom: 
"I cannot imagine," he replied, "unless I recall the Dipsey to Cape Tariff, and go up there
and have him apprehended."

This is an atom: 
"Couldn't he be apprehended where he is?" she asked.  "There are enough men on board to capture
him and shut him up somewhere where he could do no harm."

This is an atom: 
"I have thought of that," answered Roland, "but it would be a very difficult and delicate thing
to do.  The men we have on board the Dipsey are trusty fellows--at least, I thought so when
they were engaged--but there is no knowing what mutinous poison this Pole may have infused
into their minds.  If one of their number should be handcuffed and shut up without good reason
being given, they might naturally rebel, and it would be very hard to give satisfactory reasons
for arresting Rovinski.  Even Gibbs might object to such harshness upon grounds which might
seem to him vague and insufficient.  Sammy knows Rovinski, I know him, but the others do not,
and it might be difficult to convince them that he is the black-hearted scoundrel we think
him; so we must be very careful what we do."

This is an atom: 
"As to calling the Dipsey back," said Margaret, "I would not do it; I would take the risks."

This is an atom: 
"I think you are right," said Clewe.  "I have a feeling that if they come back to Cape Tariff
they will not go out again.  Some of the men may be discouraged already, and it would produce
a bad impression upon all of them to turn back for some reason which they did not understand,
or for a reason such as we could give them.  I would not like to have to bring them back, now
that they are getting on so well."

This is an atom: 
In the course of the morning there came from the officers, men, and passenger of the Dipsey
a very cordial and pleasant message to Mr. Clewe and Mrs. Raleigh, congratulating them upon
the happy event of which they had been informed.  Sarah Block insisted on sending a supplementary
message for herself, in which she was privately congratulatory to as great an extent as her
husband would allow her to go, and which ended with a hope that if they lived to be married
they would content themselves with doing their explorations on solid ground.  She did not want
to come back until she had seen the pole, but some of her ideas about that kind of travelling
were getting to be a good deal more fixed than they had been.

This is an atom: 
The advice which Roland Clewe gave to Samuel Block was simple enough and perhaps unnecessary,
but there was noshing else for him to say.  He urged that the strictest watch be kept on Rovinski;
that he should never be allowed to go near the telegraph instrument; and if, by insubordination
or any bad conduct, a pretext for his punishment should offer itself, he should be immediately
shut up where he could not communicate with the men.  It was very important to keep him as
much as possible in ignorance of what was going on and of what should be accomplished; that,
after all, was the main point.  If the pole should be discovered, Rovinski must have nothing
to do with it. Sammy replied that everything should he reported as soon as it turned up, and
any orders received from Mr. Clewe should be carried out so long as he was alive to help carry
them.

This is an atom: 
"Now," said Roland to Margaret, "there's nothing more that we can do in regard to that affair.
As soon as there are any new developments we shall have to consider it again, but until then
let us give up our whole souls to each other and the Artesian ray."

This is an atom: 
"It seems to me," said she, "that if we could have discovered a good while ago some sort of
ray by which we could see into each other's souls, we should have gained a great many hours
which are now lost."

This is an atom: 
"Not at all," replied Clewe; "they are not lost.  In our philosophy, nothing is lost.  All
the joys we have missed in days that are past shall be crowded into the days that are to come."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER IX

This is an atom: 
THE ARTESIAN RAY

This is an atom: 
In less than a week after the engagement of Roland Clewe and Margaret Raleigh work on the great
machine which was to generate the Artesian ray had so far progressed that it was possible to
make some preliminary experiments with it.  Although Clewe was sorry to think of the very undesirable
companion which Samuel Block had carried with him into the polar regions, he could not but
feel a certain satisfaction when he reflected that there was now no danger of Rovinski gaining
any knowledge of the momentous operations which he had in hand in Sardis.  He had had frequent
telegrams from Sammy, but no trouble of any kind had yet arisen. It was true that the time
for trouble, if there were to be any, had probably not yet arrived, but Clewe could not afford
to disturb his mind with anticipations of disagreeable things which might happen.

This is an atom: 
The masses of lenses, batteries, tubes, and coils which constituted the new instrument had
been set up in the lens-house, and it was with this invention that Clewe had succeeded in producing
that new form of light which would not only penetrate any material substance, but illuminate
and render transparent everything through which it passed, and which would, it was hoped, extend
itself into the earth to a depth only limited by the electric power used to generate it.

This is an atom: 
Margaret was very anxious to be present at the first experiment, but Clewe was not willing
that this should be.

This is an atom: 
"It is almost certain," he said, "that there will be failures at first, not caused perhaps
by any radical defects in the apparatus, but by some minor fault in some part of it.  This
almost always happens in a new machine, and then there are uninteresting work and depressing
waiting.  As soon as I see that my invention will act as I want it to act, I shall have you
in the lens-house with me.  We may not be able to do very much at first, but when I really
begin to do anything I want both of us to see it done."

This is an atom: 
There was no flooring in that part of the lens-house where the machine was set up, for Clewe
wished his new light to operate directly upon the earth.  At about eight feet above the ground
was the opening through which the Artesian ray would pass perpendicularly downward whenever
the lever should be moved which would connect the main electric current.

This is an atom: 
When all was ready, Clewe sent every one, even Bryce, the master-workman, from the room.  If
his invention should totally fail, he wanted no one but himself to witness that failure; but
if it should succeed, or even give promise of doing so, he would be glad to have the eyes of
his trusted associates witness that success.  When the doors were shut and locked, Clewe moved
a lever, and a disk of light three feet in diameter immediately appeared upon the ground. 
It was a colorless light, but it seemed to give a more vivid hue to everything it shone upon--such
as the little stones, a piece of wood half embedded in the earth, grains of sand, and pieces
of mortar.  In a few seconds, however, these things all disappeared, and there revealed itself
to the eyes of Clewe a perfectly smooth surface of brown earth.  This continued for some little
time, now and then a rounded or a flattened stone appearing in it, and then gradually fading away.

This is an atom: 
As Clewe stared intently down upon the illuminated space, the brown earth seemed to melt and
disappear, and he gazed upon a surface of fine sand, dark or yellowish, thickly interspersed
with gravel-stones.  This appearance changed, and a large rounded stone was seen almost in
the centre of the glowing disk.  The worn and smooth surface of the stone faded away, and he
beheld what looked like a split section of a cobble-stone.  Then it disappeared altogether,
and there was another flat surface of gravel and sand.

This is an atom: 
Between himself and the illuminated space on which he gazed--his breath quick and his eyes
widely distended--there seemed to be nothing at all.  To all appearances he was looking into
a cylindrical hole a few feet deep.  Everything between the bottom of this hole and himself
was invisible; the light had made intervening substances transparent, and had deprived them
of color and outlines.  It was as though he looked through air.

This is an atom: 
Then his eyes fell upon the sides of this cylindrical opening, and these, illuminated, but
not otherwise acted upon by the volume of Artesian rays, showed, in all their true colors and
forms, everything which went to make up the sides of the bright cavity into which he looked.
He saw the various strata of clay, sand, gravel, exactly as he would have seen them in a circular
hole cut accurately and smoothly into the earth.  No stone or lump protruded from the side
of this apparent excavation, the inner surface of which was as smooth as if it had been cut
down with a sharp instrument.

This is an atom: 
Clewe was frightened.  Was it possible that this could be an imaginary cavity into which he
was looking?  He drew back; he was about to put out one foot to feel if it were really solid
ground upon which this light was pouring, but he refrained.  He got a long stick, and with
it touched the centre of the light.  What he felt was hard and solid; the end of the stick
seemed to melt, and this startled him.  He pulled back the stick--he could go on no further
by himself.  He must have somebody in here with him; he must have the testimony of some other
eyes; he needed the company of a man with a cool and steady brain.

This is an atom: 
He ran to the door and called Bryce.  When the master-workman had entered and the door had
been locked behind him, he exclaimed, "How pale you are!  Does it work?"

This is an atom: 
"I think so," said Clewe; "but perhaps I am crazy and only imagine it.  You see that circular
patch of light upon the ground there?  I want you to go close to it and look down upon it,
and tell me what you see."

This is an atom: 
Bryce stepped quickly to the illuminated space.  He looked down at it; then he approached nearer;
then he carefully placed his feet by its edge and leaned over further, gazing intently downward,
and he exclaimed, "Good heavens!  How did you make the hole?"

This is an atom: 
At that moment he heard a groan, and, looking across the illuminated space, he saw Clewe tottering.
In the next moment he was stretched upon the ground in a dead faint.

This is an atom: 
When Bryce had hurried to the side of his employer and had thrown a pitcher of water over him,
it was not long before Clewe revived.  In answer to Bryce's inquiries he simply replied that
he supposed he had been too much excited by the success of his work.

This is an atom: 
"You see," said he, "that was not a hole at all that you were looking into; it was the solid
earth made transparent by the Artesian ray.  The thing works perfectly.  Please step to that
lever and turn it off.  I can stand no more at present."

This is an atom: 
Bryce moved the lever, and the light upon the ground disappeared. He approached the place where
it had been; it was nothing but common earth.  He put his foot upon it; he stamped; it was
as solid as any other part of the State.

This is an atom: 
"And yet I have looked down into it," he ejaculated, "at least half a dozen feet!"

This is an atom: 
When Bryce turned and went back to Clewe, he too was pale.

This is an atom: 
"I do not wonder you fainted," said he.  "I do not believe it was what you saw that upset you;
it was what you expected to see --wasn't that it?"

This is an atom: 
Clewe nodded in an indefinite way.  "We won't talk about it now," said he.  "I don't want any
more experiments to-day.  We will cover up the instrument and go."

This is an atom: 
When Roland Clewe reached his room, he sat down in the arm-chair to think.  He had made a grand
and wonderful success, but it was not upon that that his mind was now fixed.  It was upon the
casual and accidental effect of the work of his invention, of which he had never dreamed. 
Bryce had made a great mistake in thinking that it was not what Roland Clewe had seen, but
what he had expected to see, which had caused him to drop insensible.  It was what he had seen.

This is an atom: 
When the master-workman had approached the lighted space upon the ground, Clewe stood opposite
to him, a little distance from the apparatus.  As Bryce looked down, he leaned forward more
and more, until the greater part of his body was directly over the lighted space.  Looking
at him, Clewe was startled, amazed, and horrified to find all that portion of his person which
projected itself into the limits of the light had entirely disappeared, and that he was gazing
upon a section of a man's trunk, brightly illuminated, and displayed in all its internal colors
and outlines.  Such a sight was enough to take away the senses of any man, and he did not wonder
that he had fainted.

This is an atom: 
"Now," said he to himself, "all the time that I was looking into that apparent hole, never
thinking that in order to see down into it I was obliged to project a portion of myself into
the line of the Artesian ray, that portion of me was transparent, invisible. If Bryce had come
in! and then"--as the thought came into his mind his heart stopped beating--"if Margaret had
been there!"

This is an atom: 
For an hour he sat in his chair, racking his brain.

This is an atom: 
"She must see the working of the ray," he said.  "I must tell her of my success.  She must
see it as soon as possible.  It is cruel to keep her waiting.  But how shall I manage it? 
How shall I shield her from the slightest possibility of what happened to me? Heavens!" he
exclaimed, "if she had been there!"

This is an atom: 
After a time he determined that before any further experiments should take place he would build
a circular screen, a little room, which should entirely surround the space on which the Artesian
ray was operated.  Only one person at a time should be allowed to enter this screened apartment,
which should then be closed.  It would make no difference if one should become invisible, provided
there was no one else to know it.

This is an atom: 
It was on the evening of the next day that Margaret beheld the action of the Artesian ray.
She greatly objected at first to going inside of the screened space by herself, and urged Roland
to accompany her; but this he stoutly refused to do, assuring her that it was essential for
but one person at a time to view the action of the ray.  She demurred a good deal, but at last
consented to allow herself to be shut up within the screen.

This is an atom: 
What Margaret saw was different from the gradual excavation which had revealed itself before
the eyes of Roland. She looked immediately into a hole nearly ten feet deep. The action of
the apparatus was such that the power of penetration gained by the ray during its operation
at any time was retained, so that when the current was shut off the photic boring ceased, and
recommenced when the batteries were again put into action at the point where it had left off.
The moment Margaret looked down she gave a little cry, and started back against the screen.
She was afraid she would fall in.

This is an atom: 
"Roland," she exclaimed, "you don't mean to say that this is not really an opening into the earth?"

This is an atom: 
He was near her on the other side of the screen, and he explained to her the action of the
light.  Over and over she asked him to come inside and tell her what it was she saw, but he
always refused.

This is an atom: 
"The bottom is beautifully smooth and gray," she exclaimed; "what is that?"

This is an atom: 
"Sand," said Roland.

This is an atom: 
"And now it is white, like a piece of pottery," she exclaimed.

This is an atom: 
"That is white clay," said he.

This is an atom: 
"Don't you want to take my place," said she, "if you will not come with me?"

This is an atom: 
"No," said Roland.  "Look down as long as you wish; I know pretty well what you will see for
some time to come.  Has there been any change?"

This is an atom: 
"The bottom is still white," she replied, "but it is glittering."

This is an atom: 
"That is white sand," said he.  "The Artesian well which supplies the works revealed to me
long ago the character of the soil at this spot, so that for a hundred feet or more I know
what we may expect to see."

This is an atom: 
She came out hurriedly.  "When you begin to speak of wells," she said, "I am frightened.  If
I should see water, I should lose my head."  She sat down and put her hand before her eyes.
"My brain is dazzled," she said.  "I don't feel strong enough to believe what I have seen."

This is an atom: 
Roland shut off the current and opened the screen.  "Come here, Margaret," he said; "this is
the spot upon which the light was shining.  I think it will do you good to look at it.  Tread
upon it; it will help to reassure you that the things about us are real."

This is an atom: 
Margaret was silent for a few moments, and then, approaching Roland, she took him by both hands.
"You have succeeded," said she; "you are the greatest discoverer of this age!"

This is an atom: 
"My dear Margaret," he interrupted, quickly, "do not let us talk in that way; we have only
just begun to work.  Above all things, do not let us get excited.  If everything works properly,
it will not be long before I can send the Artesian ray down into depths with which I am not
acquainted--how far I do not know--but we must wait and see what is the utmost we can do. 
When we have reached that point, it will be in order to hoist our flags and blow our trumpets.
I hope it will not be long before the light descends so deep that we shall be obliged to use
a telescope."

This is an atom: 
"And will it not be possible, Roland," Margaret said, earnestly, "that we shall ever look down
into the earth together?  When the light gets beyond the depth to which people have dug and
bored, I shall never want to stand there alone behind the screen and see what next shall show
itself."

This is an atom: 
"That screen is an awkward affair," said Roland.  "Perhaps I may think of a method by which
it can be done away with, and by which we can stand side by side and look down as far into
the depths of the earth as our Artesian ray can be induced to bore."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER X

This is an atom: 
"LAKE SHIVER"

This is an atom: 
Steadily the Dipsey worked her way northward, and as she moved on her course her progress became
somewhat slower than it had been at first.  This decrease in speed was due partially to extreme
caution on the part of Mr. Gibbs, the Master Electrician.

This is an atom: 
The attenuated cable, which continually stretched itself out behind the little vessel, was
of the most recent and improved pattern for deep-sea cables.  The conducting wires in the centre
of it were scarcely thicker than hairs, while the wires forming the surrounding envelope, although
they were so small as to make the whole cable not more than an eighth of an inch in diameter,
were far stronger than the thick submarine cables which were used in the early days of ocean
telegraphy.  These outer wires were made of the Swedish toughened steel fibre, and in 1939,
with one of them a little over a sixteenth of an inch in diameter, a freight-ship of eleven
thousand tons had been towed through the Great New Jersey Canal, which had then just been opened,
and which connected Philadelphia with the ocean.

This is an atom: 
But notwithstanding his faith in the strength of the cable, Mr. Gibbs felt more and more, the
farther he progressed from the habitable world, the importance of preserving it from accident.
He had gone so far that it would be a grievous thing to be obliged to turn back.

This is an atom: 
The Dipsey sailed at a much lower depth than when she had first started upon her submarine
way.  After they had become accustomed to the feeling of being surrounded by water, her inmates
seemed to feel a greater sense of security when they were well down below all possible disturbing
influence.  When they looked forward in the line of the search-light, or through any of the
windows in various parts of the vessel, they never saw anything but water--no fish, nothing
floating.  They were too far below the ice above them to see it, and too far from what might
be on either side of them to catch a glimpse of it.  The bottom was deep below them, and it
was as though they were moving through an aqueous atmosphere.

This is an atom: 
They were comfortable, and beginning to be accustomed to their surrounding circumstances. 
The air came in regularly and steadily through the electric gills, and when deteriorated air
had collected in the expiration-chamber in the upper part of the vessel, it was forced out
by a great piston, which sent it by a hundred little valves into the surrounding water.  Thus
the pure air came in and the refuse air went out just as if the little Dipsey had been healthfully
breathing as it pushed its way through the depths.

This is an atom: 
Mrs. Block was gaining flesh.  The narrow accommodations, the everlasting electric light, the
sameness of food, and a total absence of incident had become quite natural to her, and she
had ceased to depend upon the companionship of the dust-brush and the almanac to carry her
mind back to what she considered the real things of life.

This is an atom: 
Sarah had something better now to take her mind back to Sardis and the people and things on
dry land.  The engagement and probably early marriage of Mr. Clewe and Mrs. Raleigh had made
a great impression upon her, and there were days when she never thought of the pole, so busy
was she in making plans based upon the future connection of the life of herself and Sammy and
that of Mr. and Mrs. Clewe.

This is an atom: 
Sammy and his wife had very good quarters within the boundaries of the works, but Sarah had
never been quite satisfied with them, and when the new household of Clewe should be set up,
and all the new domestic arrangements should be made, she hoped for better things.  Mr. Clewe's
little cottage would then be vacant, for of course he and his wife would not live in such a
place as that, and she thought that she and Sammy should have it.  Hour by hour and day by
day she planned the furnishing, the fitting, and the management of this cottage.

This is an atom: 
She was determined to have a servant, a woman thoroughly capable of doing general house-work;
and then there were times when she believed that if Sammy should succeed in finding the pole
his salary would be increased, and they might be able to afford two servants.  Over and over
again did she consider the question whether, in this latter case, these women should both be
general house-work servants, or one of them a cook and the other a chamber-maid and laundress.
There was much to be considered on each side.  In the latter case more efficient work could
be obtained; but in the former, in case one of them should suddenly leave, or go away for a
day out, the other could do all the work. It was very pleasant to Mrs. Block to sit in a comfortable
arm-chair and gaze thus into the future.  Sometimes she looked up into the water above, and
sometimes out into the water ahead, but she could see nothing.  But in the alluring expanse
of her fancied future she could see anything which she chose to put there.

This is an atom: 
Sammy, however, did not increase in flesh; in fact, he grew thinner.  Nothing important in
regard to the Pole, Rovinski, had occurred, but of course something would occur; otherwise
why did the Pole come on board the Dipsey?  Endless conjectures as to what Rovinski would do
when he did anything, and when he would begin to do it, kept the good Samuel awake during many
hours when he should have been soundly sleeping.  He had said nothing yet to Mr. Gibbs in regard
to the matter.  Every day he made a report to Roland Clewe about Rovinski, but Clewe's instructions
were that so long as the Pole behaved himself properly there was no reason to trouble the minds
of the party on board with fears of rascality on his part.  They had enough to occupy their
minds without any disturbing influence of that sort.

This is an atom: 
Clewe's own opinion on the subject was that Rovinski could do nothing but act as a spy, and
afterwards make dishonest use of the knowledge he should acquire; but the man had put himself
into Clewe's power, and he could not possibly get away from him until he should return to Cape
Tariff, and even there it would be difficult.  The proper and only thing to do was to keep
him in custody as long as possible.  When he should be brought back to a region of law and
justice, it might be that the Pole could be prevented, for a time, at least, from using the
results of his knavish observations.

This is an atom: 
There was another person on board whose mind was disturbed by Rovinski.  This was Mr. Marcy,
the Assistant Engineer, an active, energetic fellow, filled with ambition and love of adventure,
and one of the most hopeful and cheerful persons on board.  He had never heard of Rovinski,
and did not know that there was anybody in the world who was trying to benefit himself by fraudulent
knowledge of Mr. Clewe's discoveries and inventions, but he hated the Pole on his own account.

This is an atom: 
The man's countenance was so villainous that it was enough of itself to arouse the dislike
of a healthy-minded young fellow such as Marcy; but, moreover, the Pole had habits of sneaking
about the vessel, and afterwards retiring to quiet corners, where he would scribble in a pocket
notebook.  Such conduct as this in a man whose position corresponded with that of a common
seaman on an ordinary vessel, seemed contrary to discipline and good conduct, and he mentioned
the matter to Mr. Gibbs.

This is an atom: 
"I suppose the man is writing a letter to his wife," said the latter.  "You would not want
to hinder him from doing that, would you?"

This is an atom: 
And to this no good answer could be made.

This is an atom: 
The Pole never took notes when Sammy was anywhere where he could see him, and if Mr. Marcy
had reported this conduct to the old man, it is likely that Rovinski would speedily have been
deprived of pencils and paper, and his real character made known to the officers.

This is an atom: 
One day it was observed by those who looked out of the window in the upper deck that the water
above them was clearer than they usually saw it, and when the electric lights in the room immediately
under the window were turned out it was almost possible to discern objects in the room.  Instantly
there was a great stir on board the Dipsey, and observations soon disclosed the fact that there
was nothing above the vessel but water and air.

This is an atom: 
At first, like an electric flash, the thought ran through the vessel that they had reached
the open sea which is supposed to surround the pole, but reflection soon showed those who were
cool enough to reflect that if this were the case that sea must be much larger than they had
supposed, for they were still a long way from the pole.  Upon one thing, however, everybody
was agreed: they must ascend without loss of time to the surface of the water above them.

This is an atom: 
Up went the Dipsey, and it was not long before the great glass in the upper deck admitted pure
light from the outer world.  Then the vessel rose boldly and floated upon the surface of the
open sea.

This is an atom: 
The hatchways were thrown open, and in a few moments nearly everybody on board stood upon the
upper deck, breathing the outer air and gazing about them in the pure sunlight.  The deck was
almost flat, and surrounded by a rail.  The flooring was wet, and somewhat slippery, but nobody
thought of that; they thought of nothing but the wonderful place in which they found themselves.

This is an atom: 
They were in a small lake surrounded by lofty and precipitous icebergs.  On every side these
glittering crags rose high into the air; nowhere was there a break or an opening.  They seemed
to be in a great icy prison.  It might be supposed that it would be exhilarating to a party
who had long been submerged beneath the sea to stand once more in the open air and in the light
of day; but this was not the case.  The air they breathed was sharp and cold, and cut into
throats and lungs now accustomed to the softer air within their vessel.  Scarcely any of them,
hurrying out of the warm cabins, had thought of the necessity of heavy wraps, and the bitter
cold of the outer air perceptibly chilled their blood. Involuntarily, even while they were
staring about them, they hurried up and down the deck to keep themselves warm.

This is an atom: 
The officers puzzled their brains over the peculiar formation of this ice-encompassed lake.
It seemed as if a great ice mountain had sunk down from the midst of its companions, and had
left this awful hole.  This, however, was impossible.  No law of nature would account for such
a disappearance of an ice mountain.  Mr. Gibbs thought, under some peculiar circumstances,
a mass of ice might have broken away and floated from its surroundings, and that afterwards,
increased in size, it had floated back again, and, too large to re-enter the opening it had
made, had closed up the frozen walls of this lonely lake, accessible only to those who should
rise up into it from the sea.  Suddenly Mrs. Block stopped.

This is an atom: 
"What is that?" she cried, pointing to a spot in the icy wall which was nearest to the vessel.
Instantly every eye was turned that way.  They saw a very distinct, irregular blotch, surrounded
by almost transparent ice.

This is an atom: 
Several glasses were now levelled upon this spot, and it was discovered to be the body of a
polar bear, lying naturally upon its side, as if asleep, and entirely incased in ice.

This is an atom: 
"It must have lain down to die, on the surface of the ice," said Mr. Gibbs, "and gradually
the ice has formed above it, until it now rests in that vast funeral casket."

This is an atom: 
"How long since he laid down there to die, Mr. Gibbs?" asked Sarah, as she took the glass from
her eye.  "He looks as natural as if he was asleep."

This is an atom: 
"I cannot say," he answered.  "It may have been hundreds, even thousands, of years ago."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, horrible!" said Sarah.  "All that makes me shiver, and I am sure I don't need anything
to make me do that.  I wish we would go down, Sammy; I would like to get out of this awful
place, with those dreadful glitterin' walls that nobody could get up or over, and things lyin'
frozen for a thousand years; and, besides, it's so cold!"

This is an atom: 
It seemed as if Sarah's words had struck the key-note to the feelings of the whole company.
In the heart of every one arose a strong desire to sink out of this cold, bleak, terrifying
open air into the comfortable motherly arms of the encircling waters. For a few minutes Captain
Jim Hubbell had experienced a sense of satisfaction at finding himself once more upon the deck
of a vessel floating upon the open sea.  He felt that he was in his element, and that the time
had come for him to assume his proper position as a sailor; but this feeling soon passed, and
he declared that his spine was like a long icicle.

This is an atom: 
"Don't you think we had better go down again?" said Sammy.  "I think we have all seen enough
of this, and it isn't anything that any use can be made of."

This is an atom: 
"You are right," said Mr. Gibbs; "let everybody go below."

This is an atom: 
But it was not easy for everybody to obey this command.  The wet decks were now covered with
a thin surface of ice, and those who had been standing still for a few moments found it difficult
to release their shoes from the flooring of the deck, while several of the men slipped down
as they made their way to the forward hatch.  As for Sarah Block, she found it impossible to
move at all.  Her shoes were of a peculiar kind, the soles being formed of thick felt, and
these, having been soaked with water, had frozen firmly to the deck.  She tried to make a step
and almost fell over.

This is an atom: 
"Heavens and earth!" she screamed; "don't let this boat go down and leave me standing outside!"

This is an atom: 
Her husband and two men tried to release her, but they could not disengage her shoes from the
deck; so Sammy was obliged to loosen her shoe-strings, and then he and another man lifted her
out of her shoes and carried her to the hatchway, whence she very speedily hurried below.

This is an atom: 
Everybody was now inside the vessel, the hatches were tightly closed, and the Dipsey began
to sink.  When she had descended to the comparatively temperate depths of the sea, and her
people found themselves in her warm and well-lighted compartments, there was a general disposition
to go about and shake hands with each other.  Some of them even sang little snatches of songs,
so relieved were they to get down out of that horrible upper air.

This is an atom: 
"Of course I shall never see my shoes again," said Mrs. Block; "and they were mighty comfortable
ones, too.  I suppose, when they have been down here awhile in this water, which must be almost
lukewarmish compared to what it is on top, they will melt loose and float up; and then, Sammy,
suppose they lodge on some of that ice and get frozen for a thousand years!  Good gracious!
It sets me all of a creep to think of that happenin' to my shoes, that I have been wearin'
every day!  Don't you want a cup of tea?"

This is an atom: 
"It's a great pity," thought Sammy to himself, "that it wasn't that Pole that had his feet
frozen to the deck.  The rest of us might have been lucky enough not to have noticed him as
the boat went down."

This is an atom: 
"We ought to get a name for that body of water up there," said Mr. Gibbs, as he was writing
out his report of the day's adventures.  "Shall we call it 'Lake Clewe'?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, don't do that!" exclaimed Sammy Block.  "Mr. Clewe's too good a man to have his name tacked
on to that hole.  If you want to name it, why don't you call it 'Lake Shiver'?"

This is an atom: 
"That is a good name," answered Mr. Gibbs; and so it was called.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XI

This is an atom: 
THEY BELIEVE IT IS THE POLAR SEA

This is an atom: 
With no intention of ascending again into any accidental holes in the ice above them, the voyagers
on the Dipsey kept on their uneventful way, until, upon the third day after their discovery
of the lake, the electric bell attached to the heavy lead which always hung suspended below
the vessel, rang violently, indicating that it had touched the bottom.  This sound startled
everybody on board.  In all their submarine experiences they had not yet sunk down low enough
to be anywhere near the bottom of the sea.

This is an atom: 
Of course orders were given to ascend immediately, and at the same time a minor search-light
was directed upward through the deck skylight.  To the horror of the observers, ice could plainly
be seen stretching above them like an irregular, gray sky.

This is an atom: 
Here was a condition of things which had not been anticipated. The bottom below and the ice
above were approaching each other. Of course it might have been some promontory of the rocks
under the sea against which their telltale lead had struck; but there was an instrument on
board for taking soundings by means of a lead suspended outside and a wire running through
a water-proof hole in the bottom of the vessel, and when the Dipsey had risen a few fathoms,
and was progressing very slowly, this instrument was used at frequent intervals, and it was
found that the electric lead had not touched a rock projecting upward, and that the bottom
was almost level.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Gibbs's instrument gave him an approximate idea of the vessel's depth in the water, and
the dial connected with the sounding apparatus told him hour by hour that the distance from
the bottom, as the vessel kept forward on the same plane, was becoming less and less.  Consequently
he determined, so long as he was able to proceed, to keep the Dipsey as near as possible at
a median distance between the ice and the bottom.

This is an atom: 
This was an anxious time.  So long as they had felt that they had plenty of sea-room the little
party of adventurers had not yet recognized any danger which they thought sufficient to deter
them from farther progress; but if the ice and the bottom were coming together, what could
they do?  It was possible, by means of explosives they carried, to shatter the ice above them;
but action of this kind had not been contemplated unless they should find themselves at the
pole and still shut in by ice.  They did not wish to get out into the open air at the point
where they found themselves; and, moreover, it would not have been safe to explode their great
bombs in such shallow water.  A consultation was held, and it was agreed that the best thing
to do was to diverge from the course they had steadily maintained, and try to find a deeper
channel leading to the north.  Accordingly they steered eastward.

This is an atom: 
It was not long before they found that they had judged wisely; the bottom descended far out
of the reach of their electric lead, and they were enabled to keep a safe distance below the
overhanging ice.

This is an atom: 
"I feel sure," said Mr. Gibbs, "that we came near running against some outreaching portion
of the main Western Continent, and now we have got to look out for the foundations of Greenland's
icy mountains."  He spoke cheerily, for he wished to encourage his companions, but there was
a very anxious look upon his face when he was not speaking to any one.

This is an atom: 
The next day every one was anxious, whether he spoke or was silent.  The bottom was rising
again, and the Dipsey was obliged to sail nearer and nearer to the ice above.  Between two
dangers, constricted and trammelled as they were, none of them could help feeling the terrors
of their position, and if it had not been for the encouraging messages which continually came
to them from Sardis, they might not have been able to keep up brave hearts.

This is an atom: 
After two days of most cautious progress, during which the water became steadily shallower
and shallower, it was discovered that the ice above, which they were now obliged to approach
much more closely than they had ever done before, was comparatively thin, and broken in many
places.  Great cracks could be seen in it here and there, and movements could be discerned
indicating that it was a floe, or floating mass of ice.  If that were the case, it was not
impossible that they were now nearing the edge of the ice under which they had so long been
sailing, and that beyond them was the open water.  If they could reach that, and find it the
unobstructed sea which was supposed to exist at this end of the earth's axis, their expedition
was a success.  At that moment they were less than one hundred miles from the pole.

This is an atom: 
Whether the voyagers on the Dipsey were more excited when the probable condition of their situation
became known to them, or whether Roland Clewe and Margaret Raleigh in the office of the Works
at Sardis were the more greatly moved when they received that day's report from the arctic
regions, it would be hard to say.  If there should be room enough for the little submarine
vessel to safely navigate beneath the ice which there was such good reason to believe was floating
on the edge of the body of water they had come in search of, and on whose surface they might
freely sail, what then was likely to hinder them from reaching the pole?  The presence of ice
in the vicinity of that extreme northern point was feared by no one concerned in the expedition,
for it was believed that the rotary motion of the earth would have a tendency to drive it away
from the pole by centrifugal force.

This is an atom: 
The little thermometer-boat which during the submarine voyage of the Dipsey had constantly
preceded her to give warning of the sunken base of some great iceberg, was now drawn in close
to the bow; there was so much ice so near that its warnings were constant, and therefore unneeded.

This is an atom: 
The electric lead-line was shortened to the length of a few fathoms, and even then it sometimes
suddenly rang out its alarm. After a time the bottom of the sea became visible through the
stout glass of a protected window near the bow, and a man was placed there to report what he
could see below them.

This is an atom: 
It had now become so light that in some parts of the vessel the electric lamps were turned
out.  Fissures of considerable size appeared in the ice above, and then, to the great excitement
of every one, the vessel slowly moved under a wide space of open water; but the ice could be
seen ahead, and she did not rise. The bottom came no nearer, and the Dipsey moved cautiously
on. Nobody thought of eating; they did not talk much, but at every one of the outlooks there
were eager faces.

This is an atom: 
At last they saw nothing above them but floating fragments of ice.  Still they kept on, until
they were plainly moving below the surface of open water.  Then Mr. Gibbs looked at Sammy.

This is an atom: 
"I think it is time to rise," said he; and Sammy passed the word that the Dipsey was going
up into the upper air.

This is an atom: 
When the little craft, so long submerged in the quiet depths of the Arctic Sea, had risen until
she rested on the surface of the water, there was no general desire, as there had been when
she emerged into Lake Shiver, to rush upon the upper deck.  Instead of that, the occupants
gathered together and looked at each other in a hesitating way, as if they were afraid to go
out and see whether they were really in an open sea, or lying in some small ice-locked body
of water.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Gibbs was very pale.

This is an atom: 
"My friends," said he, "we are going on deck to find out whether or not we have reached the
open polar sea, but we must not be excited, and we must not jump to hurried conclusions; we
may have found what we are in search of, and we may not have found it yet. But we will go up
and look out upon the polar world as far as we can see it, and we shall not decide upon this
thing or that until we have thoroughly studied the whole situation.  The engines are stopped,
and every one may go up, but I advise you all to put on your warmest clothes.  We should remember
our experience at Lake Shiver."

This is an atom: 
"It wouldn't be a bad idea," said Sammy Block, "to throw out a lot of tarpaulins to stand on,
so that none of us will get frozen to the wet deck, as happened before."

This is an atom: 
When the hatch was opened a man with a black beard pushed himself forward towards the companionway.

This is an atom: 
"Keep back here, sir," said Mr. Marcy, clapping his hand upon the man's shoulder.

This is an atom: 
"I want to be ready to spread the tarpaulins, sir," said he, with a wriggling motion, as if
he would free himself.

This is an atom: 
"You want to be the first to see the polar sea, that is my opinion," said Mr. Marcy; "but you
keep back there where you belong."  And with that he gave the eager Rovinski a staggering push
to the rear.

This is an atom: 
Five minutes afterwards Margaret Raleigh and Roland Clewe, sitting close together by the telegraph
instrument in the Works at Sardis, received the following message:

This is an atom: 
"We have risen to the surface of what we believe to be the open polar sea.  Everybody is on
deck but me.  It is very cold, and a wind is blowing.  Off to our left there are high mountains,
stretching westward as far as we can see.  They are all snow and ice, but they look blue and
green and beautiful.  From these mountains there comes this way a long cape, with a little
mountain at the end of it.  Mr. Gibbs says this mountain, which is about twenty miles away,
must be just about between us and the pole, but it does not cut us off.  Far out to the right,
as far as we can see, there is open water shining in the sun, so that we can sail around the
cape.  On the right and behind us, southward, are everlasting plains of snow and ice, which
we have just come from under.  They are so white that it dazzles our eyes to look at them.
In some places they are smooth, and in some places they are tumbled up.  On the very edge of
the sky, in that direction, there are more mountains.  There are no animals or people anywhere.
It is very cold, even inside the vessel.  My fingers are stiff.  Now that we are out on the
water, in regular shipshape, Captain Jim Hubbell has taken command.  We are going to cruise
northward as soon as we can get things regulated for outside sailing.

This is an atom: 
"SAMUEL BLOCK."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XII

This is an atom: 
CAPTAIN HUBBELL TAKES COMMAND

This is an atom: 
It was a high-spirited and joyous party that the Dipsey now carried; not one of them doubted
that they had emerged from under the ice into the polar sea.  To the northeast they could see
its waves shining and glistening all the way to the horizon, and they believed that beyond
the cape in front of them these waters shone and glistened to the very north.  They breathed
the polar air, which, as they became used to it, was exhilarating and enlivening, and they
basked in the sunshine, which, although it did not warm their bodies very much, cheered and
brightened their souls.  But what made them happier than anything else was the thought that
they would soon start direct for the pole, on top of the water, and with nothing in the way.

This is an atom: 
When Captain Jim Hubbell took command of the Dipsey the state of affairs on that vessel underwent
a great change.  He was sharp, exact, and severe; he appreciated the dignity of his position,
and he wished to let everybody see that he did so.  The men on board who had previously been
workmen now became sailors--at least in the eyes of Captain Hubbell.  He did not know much
about the work that they had been in the habit of doing, but he intended to teach them the
duties of sailors just as soon as he could find any such duties for them to perform.  He walked
about the deck with an important air, and looked for something about which he might give orders.
There were no masts or spars or shrouds or sheets, but there were tarpaulins on the deck, and
these were soon arranged in seamanlike fashion.  A compass was rigged up on deck, and Captain
Hubbell put himself into communication with the electric steersman.

This is an atom: 
It was morning when the Dipsey emerged from the sea, although day and night were equally bright
at that season, and at twelve o'clock Captain Hubbell took an observation, assisted by Sammy.
The result was as follows: longitude, 69  30'; latitude, 88 42'.

This is an atom: 
"It strikes me," said Captain James Hubbell, "that that latitude goes over anything ever set
down by any skipper, ancient or modern."

This is an atom: 
"I should say so," answered Sammy.  "But that record won't be anything compared to what we
are goin' to set down."

This is an atom: 
Work went on very rapidly, in order to get the Dipsey into regular nautical condition, and
although it was out of his line, Captain Hubbell made it a point to direct as much of it as
he could.  The electric gills were packed as close to the side of the vessel as possible, and
the various contrivances for heating and ventilation when sailing in the open air were put
into working order.  At four o'clock in the afternoon our party started to round the icy promontory
ahead of them, encouraged by a most hearty and soul-inspiring message from the hills of New Jersey.

This is an atom: 
"It's all very fine," said Sarah Block to her husband, "for everybody on board to be talkin'
about what a splendid thing it is to be sailin' on the surface of the sea, in the bright and
beautiful air, but I must say that I like a ship to keep quiet when I am on board of her. 
I had a pretty bad time when I was comin' up on the Go Lightly, but she was big and didn't
wabble like this little thing.  We went along beautifully when we were under the water, with
the floor just as level as if we were at home, in a house, and now I am not feelin' anything
like as well as I have been.  For my part, I think it would be a great deal better to sink
down again and go the rest of the way under the water.  I am sure we found it very comfortable,
and a great deal warmer."

This is an atom: 
Sammy laughed.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, that would not do at all," he said.  "You can't expect the people on board this vessel
to be willin' to scoop along under the water when they have got a chance of sailin' like Christians
in the open air.  It's the sudden change that troubles you, Sarah; you'll soon get over it."

This is an atom: 
But Sarah was not satisfied.  The Dipsey rolled a good deal, and the good woman was frequently
obliged to stop and steady herself when crossing the little cabin.

This is an atom: 
"I feel," said she, "as if I had had a Christmas dinner yesterday and somebody else had made
the pies."

This is an atom: 
The dissatisfied condition of Mrs. Block had a cheering influence upon Captain Hubbell when
he heard of it.

This is an atom: 
"By George!" said he, "this seems like good old times.  When I was young and there was women
on board, they all got a little sea-sick; but nowadays, with these ball-and-socket ships, you
never hear of that sort of thing.  A sea-sick woman is the most natural thing I have struck
yet on this cruise."

This is an atom: 
Mrs. Block's uneasiness, however, did not last very long.  A few electric capsules of half
an alterative volt each soon relieved her; but her mind was still out of order; she was not
satisfied. She had accustomed herself to submerged conditions, and ordinary voyaging was very
different.

This is an atom: 
"It wouldn't surprise me," she said, "if we should find that there wasn't any pole; that's
about the way these things generally turn out."

This is an atom: 
In a few hours the Dipsey had rounded the cape, keeping well off shore.  In front was a clear
sweep of unobstructed water.  With their telescopes they could see nothing on the horizon which
indicated the presence of land.  If the sea should stretch out before them, as they hoped and
expected, a sail of about seventy miles ought to bring them to the pole.  The Dipsey did not
go at full speed; there was no hurry, and as he was in absolutely unknown waters, Captain Hubbell
wished to take no risks of sunken reefs or barely submerged islands.  Soundings were frequent,
and they found that the polar sea--at least that part over which they were sailingwas a comparatively
shallow body of water.

This is an atom: 
Before they left Sardis, preparations had been made for an appropriate and permanent designation
of the exact position of the northern end of the earth's axis.  If this should be discovered
to be on solid land, there was a great iron standard, or column, on board, in detached parts,
with all appliances for setting it up firmly in the rocks or earth or ice; but if the end of
the said axis should be found to be covered by water of not too great depth, a buoy had been
provided which should be anchored upon the polar point.

This is an atom: 
This buoy was a large hollow, aluminium globe, from which a tall steel flag-post projected
upward to a considerable height, bearing a light weather-vane, which, when the buoy should
be in its intended position, would always point southward, no matter which way the wind might
blow.  This great buoy contained various appropriate articles, which had been hermetically
sealed up in it before it left Sardis, where it was manufactured.  All the documents, books,
coins, and other articles which are usually placed in the corner-stones of important buildings
were put in this, together with the names of the persons who had gone on this perilous expedition
and those who had been its projectors and promoters.  More than this, there was an appropriate
inscription deeply cut into the metal on the upper part of the buoy, with a space left for
the date of the discovery, should it ever take place.

This is an atom: 
But the mere ceremony of anchoring a buoy at the exact position of the pole was not enough
to satisfy the conscientious ambition of Mr. Gibbs.  He had come upon this perilous voyage
with the earnest intention of doing his duty in all respects, while endeavoring to make the
great discovery of the age; and if that discovery should be made, he believed that his country
should share in the glory and in the material advantage, whatever that might be, of the achievement.
Consequently it was his opinion that if the pole should be discovered, the discoverers should
take possession of it in the name of their country.  Every one on board--except Sarah Block,
who had something to say about the old proverb concerning the counting of chickens before they
are hatched--thought this a good idea, and when the plan was submitted to Mr. Clewe and Mrs.
Raleigh, they heartily approved.

This is an atom: 
Preparations were now made to take possession of the pole if they should reach it on the water.
On the after-part of the deck a ring about three feet in diameter was marked, and it was arranged
that when they had ascertained, by the most accurate observations and calculations, the exact
position of the pole, they would so guide their vessel that this ring should be as nearly as
possible directly over it.  Then one of the party should step inside of the ring and take possession
of the pole.  After this the buoy would be anchored, and their intended scientific observations
and explorations would proceed.

This is an atom: 
It was supposed both on the Dipsey and at Sardis that Mr. Gibbs would assume the honor of this
act of taking possession, but that gentleman declined to do so.  He considered that he would
no more discover the pole, if they should reach it, than would his companions; and he also
believed that, from a broad point of view, Mr. Roland Clewe was the real discoverer.  Consequently
he considered that the direct representative of the interests of Mr. Clewe should take possession,
and it was decided that Samuel Block should add the north pole to the territory of his native land.

This is an atom: 
When this had been settled, a very great change came over the mind of Sarah Block.  That her
husband should be the man to do this great thing filled her with pride and alert enthusiasm.

This is an atom: 
"Sammy," she exclaimed, "when you are doin' that, you will be the greatest man in this world,
and you will stand at the top of everything."

This is an atom: 
"Suppose there should be a feller standin' on the south pole," said Sammy, "wouldn't he have
the same right to say that he was on top of everything?"

This is an atom: 
"No," said Sarah, sharply.  "The way I look at it, the north pole is above and the south pole
is below; but there ain't any other feller down there, so we needn't talk about it.  And now,
Sammy, if you are goin' to take possession of the pole, you ought to put on your best clothes.
For one thing, you should wear a pair of those new red flannel socks that you haven't had on
yet; it will be a good way to christen 'em.  Everything on you ought to be perfectly fresh
and clean, and just as nice as you've got.  This will be the first time that anybody ever took
possession of a pole, and you ought to look your very best.  I would ask you to shave, because
you would look better that way, but I suppose if you took off your beard you would take cold
in your jaws.  And I want you to stand up straight, and talk as long about it as you can. 
You are too much given to cuttin' off ceremonies mighty short, as I remember was the case when
you were statin' your 'pinions about our weddin'; but I had my way then, and I want to have
it now.  You are goin' to be a big man, Sammy, and your name will go all over the world, so
you must screw yourself up to as much eminence as you think you can stand."

This is an atom: 
Sammy laughed.  "Well, I will do what I can," said he; "that is, providin' our chickens are
hatched."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, they'll come out all right," said Sarah.  "I haven't the least doubt of it, now that you
are to be the chief figure in the hatchin'."

This is an atom: 
Shortly after the ordinary hour for rising, an order was issued by Captain Hubbell, and enforced
by Samuel Block, that no one should be allowed to come on deck who had not eaten breakfast.
There were those on board that vessel who would have stayed on deck during all the hours which
should have been devoted to sleeping, had it not been so cold.  There would probably be nothing
to see when they reached the pole, but they wanted to be on hand, that they might see for themselves
that there was nothing to see.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XIII

This is an atom: 
LONGITUDE EVERYTHING

This is an atom: 
The sun was as high in the polar heavens as it ever rises in that part of the world.  Captain
Hubbell stood on the deck of the Dipsey.  with his quadrant in hand to take an observation.
The engines had been stopped, and nearly everybody on the vessel now surrounded him.

This is an atom: 
"Longitude everything," said Captain James Hubbell, "latitude ninety, which is as near as I
can make it out."

This is an atom: 
"My friends," said Mr. Gibbs, looking about him, "we have found the pole."

This is an atom: 
And at these words every head was uncovered.

This is an atom: 
For some moments no one spoke; but there was a look upon the faces of most of the party which
expressed a feeling which was voiced by Sarah Block.

This is an atom: 
"And yet," said she, speaking in a low tone, "there's nothing to see, after all!"

This is an atom: 
Captain Hubbell's observations and calculations, although accurate enough for all ordinary
nautical purposes, were not sufficiently precise to satisfy the demands of the present occasion,
and Mr. Gibbs and the electricians began a series of experiments to determine the exact position
of the true pole.

This is an atom: 
The vessel was now steered this way and that, sometimes backed, and then sent forward again.
After about an hour of this zigzag work Mr. Gibbs ordered the engine stopped.

This is an atom: 
"Now," said he, "the ring on the deck is exactly over the pole, and we may prepare to take
possession."

This is an atom: 
At these words Samuel Block disappeared below, followed by his wife.

This is an atom: 
"That was an odd expression of yours, Captain Hubbell," said Mr. Gibbs, "when you said we had
reached longitude everything.  It is correct, of course, but it had not struck me in that light."

This is an atom: 
"Of course it is correct," said Captain Hubbell.  "The end of every line of longitude is right
here in a bunch.  If you were a bird, you could choose one of 'em and fly down along it to
Washington or Greenwich or any other point you pleased. Longitude everything is what it is;
we've got the whole of 'em right under us."

This is an atom: 
Now Samuel Block came on deck, where everybody else on board soon gathered.  With a furled
flag in his hand, dressed in his best and cleanest clothes, and with a large fur cloak thrown
over his shoulders, Mr Block advanced towards the ring on the deck, near the compass.

This is an atom: 
But he was yet several yards from this point when a black figure, crouching close to the deck,
issued from among the men, a little in the rear of the party, and made a dash towards the ring.
It was the Pole, Rovinski, who had been standing quivering with excitement, waiting for this
supreme moment.  But almost at the same instant there sprang from the side of Mr. Gibbs another
figure, with a face livid with agitation.  This was Mr. Marcy, who had noticed the foreigner's
excitement and had been watching him.  Like a stone from a catapult, Mr. Marcy rushed towards
Rovinski, taking a course diagonal to that of the latter, and, striking him with tremendous
force just before he reached the ring, he threw him against the rail with such violence that
the momentum given to his head and body carried them completely over it, and his legs following,
the man went headlong into the sea.

This is an atom: 
Instantly there was a shout of horror.  Sarah Block screamed violently, and her husband exclaimed:
"That infernal Pole!  He has gone down to the pole, and I hope he may stay there!"

This is an atom: 
"What does all this mean, Mr. Marcy?" roared Captain Hubbell; "and why did you throw him overboard?"

This is an atom: 
"Never mind now," cried Sammy, his voice rising above the confusion.  "I will tell you all
about it.  I see what he was up to.  He wanted to take possession of the pole in his own beastly
name, most likely."

This is an atom: 
"I don't understand a word of all this," exclaimed Mr. Gibbs. "But there is the man; he has
risen to the surface."

This is an atom: 
"Shall we let him sink," cried Sammy, "or haul him aboard?"

This is an atom: 
"Let the man sink!" yelled Captain Hubbell.  "What do you mean, sir?"

This is an atom: 
"Well, I suppose it wouldn't do," said Sammy, "and we must get him aboard."

This is an atom: 
Captain Hubbell roared out orders to throw out life-preservers and lower a boat; but, remembering
that he was not on board a vessel of the olden times, he changed the order and commanded that
a patent boat-hook be used upon the man in the water.

This is an atom: 
The end of this boat-hook, which could be shot out like a fishing-rod, was hooked into Rovinski's
clothes, and he was pulled to the vessel.  Then a rope was lowered, and he was hauled on board,
shivering and shaking.

This is an atom: 
"Take him below and put him in irons," cried Sammy.

This is an atom: 
"Mr. Block," said Captain Hubbell, "I want you to understand that I am skipper of this vessel,
and that I am to give orders.  I don't know anything about this man; but do you want him put
in irons?"

This is an atom: 
"I do," said Sammy, "for the present."

This is an atom: 
"Take that man below and put him in irons!" roared Captain Hubbell.

This is an atom: 
"And give him some dry clothes," added Sarah Block.

This is an atom: 
When the confusion consequent upon the incident had subsided there was a general desire not
to delay for a moment the actual act of taking legal possession of the pole they had discovered.

This is an atom: 
Sammy now advanced, his fur cap in one hand and his flag in the other, and took his position
in the centre of the circle.  For a few moments he did not speak, but turned slowly around,
as if desirous of availing himself of the hitherto unknown privilege of looking southward in
every direction.

This is an atom: 
"I'm glad he remembers what I told him," said Sarah.  "He's making it last as long as he can."

This is an atom: 
"As the representative of Roland Clewe, Esq.," said Samuel, deliberately and distinctly, "I
take possession of the north pole of this earth in the name of United North America." With
these words he unfurled his flag, with its broad red and white stripes, and its seven great
stars in the field of blue, and stuck the sharp end of the flagstaff into the deck in the centre
of the circle.*

This is an atom: 
[* It must be understood that at this time the seven great countries of North America--Greenland,
Norland (formerly British America, British Columbia, and Alaska), Canada, the United States,
Mexico, Central America, and West Indies--were united under one confederated government, and
had one flag, a modification of the banner of the dominant nation.]

This is an atom: 
"Now," said he to his companions, "this pole is ours, and if anybody ever comes into this sea
from Russia, or Iceland, or any other place, they will find the north pole has been pre-empted."
At this three hearty cheers were given by the assembled company, who thereupon put on their hats.

This is an atom: 
The rest of that day and part of the next were spent in taking soundings, and very curious
and surprising results were obtained. The electric lead, which rang the instant it touched
bottom, showed that the sea immediately over the pole was comparatively shallow, while in every
direction from this point the depth increased rapidly.  Many interesting experiments were made,
which determined the character of the bottom and the varied deposits thereupon, but the most
important result of the work of Mr. Gibbs and his associates was the discovery of the formation
of the extreme northern portion of the earth.  The rock-bed of the sea was found to be of the
shape of a flattened cone, regularly sloping off from the polar point.

This is an atom: 
This peculiar form of the solid portion of the earth at the pole was occasioned, Mr. Gibbs
believed, by the rotary motion of the bottom of the sea, which moved much more rapidly than
the water above it, thus gradually wearing itself away, and giving to our earth that depression
at the poles which has been so long known to geographers.

This is an atom: 
Day after day the experiments went on; but Mr. Gibbs and his associates were extremely interested
in what they were doing; some of the rest of the party began to get a little tired of the monotony.
There was absolutely nothing to see except water and sky; and although the temperature was
frequently some degrees above freezing, and became sometimes quite pleasant as they gradually
grew accustomed to the outer arctic atmosphere, those who had no particular occupation to divert
their minds made frequent complaints of the cold.  There were occasional snow-storms, but these
did not last long, and as a rule the skies were clear.

This is an atom: 
"But think, Sarah," said Samuel Block, in answer to some of her complaints, "what it would
be if this were winter, and, instead of being light all the time, it was dark, with the mercury
'way down at the bottom of the thermometer!"

This is an atom: 
"I don't intend to think of it at all," replied Sarah, sharply. "Do you suppose I am goin'
to consent to stay here until the everlastin' night comes on?  If that happened, I would simply
stretch myself out and die.  It's bad enough as it is; but when I look out on the sun, and
think that it is the same sun that is shinin' on Sardis, and on the house which I hope we are
goin' to have when we get back, I feel as if there was somethin' up here besides you, Sammy,
that I'm accustomed to.  If it was not for you and the sun, I could not get along at all; but
if the sun's gone, I don't think you will be enough.  I wish they would plant that corner-stone
buoy and let us be off."

This is an atom: 
But by far the most dissatisfied person on board was the Pole, Rovinski.  He was chained to
the floor in the hold, and could see nothing; nor could he find out anything.  Sammy had explained
his character and probable intentions to Captain Hubbell, who had thereupon delivered to Mr.
Block a very severe lecture for not telling him before.

This is an atom: 
"If I've got a scoundrel on board I want to know it, and I hope this sort of thing won't happen
again, Mr. Block."

This is an atom: 
"I don't see how it can," answered Sammy; "and I must admit I ought to have told you as soon
as you took command; but people don't always do all they ought to do; and, as for tellin' Mr.
Gibbs, I would not do that, for his mind is rigged on a hair-spring balance anyway; it wouldn't
do to upset him."

This is an atom: 
"And what are we goin' to do with the feller?" said the captain. "Now that I know what this
Pole is, I wish I had let him go down to the other pole and stay there."

This is an atom: 
"I thought so at first," said Sammy; "but I'm glad he didn't; I'd hate to think of our glorious
pole with that thing floppin' on it."

This is an atom: 
At last all was ready to anchor the great buoy, and preparations were in progress for this
important event, when everybody was startled by a shout from Mr. Marcy.

This is an atom: 
"Hello!" he cried.  "What's that?  A sail?"

This is an atom: 
"Where away?" shouted the captain.

This is an atom: 
"To the south," replied Mr. Marcy.  And instantly everybody was looking in opposite directions.
But Mr. Marcy's outstretched arm soon indicated to all the position of the cause of his outcry.
It was a black spot clearly visible upon the surface of the sea, and apparently about two miles
away.  Quickly Captain Hubbell had his glass directed upon it, and the next moment he gave
a loud cry.

This is an atom: 
"It's a whale!" he shouted.  "There's whales in this polar sea!"

This is an atom: 
"I thought you said whales were extinct," cried Sammy.

This is an atom: 
"So I did," replied the captain.  "And so they are in all Christian waters.  Who ever could
have imagined that we would have found 'em here?"

This is an atom: 
Sarah Block was so frightened when she found there was a whale in the same water in which the
Dipsey floated that she immediately hurried below, with an indistinct idea of putting on her
things. In such a case as this, it was time for her to leave.  But soon recognizing the state
of affairs, she sat down in a chair, threw a shawl over her head, and waited for the awful bump.

This is an atom: 
"Fortunately whales are soft," she said to her, self over and over again.

This is an atom: 
No one now thought of buoys.  Every eye on deck was fixed upon the exposed back of the whale,
and everybody speedily agreed that it was coming nearer to them.  It did come nearer and nearer,
and at one time it raised its head as if it were endeavoring to look over the water at the
strange object which had come into those seas.  Then suddenly it tossed its tail high into
the air and sank out of sight.

This is an atom: 
"It's a right-whale!" cried Captain Hubbell.  "There's whales in this sea!  Let's get through
this buoy business and go cruisin' after 'em."

This is an atom: 
There was a great deal of excited talk about the appearance of the whale, but this was not
allowed to interfere with the business in hand.  A chain, not very heavy but of enormous strength,
and of sufficient length to reach the bottom and give plenty of play, was attached to an anchor
of a peculiar kind.  It was very large and heavy, made of iron, and shaped something like a
cuttlefish, with many arms which would cling to the bottom if any force were exerted to move
the anchor.  The other end of the chain was attached to the lower part of the buoy, and with
powerful cranes the anchor was hoisted on deck, and when everything had been made ready the
buoy, which had had the proper date cut upon it, was lowered into the water.  Then the great
anchor was dropped into the sea, as nearly as possible over the pole.

This is an atom: 
The sudden rush downward of the anchor and the chain caused the buoy to dip into the sea as
if it were about to sink out of sight, but in a few moments it rose again, and the great sphere,
half-way out of the water, floated proudly upon the surface of the polar sea.

This is an atom: 
Then came a great cheer, and Mrs. Block--who, having been assured that the whale had entirely
disappeared, had come on deck--turned to her husband and remarked: "Now, Sammy, is there any
earthly reason why we should not turn right around and go straight home? The pole's found,
and the place is marked, and what more is there for us to do?"

This is an atom: 
But before her husband could answer her, Captain Hubbell lifted up his voice, which was full
of spirit and enthusiasm.

This is an atom: 
"Messmates!" he cried, "we have touched at the pole, and we have anchored the buoy, and now
let us go whalin'.  It's thirty years since I saw one of them fish, and I never expected in
all my born days I'd go a-whalin'."

This is an atom: 
The rest of the company on the Dipsey took no very great interest in the whaling cruise, but,
on consultation with Mr. Clewe and Mrs. Raleigh at Sardis, it was decided that they ought by
no means to leave the polar sea until they had explored it as thoroughly as circumstances would
allow.  Consequently the next day the Dipsey sailed away from the pole, leaving the buoy brightly
floating on a gently rolling sea, its high-uplifted weather-vane glittering in the sun, with
each of its ends always pointing bravely to the south.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XIV

This is an atom: 
A REGION OF NOTHINGNESS

This is an atom: 
In the office of the Works at Sardis, side by side at the table on which stood the telegraph
instrument, Margaret Raleigh and Roland Clewe, receiving the daily reports from the Dipsey,
had found themselves in such sympathy and harmony with the party they had sent out on this
expedition that they too, in fancy, had slowly groped their way under the grim overhanging
ice out into the open polar sea.  They too had stood on the deck of the vessel which had risen
like a spectre out of the waters, and in the cold, clear atmosphere had gazed about them at
this hitherto unknown part of the world.  They had thrilled with enthusiastic excitement when
the ring on the deck of the Dipsey was placed over the actual location of the pole; they had
been filled with anger when they heard of the conduct of Rovinski; and their souls had swelled
with a noble love of country and pride in their own achievements when they heard that they,
by their representative, had made the north pole a part of their native land.  They had listened,
scarcely breathing, to the stirring account of the anchoring of the great buoy to one end of
the earth's axis, and they had exclaimed in amazement at the announcement that in the lonely
waters of the pole whales were still to be found, when they were totally unknown in every other
portion of the earth.

This is an atom: 
But now the stirring events in the arctic regions which had so held and enthralled them day
by day had, after a time, ceased. Mr. Gibbs was engaged in making experiments, observations,
and explorations, the result of which he would embody in carefully prepared reports, and Sammy's
daily message promised to be rather monotonous.  Roland Clewe felt the great importance of
a thorough exploration and examination of the polar sea.  The vessel he had sent out had reached
this hitherto inaccessible region, but it was not at all certain that another voyage, even
of the same kind, would be successful.  Consequently he advised those in charge of the expedition
not to attempt to return until the results of their work were as complete as possible.  Should
the arctic night overtake them before they left the polar sea, this would not interfere with
their return in the same manner in which they had gone north, for in a submarine voyage artificial
light would be necessary at any season.  So, for a tune, Roland and Margaret withdrew in a
great measure their thoughts from the vicinity of the pole, and devoted themselves to their
work at home.

This is an atom: 
When Roland Clewe had penetrated with his Artesian ray as deeply into the earth beneath him
as the photic power of his instrument would admit, he had applied all the available force of
his establishment--the men working in relays day and night--to the manufacture of the instruments
which should give increased power to the penetrating light, which he hoped would make visible
to him the interior structure of the earth, up to this time as unknown to man as had been the
regions of the poles.

This is an atom: 
Roland had devoted a great deal of time to the arrangement of a system of reflectors, by which
he hoped to make it possible to look down into the cylinder of light produced by the Artesian
ray without projecting any portion of the body of the observer into the ray.  This had been
done principally to provide against the possibility of a shock to Margaret, such as he received
when he beheld a man with the upper part of his body totally invisible, and a section of the
other portion laid bare to the eye of a person standing in front of it.  But his success had
not been satisfactory.  It was quite different to look directly down into that magical perforation
at his feet, instead of studying the reflection of the same, indistinctly and uncertainly revealed
by a system of mirrors.

This is an atom: 
Consequently the plan of reflectors was discarded, and Roland determined that the right thing
to do was to take Margaret into his confidence and explain to her why he and she should not
stand together and look down the course of the Artesian ray.  She scolded him for not telling
her all this before, and a permanent screen was erected around the spot on which the ray was
intended to work, formed of Venetian blinds with fixed slats, so that the person inside could
readily talk and consult with others outside without being seen by them.

This is an atom: 
As might well be supposed, this work with the "photic borer," as Clewe now called his instrument,
was of absorbing interest.  For a day or two after it was again put into operation Margaret
and Roland could scarcely tear themselves away from it long enough for necessary sleep and
meals, and several persons connected with the Works were frequently permitted to witness its
wonderful operations.

This is an atom: 
Down, down descended that cylinder of light, until it had passed through all the known geological
strata in that part of New Jersey, and had reached subterranean depths known to Clewe only
by comparison and theory.

This is an atom: 
The apparent excavation had extended itself down so far that the disk at the bottom, although
so brightly illuminated, was no longer clearly visible to the naked eye, and was rapidly decreasing
in size on account of the perspective.  But the telescopes which Clewe had provided easily
overcame this difficulty.  He was sure that it would be impossible for his light to penetrate
to a depth which could not be made clearly visible by his telescopes.

This is an atom: 
It was a wonderful and weird sensation which came over those who stood, glass in hand, and
gazed down the track of the Artesian ray.  Far, far below them they saw that illuminated disk
which revealed the character of the stratum which the light had reached.  And yet they could
not see the telescope which they held in their hands; they could not see their hands; they
knew that their heads and shoulders were invisible.  All observers except Clewe kept well back
from the edge of the frightful hole of light down which they peered; and once, when the weight
of the telescope which she held had caused Margaret to make an involuntary step forward, she
gave a fearful scream, for she was sure she was going to fall into the bowels of the earth.
Clewe, who stood always near by, with his hand upon the lever which controlled the ray, instantly
shut off the light; and although Margaret was thus convinced that she stood upon commonplace
ground, she came from within the screen, and did not for some time recover from the nervous
shock occasioned by this accident of the imagination.

This is an atom: 
Clewe himself took great pleasure in making experiments connected with the relation of the
observer to the action of the Artesian ray.  For instance, he found that when standing and
gazing down into the great photic perforation below him, he could see into it quite as well
when he shut his eyes as when they were open; the light passing through his head made his eyelids
invisible.  He stood in the very centre of the circle of light and looked down through himself.

This is an atom: 
That this application of light which he had discovered would be of the greatest possible service
in surgery, Roland Clewe well knew. By totally eliminating from view any portion of the human
body so as to expose a section of said body which it was desirable to examine, the interior
structure of a patient could be studied as easily as the exterior, and a surgeon would be able
to dissect a living being as easily as if the subject were a corpse.  But Clewe did not now
wish to make public the extraordinary adaptations of his discovery to the uses of the medical
man and the surgeon.  He was intent upon discovering, as far as was possible, the internal
structure of the earth on which he dwelt, and he did not wish to interfere at present with
this great and absorbing object by distracting his mind with any other application of his Artesian
ray.

This is an atom: 
It is not intended to describe in detail the various stages of the progress of the Artesian
ray into the subterranean regions. Sometimes it revealed strata colored red, yellow, or green
by the presence of iron ore; sometimes it showed for a short distance a glittering disk, produced
by the action of the light upon a deep-sunken reservoir of water; then it passed on, hour by
hour, down, down into the eternal rocks.

This is an atom: 
When the Artesian ray had begun to work its way through the rocks, Margaret became less interested
in observing its progress. Nothing new presented itself; it was one continual stony disk which
she saw when she looked down into the shaft of light beneath her.  Observation was becoming
more and more difficult even to Roland Clewe, and at last he was obliged to set up a large
telescope on a stand, and mount a ladder in order to use it.

This is an atom: 
Day after day the Artesian ray went downward, always revealing rock, rock, rock.  The appliances
for increased electric energy were working well, and Clewe was entirely satisfied with the
operation of his photic borer.

This is an atom: 
One morning he came hurriedly to Margaret at her house, and announced with glistening eyes
that his ray had now gone to a greater degree into the earth than man had ever yet reached.

This is an atom: 
"What have you found?" she asked, excitedly.  "Rock, rock, rock," he answered.  "This little
State of ours rests upon a firm foundation."

This is an atom: 
Although Roland Clewe found his observations rather monotonous work, he was regular and constant
at his post, and gave little opportunity to his steadily progressing cylinder of light to reach
and pass unseen anything which might be of interest.

This is an atom: 
It was nearly a week after he had announced to Margaret that he had seen deeper into the earth
than any man before him that he mounted his ladder to take his final observation for the night.
When he looked through his telescope his eye was dazzled by a light which obliged him suddenly
to close it and lift his head. At first he thought that he had reached the fabulous region
of eternal fire, but this he knew to be absurd; and, besides, the light was not that of fire
or heated substances.  It was pale, colorless; and although dazzling at first, he found, when
very cautiously he applied his eye again to the telescope, that it was not blinding.  In fact,
he could look at it as steadily as he could upon a clear sky.

This is an atom: 
But, gaze as he would, he could see nothing--nothing but light; subdued, soft, beautiful light.
He knew the ray was passing steadily downward, for the mechanism was working with its accustomed
regularity, but it revealed to him nothing at all.  He could not understand it; his brain was
dazed.  He thought there might be something the matter with his eyesight.  He got down from
the ladder and hurriedly sent for Margaret, and when she came he begged her to look through
the telescope and tell him what she saw.  She went inside the screen, ascended the ladder,
and looked down.

This is an atom: 
"It isn't anything," she called out presently.  "It looks like lighter air; it can't be that.
Perhaps there is something the matter with your telescope."

This is an atom: 
Clewe had thought of that, and as soon as she came out he examined the instrument, but the
lenses were all right.  There was nothing the matter with the telescope.

This is an atom: 
That night Roland Clewe spent in the lens-house, almost constantly at the telescope, but nothing
did he see but a disk of soft, white light.

This is an atom: 
"The world can't be hollow!" he said to Margaret the next morning.  "It can't be filled with
air, or nothing, and my ray would not illuminate air or nothing.  I cannot understand it. 
If you did not see what I see, I should think I was going crazy."

This is an atom: 
"Don't talk that way," exclaimed Margaret.  "This may be some cavity which the ray will soon
pass through, and then we shall come to the good old familiar rock again."

This is an atom: 
But Clewe could not be consoled in this way.  He could see no reason why his ray acting upon
the emptiness of a cavern should produce the effect he beheld.  Moreover, if the ray had revealed
a cavern of considerable extent he could not expect that it could now pass through it, for
the limit of its operations was almost reached.  His electric cumulators would cease to act
in a few hours more.  The ray had now descended more than fourteen miles--its limit was fifteen.

This is an atom: 
Margaret was greatly troubled because of the effect of this result of the light borer upon
Roland.  His disappointment was very great, and it showed itself in his face.  His Artesian
ray had gone down to a distance greater than had been sometimes estimated as the thickness
of the earth's crust, and the result was of no value.  Roland did not believe that the earth
had a crust.  He had no faith in the old-fashioned idea that the great central portion was
a mass of molten matter, but he could not drive from his mind the conviction that his light
had passed through the solid portion of the earth, and had emerged into something which was
not solid, which was not liquid, which was in fact nothing.

This is an atom: 
All his labors had come to this: he had discovered that the various strata near the earth's
surface rested upon a vast bed of rock, and that this bed of rock rested upon nothing.  Of
course it was not impossible that the arrangement of the substances which make up this globe
was peculiar at this point, and that there was a great cavern fourteen miles below him; but
why should such a cavern be filled with a light different from that which would be shown by
his Artesian ray when shining upon any other substances, open air or solid matter?

This is an atom: 
He could go no deeper down--at least at present.  If he could make an instrument of increased
power, it would require many months to do it.

This is an atom: 
"But I will do it," said he to Margaret.  "If this is a cavern, and if it has a bottom, I will
reach it.  I will go on and see what there is beyond.  On such a discovery as I have made one
can pass no conclusion whatever.  If I cannot go farther, I need not have gone down at all."

This is an atom: 
"No," said Margaret, "I don't want you to go on--at least at present; you must wait.  The earth
will wait, and I want you to be in a condition to be able to wait also.  You must now stop
this work altogether.  Stop doing anything; stop thinking about it.  After a time--say early
in winter--we can recommence operations with the Artesian ray; that is, if we think well to
do so.  You should stop this and take up something else.  You have several enterprises which
are very important and ought to be carried on.  Take up one of them, and think no more for
a few months of the nothingness which is fourteen miles below us."

This is an atom: 
It was not difficult for Roland Clewe to convince himself that this was very good advice. 
He resolved to shut up his lens-house entirely for a time, and think no more of the great work
he had done within it, but apply himself to something which he had long neglected, and which
would be a distraction and a recreation to his disappointed mind.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XV

This is an atom: 
THE AUTOMATIC SHELL

This is an atom: 
In a large building, not far from the lens-house in which Roland Clewe had pursued the experiments
which had come to such a disappointing conclusion, there was a piece of mechanism which interested
its inventor more than any other of his works, excepting of course the photic borer.

This is an atom: 
This was an enormous projectile, the peculiarity of which was that its motive power was contained
within itself, very much as a rocket contains the explosives which send it upward.  It differed,
however, from the rocket or any other similar projectile, and many of its features were entirely
original with Roland Clewe.

This is an atom: 
This extraordinary piece of mechanism, which was called the automatic shell, was of cylindrical
form, eighteen feet in length and four feet in diameter.  The forward end was conical and not
solid, being formed of a number of flat steel rings, decreasing in size as they approached
the point of the cone.  When not in operation these rings did not touch one another, but they
could be forced together by pressure on the point of the cone.  This shell might contain explosives
or not, as might be considered desirable, and it was not intended to fire it from a cannon,
but to start it on its course from a long semi-cylindrical trough, which would be used simply
to give it the desired direction.  After it had been started by a ram worked by an engine at
the rear end of the trough, it immediately bean to propel itself by means of the mechanism
contained within it.

This is an atom: 
But the great value of this shell lay in the fact that the moment it encountered a solid substance
or obstruction of any kind its propelling power became increased.  The rings which formed the
cone on its forward end were pressed together, the electric motive power was increased in proportion
to the pressure, and thus the greater the resistance to this projectile the greater became
its velocity and power of progression, and its onward course continued until its self-containing
force had been exhausted.

This is an atom: 
The power of explosives had reached, at this period, to so high a point that it was unnecessary
to devise any increase in their enormous energy, and the only problems before the students
of artillery practice related to methods of getting their projectiles to the points desired.
Progress in this branch of the science had proceeded so far that an attack upon a fortified
port by armored vessels was now considered as a thing of the past; and although there had been
no naval wars of late years, it was believed that never again would there be a combat between
vessels of iron or steel.

This is an atom: 
The recently invented magnetic shell made artillery practice against all vessels of iron a
mere mechanical process, demanding no skill whatever.  When one of these magnetic shells was
thrown anywhere in the vicinity of an iron ship, the powerful magnetism developed within it
instantly attracted it to the vessel, which was destroyed by the ensuing contact and explosion.
Two ironclads meeting on the ocean need each to fire but one shell to be both destroyed.  The
inability of iron battle-ships to withstand this improvement in artillery had already set the
naval architects of the world upon the work of constructing warships which would not attract
the magnetic shell--which was effective even when laid on the bottoms of harbors--and Roland
Clewe had been engaged in making plans and experiments for the construction of a paper man-of-war,
which he believed would meet the requirements of the situation.

This is an atom: 
When Clewe determined to follow Margaret Raleigh's advice and give up for a time his work with
the Artesian ray, his thoughts naturally turned to his automatic shell.  Work upon this invention
was now almost completed, but the great difficulty which its inventor expected to meet with
was that of inducing his government to make a trial of it.  Such a trial would be extremely
expensive, involving probably the destruction of the shell, and he did not feel able or willing
to experiment with it without governmental aid.

This is an atom: 
The shell was intended for use on land as well as at sea, against cities and great fortified
structures, and Clewe believed that the automatic shell might be brought within fifty miles
of a city, set up with its trough and ram, and projected in a level line towards its object,
to which it would impel itself with irresistible power and velocity, through forests, hills,
buildings, and everything, gaining strength from every opposition which stood in the direct
line of its progress.  Attacking fortifications from the sea, the vessel carrying this great
projectile could operate at a distance beyond the reach of the magnetic shell.

This is an atom: 
Now that the automatic shell itself was finished, and nothing remained to be done but to complete
the great steel trough in which it would lie, Roland Clewe found himself confronted with a
business which was very hard and very distasteful to him.  He must induce other people to do
what he was not able to do himself.  Unless his shell was put to a practical trial, it could
be of no value to the world or to himself.

This is an atom: 
In one of the many conversations on the subject; Margaret had suggested something which rapidly
grew and developed in Roland's mind.

This is an atom: 
"It would be an admirable thing to tunnel mountains with," said she.  "Of course I mean a large
one, as thick through as a tunnel ought to be."

This is an atom: 
In less than a day Clewe had perfected an idea which he believed might be of practical service.
For some time there had been talk of a new railroad in this part of the State, but one of the
difficulties in the way was the necessity of making a tunnel or a deep cut through a small
mountain.  To go round this mountain would be objectionable for many reasons, and to go through
it would be enormously expensive.  Clewe knew the country well, and his soul glowed within
him as he thought that here perhaps was an opportunity for him to demonstrate the value of
his invention, not only as an agent in warfare, but as a wonderful assistant in the peaceful
progress of the world.

This is an atom: 
There was no reason why such shells should not be constructed for the express purpose of making
tunnels.  Nothing could be better adapted for an experiment of this kind than the low mountain
in question.  If the shell passed through it at the desired point, there would be nothing beyond
which could be injured, and it would then enter the end of a small chain of mountains, and
might pass onward, as far as its motive power would carry it, without doing any damage whatever.
Moreover, its course could be followed and it could be recovered.

This is an atom: 
Both Roland and Margaret were very enthusiastic in favor of this trial of the automatic shell,
and they determined that if the railroad company would pay them a fair price if they should
succeed in tunnelling the mountain, they would charge nothing should their experiment be a
failure.  Of course the tunnel the shell would make, if everything worked properly, would not
be large enough for any practical use; but explosives might be placed along its length, which,
if desired, would blow out that portion of the mountain which lay immediately above the tunnel,
and this great cut could readily be enlarged to any desired dimensions.

This is an atom: 
Clewe would have gone immediately to confer with the secretary of the railroad company, with
whom he was acquainted.  but that gentleman was at the sea-side, and the business was necessarily
postponed.

This is an atom: 
"Now," said Clewe to Margaret, "if I could do it, I'd like to take a run up to the polar sea
and see for myself what they have discovered.  Judging from Sammy's infrequent despatches,
the party in general must be getting a little tired of Mr. Gibbs's experiments and soundings;
but I should be intensely interested in them."

This is an atom: 
"I don't wonder," answered Margaret, "that they are getting tired; they have found the pole,
and they want to come home. That is natural enough.  But, for my part, I am very glad we can't
run up there.  Even if we had another Dipsey I should decidedly oppose it.  I might agree that
we should go to Cape Tariff, but I would not agree to anything more.  You may discover poles
if you want to, but you must do it by proxy."

This is an atom: 
At this moment an awful crash was heard.  It came from the building containing the automatic
shell.  Clewe and Margaret started to their feet.  They glanced at each other, and then both
ran from the office at the top of their speed.  Other people were running from various parts
of the Works.  There was no smoke; there was no dust.  There had been no explosion, as Clewe
had feared in his first alarm.

This is an atom: 
When they entered the building, Clewe and Margaret stood aghast. There were workmen shouting
or standing with open mouths; others were running in.  The massive scaffolding, twenty feet
in height, on which the shell had been raised so that the steel trough might be run under it,
lay in splinters upon the ground.  The great automatic shell itself had entirely disappeared.

This is an atom: 
For some moments no one said anything; all stood astounded, looking at the space where the
shell had been.  Then Clewe hurried forward.  In the ground, amid the wreck of the scaffolding,
was a circular hole about four feet in diameter. Clasping the hand of a man near him, he cautiously
peered over the edge and looked down.  It was dark and deep; he saw nothing.

This is an atom: 
Roland Clewe stepped back; he put his hands over his eyes and thought.  Now he comprehended
everything clearly.  The weight of the shell had been too great for its supports.  The forward
part, which contained the propelling mechanism, was much heavier than the other end, and had
gone down first, so that the shell had turned over and had fallen perpendicularly, striking
the ground with the point of the cone.  Then its tremendous propelling energy, infinitely more
powerful than any dynamic force dreamed of in the preceding century, was instantly generated.
The inconceivably rapid motion which forced it forward like a screw must have then commenced,
and it had bored itself down deep into the solid earth.

This is an atom: 
"Roland, dear," said Margaret, stepping quietly up to him, tears on her pale countenance, "don't
you think it can be hoisted up again?"

This is an atom: 
"I hope not," said he.

This is an atom: 
"Why do you say that?" she asked, astonished.

This is an atom: 
"Because," he answered, "if it has not penetrated far enough into the earth to make it utterly
out of our power to get it again, the thing is a failure."

This is an atom: 
"More than that," thought Margaret; "if it has gone down entirely out of our reach, the thing
is a failure all the same, for I don't believe he can ever be induced to make another."

This is an atom: 
THE TRACK OF THE SHELL

This is an atom: 
During the course of his inventive life Roland Clewe had become accustomed to disappointments;
he was very much afraid, indeed, that he was beginning to expect them.  If that really happened,
there would be an end to his career.

This is an atom: 
But when he spoke in this way to Margaret, she almost scolded him.

This is an atom: 
"How utterly absurd it is," she said, "for a man who has just discovered the north pole to
sit down in an arm-chair and talk in that way!"

This is an atom: 
"I didn't discover it," he said; "it was Sammy and Gibbs who found the pole.  As for me--I
don't suppose I shall ever see it."

This is an atom: 
"I am not so sure of that," she said.  "We may yet invent a telescope which shall curve its
reflected rays over the rotundity of the earth and above the highest icebergs, so that you
and I may sit here and look at the waters of the pole gently splashing around the great buoy."

This is an atom: 
"And charge a dollar apiece to all other people who would like to look at the pole, and so
we might make much money," said he. "But I must really go and do something; I shall go crazy
if I sit here idle."

This is an atom: 
Margaret knew that the loss of the shell was the greatest blow that Roland had ever yet received.
His ambitions as a scientific inventor were varied, but she was well aware that for some years
he had considered it of great importance to do something which would bring him in money enough
to go on with his investigations and labors without depending entirely upon her for the necessary
capital.  If he could have tunnelled a mountain with this shell, or if he had but partially
succeeded in so doing, money would have come to him.  He would have made his first pecuniary
success of any importance.

This is an atom: 
"What are you going to do, Roland?" said she, as he rose to leave the room.

This is an atom: 
"I am going to find the depth of the hole that shell has made. It ought to be filled up, and
I must calculate how many loads of earth and stones it will take to do it."

This is an atom: 
That afternoon he came to Mrs. Raleigh's house.

This is an atom: 
"Margaret," he exclaimed, "I have lowered a lead into that hole with all the line attached
which we have got on the place, and we can touch no bottom.  I have telegraphed for a lot of
sounding-wire, and I must wait until it shall arrive before I do anything more."

This is an atom: 
"You must be very, very careful, Roland, when you are doing that work," said Margaret.  "Suppose
you should fall in!"

This is an atom: 
"I have provided against that," said he.  "I have laid a floor over the hole with only a small
opening in it, so there is no danger.  And another curious thing I must tell you-our line is
not wet: we have struck no water!"

This is an atom: 
When Margaret visited the Works the next day she found Roland Clewe and a number of workmen
surrounding the flooring which had been laid over the hole.  They were sounding with a windlass
which carried an immense reel of wire.  The wire was extremely thin, but the weight of that
portion of it which had already been unwound was so great that four men were at the handles
of the windlass.

This is an atom: 
Roland came to meet Margaret as she entered.

This is an atom: 
"The lead has gone down six miles," he said, in a low voice, "and we have not touched the bottom
yet."

This is an atom: 
"Impossible!" she cried.  "Roland, it cannot be!  The wire must be coiling itself up somewhere.
It is incredible!  The lead cannot have gone down so far!"

This is an atom: 
"Leads have gone down as far as that before this," said he. "Soundings of more than six miles
have been obtained at sea."

This is an atom: 
She went with him and stood near the windlass.  For an hour she remained by his side, and still
the reel turned steadily and the wire descended into the hole.

This is an atom: 
"Shall you surely know when it gets to the bottom?" said she.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," he answered.  "When the electric button under the lead shall touch anything solid, or
even anything fluid, this bell up here will ring."

This is an atom: 
She stayed until she could stay no longer.  She knew it would be of no use to urge Roland to
leave the windlass.  Very early the next morning a note was brought to her before she was up,
and on it was written:

This is an atom: 
"We have touched bottom at a depth of fourteen and an eighth miles."

This is an atom: 
When Roland came to Mrs. Raleigh's house, about nine o'clock that morning, his face was pale
and his whole form trembled.

This is an atom: 
"Margaret," he cried, "what are we going to do about it?  It is wonderful; I cannot appreciate
it.  I have had all the men up in the office this morning and pledged them to secrecy.  Of
course they won't keep their promises, but it was all that I could do. I can think of no particular
damage which would come to me if this thing were known, but I cannot bear that the public should
get hold of it until I know something myself.  Margaret, I don't know anything."

This is an atom: 
"Have you had your breakfast?" she asked.

This is an atom: 
"No," he said; "I haven't thought of it."

This is an atom: 
"Did you eat anything last night?"

This is an atom: 
"I don't remember," he answered.

This is an atom: 
"Now I want you to come into the dining-room," said she.  "I had a light breakfast some time
ago, and I am going to eat another with you.  I want you to tell me something.  There was a
man here the other day with a patent machine for making button-holes--you know the old-fashioned
button-holes are coming in again--and if this is a good invention it ought to sell, for nearly
everybody has forgotten how to make button-holes in the old way."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, nonsense!" said Roland.  "How can you talk of such things? I can't take my mind--"

This is an atom: 
"I know you can't," she interrupted.  "You are all the time thinking of that everlasting old
hole in the ground.  Well, I am tired of it; do let us talk of something else."

This is an atom: 
Margaret Raleigh was much more than tired of that phenomenal hole in the earth which had been
made by the automatic shell; she was frightened by it.  It was something terrible to her; she
had scarcely slept that night, and she needed breakfast and change of thought as much as Roland.

This is an atom: 
But it was not long before she found that it was impossible to turn his thoughts from that
all-absorbing subject.  All she could do was to endeavor to guide them into quiet channels.

This is an atom: 
"What are you going to do this morning?" she asked, towards the close of the breakfast.

This is an atom: 
"I am going to try to take the temperature of that shaft at various points," said he.

This is an atom: 
"That will be an excellent thing," she answered; "you may make valuable discoveries; but I
should think the heat at that great depth would be enough to melt your thermometers."

This is an atom: 
"It did not melt my lead or my sounding-wire," said he.  And as he said these words her heart fell.

This is an atom: 
The temperature of this great perforation was taken at many points, and when Roland brought
to Margaret the statement of the height of the mercury at the very bottom she was astounded
and shocked to find that it was only eighty-three degrees.

This is an atom: 
"This is terrible!" she ejaculated.

This is an atom: 
"What do you mean?" he asked in surprise.  "That is not hot. Why, it is only summer weather."

This is an atom: 
But she did not think it terrible because it was so hot; the fact that it was so cool had shocked
her.  In such temperature one could live!  A great source of trust and hope had been taken
from her.

This is an atom: 
"Roland," she said, sinking into a chair, "I don't understand this at all.  I always thought
that it became hotter and hotter as one went down into the earth; and I once read that at twenty
miles below the surface, if the heat increased in proportion as it increased in a mine, the
temperature must be over a thousand degrees Fahrenheit.  Your instrument could not have registered
properly; perhaps it never went all the way down; and perhaps it is all a mistake.  It may
be that the lead did not go down so far as you think."

This is an atom: 
He smiled; he was becoming calmer now, for he was doing something: he was obtaining results.

This is an atom: 
"Those ideas about increasing heat at increasing depths are old-fashioned, Margaret," he said.
"Recent science has given us better theories.  It is known that there is great heat in the
interior of the earth, and it is also known that the transmission of this heat towards the
surface depends upon the conductivity of the rocks in particular locations.  In some places
the heat comes very near the surface, and in others it is very, very far down. More than that,
the temperature may rise as we go down into the earth and afterwards fall again.  There may
be a stratum of close-grained rock, possibly containing metal, coming up from the interior
in an oblique direction and bringing the heat towards the surface; then below that there may
be vast regions of other rocks which do not readily conduct heat, and which do not originate
in heated portions of the earth's interior.  When we reach these, we must find the temperature
lower, as a matter of course.  Now I have really done this.  A little over five miles down
my thermometer registered ninety-one, and after that it began to fall a little.  But the rocks
under us are poor conductors of heat; and, moreover, it is highly probable that they have no
near communication with the source of internal heat."

This is an atom: 
"I thought these things were more exact and regular," said she; "I supposed if you went down
a mile in one place, you would find it as hot as you would in another."

This is an atom: 
"Oh no," said he.  "There is nothing regular or exact in nature; even our earth is not a perfect
sphere.  Nature is never mathematically correct.  You must always allow for variations. In
some parts of the earth its heated core, or whatever it is, must be very, very far down."

This is an atom: 
At this moment a happy thought struck Margaret.

This is an atom: 
"How easy it would be, Roland, for you to examine this great hole!  I can do it; anybody can
do it.  It's perfectly amazing when you think of it.  All you have to do is to take your Artesian,
ray machine into that building and set it over the hole; then you can light the whole interior,
all the way down to the bottom, and with a telescope you can see everything that is in it."

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said he; "but I think I can do it better than that.  It would be very difficult to transfer
the photic borer to the other building, and I can light up the interior perfectly well by means
of electric lights.  I can even lower a camera down to the very bottom and take photographs
of the interior."

This is an atom: 
"Why, that would be perfectly glorious!" cried Margaret, springing to her feet, an immense
relief coming to her mind with the thought that to examine this actual shaft it would not be
necessary for anybody to go down into it.

This is an atom: 
"I should go to work at that immediately," said he, "but I must have a different sort of windlass--one
that shall be moved by an engine.  I will rig up the big telescope too, so that we can look
down when we have lighted up the bottom."

This is an atom: 
It required days to do all that Roland Clewe had planned. A great deal of the necessary work
was done in his own establishment, and much machinery besides was sent from New York.  When
all was ready many experiments were made with the electric lights and camera, and photographs
of inexpressible value and interest were taken at various points on the sides of this wonderful
perpendicular tunnel.

This is an atom: 
At last Clewe was prepared to photograph the lower portion of the shaft.  With a peculiar camera
and a powerful light five photographs were taken of the very bottom of the great shaft, four
in horizontal directions and one immediately below the camera. When these photographs were
printed by the improved methods then in vogue, Clewe seized the pictures and examined them
with eager haste.  For some moments he stood silent, his eyes fixed upon the photographs as
if there was nothing else in this world; but all he saw on each was an irregular patch of light.
He thrust the prints aside, and in a loud, sharp voice he gave orders to bring the great telescope
and set it up above the hole.  The light was still at the bottom, and the instant the telescope
was in position Clewe mounted the stepladder and directed the instrument downward.  In a few
moments he gave an exclamation, and then he came down from the ladder so rapidly that he barely
missed falling.  He went into his office and sent for Margaret.  When she came he showed her
the photographs.

This is an atom: 
"See!" he said.  "What I have found is nothing; even a camera shows nothing, and when I look
down through the glass I see nothing.  It is just what the Artesian ray showed me; it is nothing
at all!"

This is an atom: 
"I should think," said she, speaking very slowly, "that if your sounding-lead had gone down
into nothing, it would have continued to go down indefinitely.  What was there to stop it if
there is nothing there?"

This is an atom: 
"Margaret," said he, "I don't know anything about it.  That is the crushing truth.  I can find
out nothing at all.  When I look down through the earth by means of the Artesian ray I reach
a certain depth and then I see a void; when I look down through a perfectly open passage to
the same depth, I still see a void."

This is an atom: 
"But, Roland," said Margaret, holding in her hand the view taken of the bottom of the shaft,
"what is this in the middle of the proof?  It is darker than the rest, but it seems to be all
covered up with mistiness.  Have you a magnifying-glass?"

This is an atom: 
Roland found a glass, and seized the photograph.  He had forgotten his usual courtesy.

This is an atom: 
"Margaret," he cried, "that dark thing is my automatic shell!  It is lying on its side.  I
can see the greater part of it.  It is not in the hole it made itself; it is in a cavity. 
It has turned over, and lies horizontally; it has bored down into a cave, Margaret--into a
cave--a cave with a solid bottom--a cave made of light!"

This is an atom: 
"Nonsense!" said Margaret.  "Caves cannot be made of light; the light that you see comes from
your electric lamp."

This is an atom: 
"Not at all!" he cried.  "If there was anything there, the light of my lamp would show it.
During the whole depth of the shaft the light showed everything and the camera showed everything;
you can see the very texture of the rocks; but when the camera goes to the bottom, when it
enters this space into which the shaft plainly leads, it shows nothing at all, except what
I may be said to have put there.  I see only my great shell surrounded by light, resting on light!"

This is an atom: 
"Roland," said Margaret, "you are crazy!  Perhaps it is water which fills that cave, or whatever
it is."

This is an atom: 
"Not at all," said Roland.  "It presents no appearance of water, and when the camera came up
it was not wet.  No; it is a cave of light."

This is an atom: 
He sat for some minutes silently gazing out of the window. Margaret drew her chair closer to
him.  She took one of his hands in both of hers.

This is an atom: 
"Look at me, Roland!" she said.  "What are you thinking about?"

This is an atom: 
He turned his face upon her, but said nothing.  She looked straight into his eyes, and she
needed no Artesian ray to enable her to see through them into his innermost brain.  She saw
what was filling that brain; it was one great, overpowering desire to go down to the bottom
of that hole, to find out what it was that he had discovered.

This is an atom: 
"Margaret, you hurt me!" he exclaimed, suddenly.  In the intensity of the emotion excited by
what she had discovered, her finger-nails had nearly penetrated through his skin.  She had
felt as if she would hold him and hold him forever, but she released his hand.

This is an atom: 
"We haven't talked about that button-hole machine," she said.  "I want your opinion of it."
To her surprise, Roland began immediately to discuss the new invention of which she had spoken,
and asked her to describe it.  He was not at all anxious now to tell Margaret what he was thinking
of in connection with the track of the shell.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XVII

This is an atom: 
CAPTAIN HUBBELL DECLINES TO GO WHALING

This is an atom: 
The most impatient person on board the Dipsey was Captain Jim Hubbell.  Sarah Block was also
very anxious to go home as soon as matters could be arranged for the return journey, and she
talked a great deal of the terrible fate which would be sure to overtake them if they should
be so unfortunate as to stay until the season of the arctic night; but, after all, she was
not as impatient as Captain Hubbell.  She simply wanted to go home; but he not only greatly
desired to return to his wife and family, but he wanted to do something else before he started
south; he wanted to go whaling.  He considered himself the only man in the whole world who
had a chance to go whaling, and he chafed as he thought of the hindrances which Mr. Gibbs was
continually placing in the way of this, the grandest of all sports.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Gibbs was a mild man, and rather a quiet one; but he thoroughly understood the importance
of the investigations he was pursuing in the polar sea, and placed full value upon the opportunity
which had come to him of examining the wonders of a region hitherto locked up from civilized
man.  Captain Hubbell was astonished to find that Mr. Gibbs was as hard and unyielding as an
iceberg during his explorations and soundings.  It was of no use to talk to him of whaling;
he had work before him, and he must do it.

This is an atom: 
But the time came when Mr. Gibbs relented.  The Dipsey had sailed around the whole boundary
of the polar sea; observations, surveys, and maps had been made, and the general geography
of the region had been fairly well determined.  There still remained some weeks of the arctic
day, and it was desirable that they should begin their return journey during that time; so
Mr. Gibbs informed Captain Jim that if he wanted to do a little whaling, he would like him
to lose no time.

This is an atom: 
Almost from the time of their arrival in the polar sea the subject of whales had greatly interested
everybody on the Dipsey. Even Rovinski, who had been released from his confinement after a
few days, because he had really committed no actual crime except that of indulging in overleaping
ambition, had spent every available minute of leisure in looking for whales.  It was strange
that nothing in this Northern region interested the people on the Dipsey (with the sole exception
of Mr. Gibbs) so much as these great fish, which seemed to be the only visible inhabitants
of the polar solitudes. There were probably white bears somewhere on the icy shores about them,
but they never showed themselves; and if birds were there, they did not fly over that sea.

This is an atom: 
There was reason to suppose that there were a good many whales in the polar sea.  Wherever
our party sailed, lay to, or anchored for a time, they were very sure, before long, to see
a whale curving his shining black back into the light, or sending two beautiful jets of water
up into the air.  Whenever a whale was seen, somebody on board was sure to remark that these
creatures in this part of the world seemed to be very tame.  It was not at all uncommon to
see one disport himself at no great distance from the vessel for an hour or more.

This is an atom: 
"If I could get among a school of whales anywhere around Nantucket and find 'em as tame as
these fellers," said Captain Jim, "I'd give a boom to the whale-oil business that it hasn't
had for forty years."

This is an atom: 
But not long before Mr. Gibbs told the captain that he might go whaling if he felt like it,
the old sailor had experienced a change of mind.  He had become a most ardent student of whales.
In his very circumscribed experience when a young man he had seen whales, but they had generally
been a long way off; and as the old-fashioned method of rowing after them in boats had even
then been abandoned in favor of killing them by means of the rifled cannon, Captain Hubbell
had not seen very much of these creatures until they had been towed alongside.  But now he
could study whales at his leisure.  It was seldom that he had to wait very long before he would
see one near enough for him to examine it with a glass, and he never failed to avail himself
of such opportunities.

This is an atom: 
The consequence of this constant and careful inspection was the conclusion in Captain Hubbell's
mind that there was only one whale in the polar sea.  He had noticed, and others had noticed,
that they never saw two at once, and the captain had used his glass so often and so well that
one morning he stamped his foot upon the deck and said to Sammy:

This is an atom: 
"I believe that's the same whale over and over and over ag'in.  I know him like a book; he
has his ways and his manners, and it isn't reasonable to suppose that every whale has the same
ways and manners.  He comes just so near the vessel, and then he stops and blows.  Then he
suns his back for a while, and then he throws up his flukes and sounds.  He does that as regular
as if he was a polar clock.  I know the very shape of his flukes; and two or three days ago,
as he was soundin', I thought that the tip of the upper one looked as if it had been damaged--as
if he had broken it floppin' about in some tight place; and ever since, when I have seen a
whale, I have looked for the tip of that upper fluke, and there's that same old break.  Every
time I have looked I have found it.  It can't be that there are a lot o' whales in here and
each one of 'em with a battered fluke."

This is an atom: 
"That does look sort o' queer," said Sammy, reflectively.

This is an atom: 
"Sammy Block," said Captain Jim, impressively, "it's my opinion that there's only one whale
in this here polar sea; an', more than that, it's my opinion that there's only one whale in
this world, an' that that feller we've seen is the one!  Samuel Block, he's the last whale
in the whole world!  Now you know that I wanted to go a-whalin'--that's natural enough--but
since Mr. Gibbs has got through, and has said that I could take this vessel an' go a-whalin'
if I wanted to--which would be easy enough, for we have got guns aboard which would kill any
right-whale--I don't want to go.  I don't want to lay on my dyin' bed an' think that I'm the
man that killed the last whale in the world.  I'm commandin' this vessel, and I sail it wherever
Mr. Gibbs tells me to sail it; but if he wants the bones of a whale to take home as a curiosity,
an' tells me to sail this vessel after that whale, I won't do it."

This is an atom: 
"I'm with you there," said Sammy.  "I have been thinkin' while you was talkin', an' it's my
opinion that it's not only the last whale in the world, but it's purty nigh tame.  I believe
it's so glad to see some other movin' creature in this lonely sea that it wants to keep company
with us all the time.  No, sir, I wouldn't have anything to do with killin' that fish!"

This is an atom: 
The opinions of the captain and Sammy were now communicated to the rest of the company on board,
and nearly all of them thought that they had had such an idea themselves.  The whale certainly
looked very familiar every time he showed himself.

This is an atom: 
To Mr. Gibbs this lonely creature, if he were such, now became an object of intense interest.
It was evidently a specimen of the right-whale, once common in the Northern seas, skeletons
of which could be seen in many museums.  Nothing would be gained to science by his capture,
and Mr. Gibbs agreed with the others that it would be a pity to harm this, the last of his race.

This is an atom: 
In thinking and talking over the matter Mr. Gibbs formed a theory which he thought would explain
the presence of this solitary whale in the polar sea.  He thought it very likely that it had
gotten under the ice and had pursued its northern journey very much as the Dipsey had pursued
hers, and had at last emerged, as she had, into the polar sea at a place perhaps as shallow
as that where the submarine vessel came out from under the ice.

This is an atom: 
"And if that's the case," said Captain Hubbell, "it is ten to one that he has not been able
to get out again, and has found himself here caught just as if he was in a trap.  Fishes don't
like to swim into tight places.  They may do it once, but they don't want to do it again. 
It is this disposition that makes 'em easy to catch in traps.  I believe you are right, Mr.
Gibbs.  I believe this whale has got in here and can't get out--or, at least, he thinks he
can't--and nobody knows how long it's been since he first got in.  It may have been a hundred
years ago.  There's plenty o' little fish in these waters for him to eat, and he's the only
one there is to feed."

This is an atom: 
The thought that in this polar sea with themselves was a great whale, which was probably here
simply because he could not get out, had a depressing effect upon the minds of the party on
the Dipsey.  There was perhaps no real reason why they should fear the fate of the great fish,
but, after all, this subject was one which should be very seriously considered.  The latter
part of their passage under the ice had been very hazardous.  Had they struck a sharp rock
below them, or had they been pierced by a jagged mass of ice above them, there probably would
have been a speedy end of the expedition; and now, having come safely out of that dangerous
shallow water, they shrank from going into it again.

This is an atom: 
It was the general opinion that if they would sail a considerable distance to the eastward
they could not fail to find a deep channel by which the waters of this sea communicated with
Baffin's Bay; but in this case they would be obliged to leave the line of longitude by which
they had safely travelled from Cape Tariff to the pole and seek another route southward, along
some other line, which would end their journey they knew not where.

This is an atom: 
"I am cold," said Sarah Block.  "At first I got along all right, with all these furs, and goin'
down-stairs every time I felt chilly, but the freezin' air is beginnin' to go into my very
bones like needles; and if winter is comin' on, and it's goin' to be worse than this, New Jersey
is the place for me.  But there's one thing that chills my blood clammier than even the cold
weather, and that is the thought of that whale follerin' us.  If we get down into those shaller
places under the ice an' he takes it into his head to come along, he'll be worse than a bull
in a china-shop.  I don't mean to say that I think he'll want to do us any harm, for he has
never shown any sign of such a feelin', but if he takes to bouncin' and thrashin' when he scratches
himself on any rocks, it'll be a bad box for us to be in."

This is an atom: 
None of the others shared these special fears of Mrs. Block, but they were all as much disinclined
as she was to begin another submarine voyage in the shallow waters which they had been so glad
to leave.

This is an atom: 
It was believed, from the general contour of the surrounding region, that if the ice were all
melted away it would be seen that a cape projected from the American continent eastward at
the point where they had entered the polar sea, and that it was in crossing the submerged continuation
of this cape that they had found the shallow water.  Beyond and southward they knew that the
water was deep and safe.  If they could reach that portion of the sea without crossing the
shallow point, they would have no fears regarding their return voyage.  They knew how far south
it was that that deep water lay, and the questions before them related to the best means of
reaching it.

This is an atom: 
At a general council of officers, Sammy and Captain Hubbell both declared that they were not
willing to take any other path homeward except one which led along the seventieth line of longitude.
That had brought them safely up, and it would take them safely down.  If they went under the
ice at some point eastward, how were they to find the seventieth line of longitude? They could
not take observations down there; and they might have to go south on some other line, which
would take them nobody knew where.  Mr. Gibbs said little, but he believed that it would be
well to go back the way they came.

This is an atom: 
At last a plan was proposed by Mr. Marcy, and adopted without dissent.  The whole country which
lay in the direction they wished to travel seemed to be an immense plain of ice and snow, with
mountains looming up towards the west and in the far southeast.  In places great slabs of ice
seemed to be piled up into craggy masses, but in general the surface of the country was quite
level, indicating underlying water.  In fact, a little east of the point where they had entered
the polar sea great cracks and reefs, some of them extending nearly a mile inward, broke up
the shore line.  The party on the Dipsey were fully able to travel over smooth ice and frozen
snow, for this contingency had been thought of and provided for; but to take the Dipsey on
an overland journey would, of course, be impossible.  By Mr. Marcy's plan, however, it was
thought that it would be quite feasible for the Dipsey to sail inland until she had reached
a point where they were sure the deep sea lay serenely beneath the ice around them.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XVIII

This is an atom: 
Mr. MARCY'S CANAL

This is an atom: 
The twelve men and the one woman on board the Dipsey, now lying at anchor in the polar sea,
were filled with a warming and cheering ardor as they began their preparations for the homeward
journey, although these preparations included what was to all of them a very painful piece
of work.  It was found that it would be absolutely necessary to disengage themselves from the
electric cord which in all their voyaging in these desolate arctic regions, under water and
above water, had connected them with the Works of Roland Clewe at Sardis, New Jersey.  A sufficient
length of this cord, almost too slight to be called cable, to reach from Cape Tariff to the
pole, with a margin adequate for all probable emergencies, had been placed on board the Dipsey,
and it was expected that on her return these slender but immensely strong wires would be wound
up, instead of being let out, and so still connect the vessel with Mr. Clewe's office.

This is an atom: 
But the Dipsey had sailed in such devious ways and in so many directions that she had laid
a great deal of the cable upon the bottom of the polar sea, and it would be difficult, or perhaps
impossible, to sail back over her previous tracks and take it up again; and there was not enough
of it left for her to proceed southward very far and still keep up her telegraphic communication.
Consequently it was considered best, upon starting southward, that they should cut loose from
all connection with their friends and the rest of the world.  They would have to do this anyway
in a short time.  If they left the end of the wire in some suitable position on the coast of
the polar sea, it might prove of subsequent advantage to science, whereas if they cut loose
when they were submerged in the ocean, this cable from Cape Tariff to the pole must always
be absolutely valueless.  It was therefore determined to build a little house, for which they
had the material, and place therein a telegraph instrument connected with the wire, and provided
with one of the Collison batteries, which would remain in working order with a charge sufficient
to last for forty years, and this, with a ground-wire run down through the ice to the solid
earth, might make telegraphic communication possible to some subsequent visitor to the pole.

This is an atom: 
But apart from the necessity of giving up connection with Sardis, the journey did not seem
like such a strange and solemn progress through unknown regions as the northern voyage had
been.  If they could get themselves well down into the deep sea at a point on the seventieth
line of longitude, they would sail directly south with every confidence of emerging safely
into Baffin's Bay.

This is an atom: 
The latest telegrams between Sardis and the polar sea were composed mostly of messages of the
warmest friendship and encouragement.  If Mr. Clewe and Mrs. Raleigh felt any fears as to the
success of the first part of the return journey, they showed no signs of them, and Sammy never
made any reference to his wife's frequently expressed opinion that there was good reason to
believe that the end of this thing would be that the Dipsey, with everybody on board of her,
would suddenly, by one of those mishaps which nobody can prevent, be blown into fine dust.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Marcy's plan was a very simple one.  The Dipsey carried a great store of explosive appliances
of various patterns and of the most improved kinds, and some of them of immense power, and
Mr. Marcy proposed that a long line of these should be laid over the level ice and then exploded.
The ice below them would be shivered into atoms, and he believed that an open channel might
thus be made, through which the Dipsey might easily proceed. Then another line of explosives
would be laid ahead of the vessel, and the length of the canal increased.  This would be a
slow method of proceeding, but it was considered a sure one.

This is an atom: 
As to the progress over the snow and ice of those who were to lay the lines of shells, that
would be easy enough.  It had been supposed that it might be necessary for the party to make
overland trips, and for this purpose twenty or more electric-motor sledges had been provided.
These sledges were far superior to any drawn by dogs or reindeer; each one of them, mounted
on broad runners of aluminium, was provided with a small engine, charged at the vessel with
electricity enough to last a week, and was propelled by means of a light metal wheel with sharp
points upon its outer rim.  This wheel was under the fore part of the sledge, and, revolving
rapidly, its points caught in the ice or frozen snow and propelled the sledge at a good rate
of speed. The wheel could be raised or lowered, so that its points should take more or less
hold of the ice, according as circumstances demanded.  In descending a declivity it could be
raised entirely, so that the person on the sledge might coast, and it could at any time be
brought down hard to act as a brake.

This is an atom: 
As soon as it was possible to get everything in order, a party of six men, on electric sledges,
headed by Mr. Marcy, started southward over the level ice, carrying with them a number of shells,
which were placed in a long line, and connected by an electric wire with the Dipsey.  When
the party had returned and the shells were exploded, the most sanguine anticipations of Mr.
Marcy were realized.  A magnificent canal three miles long lay open to the south.

This is an atom: 
Now the anchor of the Dipsey was weighed, and our party bade farewell to the polar sea.  The
great ball buoy, with its tall pole and weathervane, floated proudly over the northern end
of the earth's axis.  The little telegraph-house was all in order, and made as secure as possible,
and under it the Dipsey people made a "cache" of provisions, leaving a note in several languages
to show what they had done.

This is an atom: 
"If the whale wants to come ashore to get somethin' to eat and send a message, why, here's
his chance!" said Sammy; "but it strikes me that if any human beings ever reach this pole again,
they won't come the way we came, and they'll not see this little house, for it won't take many
snow-storms--even if they are no worse than some of those we have seen--to cover it up out
o' sight."

This is an atom: 
"I don't believe the slightest good will ever result on account of leaving this instrument
here," said Mr. Gibbs; "but it seemed the right thing to do, and I would not be satisfied to
go away and leave the useless end of the cable in these regions.  We will set up the highest
rod we have by the little house, and then we can do no more."

This is an atom: 
When the Dipsey started, everybody on board looked over the stern to see if they could catch
a glimpse of their old companion, the whale.  Nearly all of them were sorry that it was necessary
to go away and desert this living being in his lonely solitude.  They had not entered the canal
when they saw the whale.  Two tall farewell spouts rose into the air, and then his tail with
its damaged fluke was lifted aloft and waved in a sort of gigantic adieu.  Cheers and shouts
of good-bye came from the Dipsey, and the whale disappeared from their sight.

This is an atom: 
"I hope he won't come up under us," said Mrs. Block.  "But I don't believe he will do that.
He always kept at a respectful distance, and as long as we are goin' to sail in a canal, I
wouldn't mind in the least if he followed us.  But as for goin' under water with him--I don't
want anybody to speak of it."

This is an atom: 
Our exploring party now found their arctic life much more interesting than it had lately been,
for, from time to time, they were all enabled to leave the vessel and travel, if not upon solid
land, upon very solid ice.  The Dipsey carried several small boats, and even Sarah Block frequently
landed and took a trip upon a motor sledge.  Sometimes the ice was rough, or the frozen snow
was piled up into hillocks, and in such cases it was easy enough to walk and draw the light
sledges; but as a general thing the people on the sledges were able to travel rapidly and pleasantly.
The scenery was rather monotonous, with its everlasting stretches of ice and snow, but in the
far distance the mountains loomed up in the beautiful colors given them by an arctic atmosphere,
and the rays of the sun still brightened the landscape at all hours.  Occasionally animals,
supposed to be arctic foxes, were seen at a great distance, and there were those in the company
who declared that they had caught sight of a bear. But hunting was not encouraged.  The party
had no need of fresh meat, and there was important work to be done which should not be interfered
with by sporting expeditions.

This is an atom: 
There were days of slow progress, but of varied and often exciting experiences, for sometimes
the line of Mr. Marcy's canal lay through high masses of ice, and here the necessary blasting
was often of a very startling character.  They expected to cease their overland journey before
they reached the mountains, which on the south and west were piled up much nearer to them than
those in other quarters, but they were surprised to find their way stopped much sooner than
they had expected it would be by masses of icebergs, which stood up in front of them out of
the snowy plain.

This is an atom: 
When they were within a few miles of these glittering eminences they ceased further operations
and held a council.  It was perfectly possible to blow a great hole in the ice and descend
into the sea at this point, but they would have preferred going farther south before beginning
their submarine voyage.  To the eastward of the icebergs they could see with their glasses
great patches of open water, and this would have prevented the making of a canal around the
icebergs, for it would have been impossible to survey the route on sledges or to lay the line
of bombs.

This is an atom: 
A good deal of discussion followed, during which Captain Hubbell strongly urged the plan of
breaking a path to the open water, and finding out what could be done in the way of sailing
south in regular nautical fashion.  If the Dipsey could continue her voyage above water he
was in favor of her doing it, but even Captain Jim Hubbell could give no good reason for believing
that if the vessel got into the open water the party would not be obliged to go into winter-quarters
in these icy regions; for in a very few weeks the arctic winter would be upon them.  Once under
the water, they would not care whether it was light or dark, but in the upper air it would
be quite another thing.

This is an atom: 
So Captain Hubbell's plan was given up, but it was generally agreed that it would be a very
wise thing, before they took any further steps, to ascend one of the icebergs in front of them
and see what was on the other side.

This is an atom: 
The mountain-climbing party consisted of Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Marcy, and three of the most active
of the men.  Sammy Block wanted to go with them, but his wife would not allow him to do it.

This is an atom: 
"You can take possession of poles, Sammy," said she, "for that is the thing you are good at,
but when it comes to slidin' down icebergs on the small of your back you are out of place;
and if I get that house that Mr. Clewe lives in now, but which he is goin' to give up when
he gets married, I don't want to live there alone.  I can't think of nothin' dolefuler than
a widow with a polar rheumatism, and that's what I'm pretty sure I'm goin' to have."

This is an atom: 
The ascent of the nearest iceberg was not such a difficult piece of work as it would have been
in the days when Sammy Block and Captain Hubbell were boys.  The climbers wore ice-shoes with
leather suckers on the soles, such as the feet of flies are furnished with, so that it was
almost impossible for them to slip; and when they came to a sloping surface, where it was too
steep for them to climb, they made use of a motor sledge furnished with a wheel different from
the others.  Instead of points, this wheel had on its outer rim a series of suckers, similar
to those upon the soles of the shoes of the party.  As the wheel, which was of extraordinary
strength, revolved, it held its rim tightly to whatever surface it was pressed against, without
reference to the angle of said surface.  In 1941, with such a sledge, Martin Gallinet, a Swiss
guide, ascended seventy-five feet of a perpendicular rock face on Monte Rosa. The sledge, slowly
propelled by its wheel, went up the face of the rock as if it had been a fly climbing up a
pane of glass, and Gallinet, suspended below this sledge by a strap under his arms, was hauled
to the top of the precipice.

This is an atom: 
It was not necessary to climb any such precipices in ascending an iceberg, but there were some
steep slopes, and up these the party were safely carried, one by one, by what they called their
Fly-foot Sledge.

This is an atom: 
After an hour or two of climbing, our party safely reached the topmost point of the iceberg,
and began to gaze about them.  They soon found that beyond them there were other peaks and
pinnacles, and that it would have been difficult to make a circuit which would enable them
to continue Mr. Marcy's plan of a canal along the level ice.  Far beyond them, to the south,
ice hills and ice mountains were scattered here and there.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly Mr. Gibbs gave a shout of surprise.

This is an atom: 
"I have been here before," said he.

This is an atom: 
"Of course you have," replied Mr. Marcy.  "This is Lake Shiver. Don't you see, away over there
on the other side of the open water below us, that little dark spot in the icy wall?  That
is the frozen polar bear.  Take your glass and see if it isn't."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XIX

This is an atom: 
THE ICY GATEWAY

This is an atom: 
When Mr. Gibbs and his party returned to the Dipsey, after descending the iceberg, their report
created a lively sensation.

This is an atom: 
"Why, it's like goin' home," said Mrs. Block.  "Perhaps I may find my shoes."

This is an atom: 
It was not a very strange thing that they should have again met with this little ice-locked
lake, for they had endeavored to return by a route as directly south as the other had been
directly north.  But no one had expected to see the lake again, and they were not only surprised,
but pleased and encouraged. Here was a spot where they knew the water was deep enough for perfectly
safe submarine navigation, and if they could start here under the ice they would feel quite
sure that they would meet with no obstacles on the rest of their voyage.

This is an atom: 
As there was no possible entrance to this lake from the point where the Dipsey now lay at the
end of her canal, Sammy proposed that they should make a descent into the water at the place
where they were, if, after making soundings, they should find the depth sufficient.  Then they
might proceed southward as well as if they should start from Lake Shiver.

This is an atom: 
But this did not suit Mr. Gibbs.  He had a very strong desire to reach the waters of the little
lake, because he knew that at their bottom lay the telegraphic cable which he had been obliged
to abandon, and he had thought he might be able to raise this cable and re-establish telegraphic
communication with Cape Tariff and New Jersey.

This is an atom: 
Sammy thought that Mr. Gibbs's desire could be accomplished by sinking into the water in which
they now lay and sailing under the icebergs to the lake, but Mr. Gibbs did not favor this.
He was afraid to go under the icebergs.  To be sure, they had already sailed under one of them
when the Dipsey had made her way northward from the lake, but they had found that the depth
of water varied very much in different places, and the icebergs in front of them might be heavier,
and therefore more deeply sunken, than those which they had previously passed under.

This is an atom: 
If it were possible to extend their canal to Lake Shiver, Mr. Gibbs wanted to do it, but if
they should fail in this, then, of course, they would be obliged to go down at this or some
adjacent spot.

This is an atom: 
"It's all very well," said Captain Hubbell, who was a little depressed in spirits because the
time was rapidly approaching when he would no longer command the vessel, "but it's one thing
to blow a canal through fields of flat ice, and another to make it all the way through an iceberg;
but if you think you can do it, I am content.  I'd like to sail above water just as far as
we can go."

This is an atom: 
Mr. Gibbs had been studying the situation, and some ideas relating to the solution of the problem
before him were forming themselves in his mind.  At last he hit upon a plan which he thought
might open the waters of Lake Shiver to the Dipsey, and, as it would not take very long to
test the value of his scheme, it was determined to make the experiment.

This is an atom: 
There were but few on board who did not know that if a needle were inserted into the upper
part of a large block of ice, and were then driven smartly into it, the ice would split.  Upon
this fact Mr. Gibbs based his theory of making an entrance to the lake.

This is an atom: 
A climbing party, larger than the previous one, set out for the iceberg, carrying with them,
on several sledges, a long and heavy iron rod, which was a piece of the extra machinery on
the Dipsey, and some explosives of a special kind.

This is an atom: 
When the iceberg had been reached, several of the party ascended with a hoisting apparatus,
and with this the rod was hauled to the top and set up perpendicularly on a central spot at
the summit of the iceberg, the pointed end downward, and a bomb of great power fastened to
its upper end.  This bomb was one designed to exert its whole explosive power in one direction,
and it was so placed that this force would be exerted downward.  When all was ready, the electric-wire
attachment to the bomb was carried down the iceberg and carefully laid on the ice as the party
returned to the Dipsey.

This is an atom: 
Everybody, of course, was greatly interested in this experiment. The vessel was at least two
miles from the iceberg, but in the clear atmosphere the glittering eminence could be plainly
seen, and, with a glass, the great iron rod standing high up on its peak was perfectly visible.
All were on deck when Mr. Gibbs stood ready to discharge the bomb on top of the rod, and all
eyes were fixed upon the iceberg.

This is an atom: 
There was an explosion--not very loud, even considering the distance--and those who had glasses
saw the rod disappear downward.  Then a strange grating groan came over the snow-white plain,
and the great iceberg was seen to split in half, its two peaks falling apart from each other.
The most distant of the two great sections toppled far backward, and with a great crash turned
entirely over, its upper part being heavier than its base. It struck an iceberg behind it,
slid upon the level ice below, crashed through this, and sank out of sight.  Then it was seen
to slowly rise again, but this time with its base uppermost.  The other and nearest section,
much smaller, fell against an adjacent iceberg, where it remained leaning for some minutes,
but soon assumed an erect position.  The line of cleavage had not been perpendicular, and the
greater part of the base of the original iceberg remained upon the nearer section.

This is an atom: 
When the scene of destruction had been thoroughly surveyed from the deck of the Dipsey, volunteers
were called for to go and investigate the condition of affairs near the broken iceberg. Four
men, including Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Marcy, went out upon this errand, a dangerous one, for they
did not know how far the ice in their direction might have been shattered or weakened by the
wreck of the iceberg.  They found that little or no damage had been done to the ice between
them and the nearer portion of the berg, and, pursing an eastward course on their sledges,
they were enabled to look around this lofty mass and see a body of open water in the vicinity
of the more distant section almost covered with floating ice.  Pressing forward still farther
eastward, and going as far south as they dared, they were enabled at last to see that the two
portions of the original iceberg were floating at a considerable distance from each other,
and that, therefore, there was nothing to prevent the existence of an open passage between
them into the lake.

This is an atom: 
When the party returned with this report work was suspended, but the next day blasting parties
went out.  The canal was extended to the base of the nearer iceberg, a small boat was rowed
around it, and after a careful survey it was found that unless the sections of the iceberg
moved together there was plenty of room for the Dipsey to pass between them.

This is an atom: 
When the small boat and the sledges had returned to the vessel, and everything was prepared
for the start along the canal and into the lake, one of the men came to Captain Hubbell and
reported that the Pole Rovinski was absent.  For one brief moment a hope arose in the soul
of Samuel Block that this man might have fallen overboard and floated under the ice, but he
was not allowed to entertain this pleasant thought.  Mr. Marcy had seized a glass, and with
it was sweeping the icy plain in all directions.

This is an atom: 
"Hello!" he cried.  "Someone come here!  Do you see that moving speck off there to the north?
I believe that is the scoundrel."

This is an atom: 
Several glasses were now directed to the spot.

This is an atom: 
"It is the Pole!" cried Sammy.  "He has stolen a sledge and is running away!"

This is an atom: 
"Where on earth can he be running to?" exclaimed Mr. Gibbs.  "The man is insane!"

This is an atom: 
Mr. Marcy said nothing.  His motor sledge, a very fine one, furnished with an unusually large
wheel, was still on the deck. He rushed towards it.

This is an atom: 
"I am going after him!" he shouted.  "Let somebody come with me. He's up to mischief!  He must
not get away!"

This is an atom: 
"Mischief!" exclaimed Mr. Gibbs.  "I don't see what mischief he can do.  He can't live out
here without shelter; he'll be dead before morning."

This is an atom: 
"Not he," cried Sammy.  "He's a born devil, with a dozen lives! Take a gun with you, Mr. Marcy,
and shoot him if you can't catch him!"

This is an atom: 
Mr. Marcy took no gun; he had no time to stop for that.  In a few moments he was on the ice
with his sledge, then away he went at full speed towards the distant moving black object.

This is an atom: 
Two men were soon following Mr. Marcy, but they were a long way behind him, for their sledges
did not carry them at the speed with which he was flying over the ice and snow.

This is an atom: 
It was not long before Rovinski discovered that he was pursued, and, frequently turning his
head backward, he saw that the foremost sledge was gaining upon him; but, crouching as low
as he could to avoid a rifle-shot, he kept on his way.

This is an atom: 
But he could not help turning his head every now and then, and at one of these moments his
sledge struck a projecting piece of ice and was suddenly overturned.  Rovinski rolled out on
the hard snow, and the propelling wheel revolved rapidly in the air.  The Pole gathered himself
up quickly and turned his sledge back into its proper position.  He did this in such haste
that he forgot that the wheel was still revolving, and therefore was utterly unprepared to
see the sledge start away at a great speed, leaving him standing on the snow, totally overwhelmed
by astonishment and rage.

This is an atom: 
Marcy was near enough to view this catastrophe, and he stopped his sledge and burst out laughing.
Now that the fellow was secure, Marcy would wait for his companions.  When the others had reached
him, the three proceeded towards Rovinski, who was standing facing them and waiting.  As soon
as they came within speaking distance he shouted:

This is an atom: 
"Stop where you are!  I have a pistol, and I will shoot you in turn if you come any nearer.
I am a free man!  I have a right to go where I please.  I have lost my sledge, but I can walk.
Go back and tell your masters I have left their service."

This is an atom: 
Mr. Marcy reflected a moment.  He was armed, but it was with a very peculiar weapon, intended
for use on shipboard in case of mutinous disturbances.  It was a pistol with a short range,
carrying an ammonia shell.  If he could get near enough to Rovinski, he could settle his business
very quickly; but he believed that the pistol carried by the Pole was of the ordinary kind,
and dangerous.

This is an atom: 
Something must be done immediately.  It was very cold; they must soon return to the vessel.
Suddenly, without a word, Mr. Marcy started his sledge forward at its utmost speed.  The Pole
gave a loud cry and raised his right hand, in which he held a heavy pistol.  For some minutes
he had been standing, his glove off, and this pistol clasped in his hand.  He was so excited
that he had entirely forgotten the intense coldness of the air.  He attempted to aim the pistol
and to curl his forefinger around the trigger, but his hand and wrist were stiff, his fingers
were stiff.  His pistol-barrel pointed at an angle downward; he had no power to straighten
it or to pull the trigger.  Standing thus, his face white with the rage of impotence and his
raised hand shaking as if it had been palsied, he was struck full in the face with the shell
from Marcy's wide-mouthed pistol.  The brittle capsule burst, and in a second, insensible from
the fumes of the powerful ammonia it contained, Rovinski fell flat upon the snow.

This is an atom: 
When the Pole had been taken back to the vessel, and had been confined below, Mr. Gibbs, utterly
unable to comprehend the motives of the man in thus rushing off to die alone amid the rigors
of the polar regions, went down to talk to him.  At first Rovinski refused to make any answers
to the questions put to him, but at last, apparently enraged by the imputation that he must
be a weak-minded, almost idiotic, man to behave himself in such an imbecile fashion, he suddenly
blazed out:

This is an atom: 
"Imbecile!" he cried.  "Weak-minded!  If it had not been for that accursed sledge, I would
have shown you what sort of an imbecile I am.  I can't get away now, and I will tell you how
I would have been an idiot.  I would have gone back to the pole, at least to the little house,
where, like a fool, you left the end of your cable open to me, open to anybody on board who
might be brave enough to take advantage of your imbecility.  I had food enough with me to last
until I got back to the pole, and I knew of the 'cache' which you left there.  Long, long before
you ever reached Cape Tariff, and before your master was ready to announce your discoveries
to the world, I would have been using your cable.  I would have been announcing my discoveries,
not in a cipher, but in plain words; not to Sardis, but to the Observatory at St. Petersburg.
I would have proclaimed the discovery of the pole, I would have told of your observations and
your experiments; for I am a man of science, I know these things.  I would have had the honor
and the glory.  The north pole would have been Rovinski's Pole; that open sea would have been
Rovinski's Sea.  All you might have said afterwards would have amounted to nothing; it would
have been an old story; I would have announced it long before.  The glory would have been mine--mine
for all ages to come."

This is an atom: 
"But, you foolish man," exclaimed Mr. Gibbs, "you would have perished up there--no fire, no
shelter but that cabin, and very little food.  Even if, kept warm and alive by your excitement
and ambition, you had been able to send one message, you would have perished soon afterwards."

This is an atom: 
"What of that?" said Rovinski.  "I would have sent my message; I would have told how the north
pole was found.  The glory and the honor would have been mine."

This is an atom: 
When Mr. Gibbs related what was said at this interview, Sammy remarked that it was a great
pity to interfere with ambition like that, and Sarah acknowledged to her husband, but to him
only, that she had never felt her heart sink as it had sunk when she saw Mr. Marcy coming back
with that black-faced and black-hearted Pole with him.

This is an atom: 
"I felt sure," said she, "that we had got rid of him, and that after this we would not be a
party of thirteen.  It does seem to me as if it is wicked to take such a creature back to civilized
people.  It's like carrying diseases about in your clothes, as people used to do in olden times."

This is an atom: 
"Well," said Sammy, "if we could fumigate this vessel and feel sure that only the bad germs
would shrivel, I'd be in favor of doin' it."

This is an atom: 
In less than two hours after the return of Mr. Marcy with his prisoner, the Dipsey started
along the recently made canal, carefully rounded the nearer portion of the broken iceberg,
and slowly sailed between the two upright sections.  These were sufficiently far apart to afford
a perfectly safe passage, but the hearts of those who gazed up on their shining, precipitous
sides were filled with a chilling horror, for if a wind had suddenly sprung up, these two great
sections of the icy mountain might have come together, cracking the Dipsey as if it had been a nut.

This is an atom: 
But no wind sprang up; the icebergs remained as motionless as if they had been anchored, and
the Dipsey entered safely the harboring waters of Lake Shiver.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XX

This is an atom: 
"THAT IS HOW I LOVE YOU"

This is an atom: 
For several days the subject of the great perforation made by the automatic shell was not mentioned
between Margaret and Roland. This troubled her a great deal, for she thoroughly understood
her lover's mind, and she knew that he had something important to say to her, but was waiting
until he had fully elaborated his intended statement.  She said nothing about it, because it
was impossible for her to do so.  It made her feel sick even to think of it, and yet she was
thinking of it all the time.

This is an atom: 
At last he came to her one morning, his face pale and serious. She knew the moment her eyes
fell upon him that he had come to tell her something, and what it was he had to tell.

This is an atom: 
"Margaret," said he, beginning to speak as soon as he had seated himself, "I have made up my
mind about that shaft.  It would be absolutely wicked if I were not to go down to the bottom
and see what is there.  I have discovered something--something wonderful --and I do not know
what it is.  I can form no ideas about it, there is nothing on which I can base any theory.
I have done my best to solve this problem without going down, but my telescope reveals nothing,
my camera shows me nothing at all."

This is an atom: 
She sat perfectly quiet, pallid and listening.

This is an atom: 
"I have thought over this thing by day and by night," he continued, "but the conclusion forces
itself upon me, steadily and irresistibly, that it is my duty to descend that shaft.  I have
carefully considered everything, positively everything, connected with the safety of such a
descent.  The air in the cavity where my shell now rests is perfectly good; I have tested it.
The temperature is simply warm, and there is no danger of quicksands or anything of that sort,
for my shell still rests as immovable as when I first saw it below the bottom of the shaft.

This is an atom: 
"As to the distance I should have to descend, when you come to consider it, it is nothing.
What is fourteen miles in a tunnel through a mountain?  Some of those on the Great Straightcut
Pacific Railroad are forty miles in length, and trains run backward and forward every day without
any one considering the danger; and yet there is really more danger from one of those tunnels
caving in than in my perpendicular shaft, where caving in is almost impossible.

This is an atom: 
"As to the danger which attends so great a descent, I have thoroughly provided against that.
In fact, I do not see, if I carry out my plans, how there could be any danger, more than constantly
surrounds us, no matter what we are doing.  In the first place, we should not think of that
great depth.  If a man fell down any one of the deep shafts in our silver mines, he would be
as thoroughly deprived of life as if he should fall down my shaft.  But to fall down mine--and
I want you to consider this, Margaret, and thoroughly understand it--would be almost impossible.
I have planned out all the machinery and appliances which would be necessary, and I want to
describe them to you, and then, I am sure, you will see for yourself that the element of danger
is more fully eliminated than if I should row you on the lake in a little boat."

This is an atom: 
She sat quiet, still pale, still listening, her eyes fixed upon him.

This is an atom: 
"I have devised a car," he said, "in which I can sit comfortably and smoke my cigar while I
make the descent.  This, at the easy and steady rate at which my engines would move, would
occupy less than three hours.  I could go a good deal faster if I wanted to, but this would
be fast enough.  Think of that--fourteen miles in three hours!  It would be considered very
slow and easy travelling on the surface of the earth.  This car would be suspended by a double
chain of the very best toughened steel, which would be strong enough to hold ten cars the weight
of mine. The windlass would be moved by an electric engine of sufficient power to do twenty
times the work I should require of it, but in order to make everything what might be called
super-safe, there would be attached to the car another double chain, similar to the first,
and this would be wound upon another windlass and worked by another engine, as powerful as
the first one.  Thus, even if one of these double chains should break--an accident almost impossible--or
if anything should happen to one of these engines, there would be another engine more than
sufficient for the work. The top of this car would be conical, ending in a sharp point, and
made of steel, so that if any fragment in the wall of the tunnel should become dislodged and
fall, it would glance from this roof and fall between the side of the car and the inner surface
of the shaft; for the car is to be only twenty-six inches in diameter-quite wide enough for
my purpose--and this would leave at least ten inches of space all around the car.  But, as
I have said before, the sides of this tunnel are hard and smooth.  The substances of which
they are composed have been pressed together by a tremendous force.  It is as unlikely that
anything should fall from them as that particles should drop from the inside of a rifle-barrel.

This is an atom: 
"I admit, Margaret, that this proposed journey into the depths of the earth is a very peculiar
one, but, after all, it is comparatively an easy and safe performance when compared to other
things that men have done.  The mountain-climbers of our fathers' time, who used to ascend
the highest peaks with nothing but spiked shoes and sharpened poles, ran far more danger than
would be met by one who would descend such a shaft as mine.

This is an atom: 
"And then, Margaret, think of what our friends on board the Dipsey have been and are doing!
Think of the hundreds of miles they have travelled through the unknown depths of the sea! 
Their expedition was fifty times as hazardous as the trip of a few hours which I propose."

This is an atom: 
Now Margaret spoke.

This is an atom: 
"But I am not engaged to be married to Samuel Block, or to Mr. Gibbs, or to any of the rest
of them."

This is an atom: 
He drew his chair closer to her, and he took both of her hands in his own.  He held them as
if they had been two lifeless things.

This is an atom: 
"Margaret," he said, "you know I love you, and--"

This is an atom: 
"Yes," she interrupted, "but I know that you love science more."

This is an atom: 
"Not at all," said he, "and I am going to show you how greatly mistaken you are.  Tell me not
to go down that shaft, tell me to live on without ever knowing what it is I have discovered,
tell me to explode bombs in that great hole until I have blocked it up, and I will obey you.
That is how I love you, Margaret."

This is an atom: 
She gazed into his eyes, and her hands, from merely lifeless things, became infused with a
gentle warmth; they moved as if they might return the clasp in which they were held.  But she
did not speak, she simply looked at him, and he patiently waited. Suddenly she rose to her
feet, withdrawing her hands from his hold as if he had hurt her.

This is an atom: 
"Roland," she exclaimed, "you think you know all that is in my heart, but you do not.  You
know it is filled with dread, with horror, with a sickening fear, but it holds more than that.
It holds a love for you which is stronger than any fear or horror or dread.  Roland, you must
go down that shaft, you must know the great discovery you have made--even if you should never
be able to come back to earth again, you must die knowing what it is. That is how I love you!"

This is an atom: 
Roland quickly made a step forward, but she moved back as if she were about to seat herself
again, but suddenly her knees bent beneath her, and, before he could touch her, she had fallen
over on her side and lay senseless on the floor.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXI

This is an atom: 
THE CAVE OF LIGHT

This is an atom: 
Margaret was put into the charge of her faithful house-keeper, and Roland did not see her again
until the evening.  As she met him she began immediately to talk upon some unimportant subject,
and there was that in her face which told him that it was her desire that the great thought
which filled both their minds should not be the subject of their conversation.  She told him
she was going to the sea-shore for a short time; she needed a change, and she would go the
next day.  He understood her perfectly, and they discussed various matters of business connected
with the Works.  She said nothing about the time of her return, and he did not allude to it.

This is an atom: 
On the day that Margaret left Sardis, Roland began his preparations for descending the shaft.
He had so thoroughly considered the machinery and appliances necessary for the undertaking,
and had worked out all his plans in such detail, in his mind and upon paper, that he knew exactly
what he wanted to do.  His orders for the great length of chain exhausted the stock of several
manufactories, and the engines he obtained were even more powerful than he had intended them
to be; but these he could procure immediately, and for smaller ones he would have been obliged
to wait.

This is an atom: 
The circular car which was intended to move up and down the shaft, and the peculiar machinery
connected with it, with the hoisting apparatus, were all made in his Works.  His skilled artisans
labored steadily day and night.

This is an atom: 
It was ten days before he was ready to make his descent. Margaret was still at the sea-shore.
They had written to each other frequently, but neither had made mention of the great shaft.
Even when he was ready to go down he said nothing to any one of any immediate intention of
descending.  There was a massive door which covered the mouth of the pit; this he ordered locked
and went away.

This is an atom: 
The next morning he walked into the building a little earlier than was his custom, called for
the engineers, and for Mr. Bryce, who was to take charge of everything connected with the descent,
and announced that he was going down as soon as preparations could be made.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Bryce and the men who were to assist him were very serious. They said nothing that was
not necessary.  If their employer had been any other man than Roland Clewe it is possible they
might have remonstrated with him.  But they knew him, and they said and did nothing more than
was their duty.

This is an atom: 
The door of the shaft was removed, the car which had hung high above it was lowered to the
mouth of the opening, and Roland stepped within it and seated himself.  Above him and around
him were placed geological tools and instruments of many kinds; a lantern, food and drink;
everything, in fact, which he could possibly be presumed to need upon this extraordinary journey.
A telephone was at his side by which he could communicate at any time with the surface of the
earth.  There were electric bells; there was everything to make his expedition safe and profitable.
When he gave the word to start the engines, there were no ceremonies, and nothing was said
out of the common.

This is an atom: 
When the conical top of the car had descended below the surface, a steel grating, with orifices
for the passage of the chains, was let down over the mouth of the shaft, and the downward journey
was begun.  In the floor of the car were grated openings, through which Clewe could look downward;
but although the shaft below him was brilliantly illuminated by electric lights placed under
the car, it did not frighten him or make him dizzy to look down, for the aperture did not appear
to be very far below him.  The upper part of the car was partially open, and bright lights
shone upon the sides of the shaft.

This is an atom: 
As he slowly descended, he could see the various strata appearing and disappearing in the order
in which he knew them.  Not far below the surface he passed cavities which he believed held
water; but there was no water in them now.  He had expected these, and had feared that upon
their edges there might be loosened patches of rock or soil, but everything seemed tightly
packed and hard.  If anything had been loosened it had gone down already.

This is an atom: 
Down, down he went until he came to the eternal rocks, where the inside of the shaft was polished
as if it had been made of glass. It became warmer and warmer, but he knew that the heat would
soon decrease.  The character of the rocks changed, and he studied them as he went down, and
continually made notes.

This is an atom: 
After a time the polished rocky sides of the shaft grew to be of a solemn sameness.  Clewe
ceased to take notes; he lighted a cigar and smoked.  He tried to quietly imagine what he would
come to when he got to the bottom; it would be some sort of a cave into which his shell had
made an opening.  He wondered what sort of a cave it would be, and how high the roof of it
was from the bottom.  He wondered if his gardener had remembered what he had told him about
the flower-beds in front of his house; he wanted certain changes made which Margaret had suggested.
He tried to keep his mind on the flower-beds, but it drifted away to the cave below.  He began
to wonder if he would come to some underground body of water where he would be drowned; but
he knew that was a silly thought.  If the shaft had gone through subterranean reservoirs, the
water of these would have run out, and before they reached the bottom of the shaft would have
dissipated into mist.

This is an atom: 
Down, down he went.  He looked at his watch; he had been in that car only an hour and a half.
Was that possible?  He had supposed he was almost at the bottom.  Suddenly he thought of the
people above, and of the telephone.  Why had not some of them spoken to him?  It was shameful!
He instantly called Bryce, and his heart leaped with joy when he heard the familiar voice in
his ear.  Now he talked steadily on for more than an hour.  He had his gardener called, and
he told him all that he wanted done in the flower-beds. He gave many directions in regard to
the various operations of the Works.  Things had been put back a great deal of late.  He hoped
soon to have everything going on in the ordinary way. There were two or three inventions in
which he took particular interest, and of these he talked at great length with Mr. Bryce. Suddenly,
in the midst of some talk about hollow steel rods, he told Bryce to let the engines move faster;
there was no reason why the car should go so slowly.

This is an atom: 
The windlasses moved with a little more rapidity, and Clewe now turned and looked at an indicator
which was placed on the side of the car, a little over his head.  This instrument showed the
depth to which he had descended, but he had not looked at it before, for if there should be
anything which would make him nervous it would be the continual consideration of the depth
to which he had descended.

This is an atom: 
The indicator showed that he had gone down fourteen and one eighth miles.  Clewe turned and
sat stiffly in his seat.  He glanced down and saw beneath him only an illuminated hole, fading
away at the bottom.  Then he turned to speak to Bryce, but to his surprise he could think of
nothing to say.  After that he lighted another cigar and sat quietly.

This is an atom: 
Some minutes passed--he did not know how many--and he looked down through the gratings at the
floor of the car.  The electric light streamed downward through a deep orifice, which did not
fade away and end in nothing; it ended in something dark and glittering. Then, as he came nearer
and nearer to this glittering thing, he saw that it was his automatic shell, lying on its side,
but he could see only a part of it through the opening of the bottom of the shaft which he
was descending.  In an instant, as it seemed to him, the car emerged from the narrow shaft,
and he seemed to be hanging in the air-at least there was nothing he could see except that
great shell, lying some forty feet below him.  But it was impossible that the shell should
be lying on the air!  He rang to stop the car.

This is an atom: 
"Anything the matter?" cried Bryce, almost at the same instant.

This is an atom: 
"Nothing at all," Clewe replied.  "It's all right, I am near the bottom."

This is an atom: 
In a state of the highest nervous excitement, Clewe gazed about him.  He was no longer in a
shaft; but where was he?  Look out on what side he would, he saw nothing but the light going
out from his lamps, but which seemed to extend indefinitely all about him. There seemed to
be no limit to his vision in any direction.  Then he leaned over the side of his car and looked
downward.  There was the great shell directly under him, but under it and around it, extending
as far beneath it as it extended in every other direction, was the light from his own lamps,
and yet that great shell, weighing many tons, lay as if it rested upon the solid ground!

This is an atom: 
After a few moments Clewe shut his eyes; they pained him. Something seemed to be coming into
them like a fine frost in a winter wind.  Then he called to Bryce to let the car descend very
slowly.  It went down, down, gradually approaching the great shell.  When the bottom of the
car was within two feet of it, Clewe rang to stop.  In short, with us, the infinity of details
overlays the simplicity and grandeur of our public deliberations.

This is an atom: 
Such was the advantage--a mighty advantage--for Greece.

This is an atom: 
Now, finally, for the use made of this advantage. To that point I have already spoken. By
the clamorous and undeliberative qualities of the Athenian political audience, by its fitful
impatience, and vehement arrogance, and fervid partisanship, all wide and general discussion
was barred _in limine_.

This is an atom: 
And thus occurred this singular inversion of positions--the greatest of Greek orators was
obliged to treat these Catholic questions as mere Athenian questions
of business.

This is an atom: 
On the other hand, the least eloquent of British senators, whether from the immense advance in
knowledge, or from the custom and usage of Parliament, seldom fails, more or less, to elevate his
intense details of pure technical business into something dignified, either by the necessities
of pursuing the _historical_ relations of the matter in discussion, or of arguing its merits as a
case of general finance, or as connected with general political economy, or, perhaps, in its
bearings on peace or war.

This is an atom: 
The Grecian was forced, by the composition of his headstrong auditory, to degrade and
personalise his grand themes; the Englishman is forced, by the difference of his audience, by
old prescription, and by the opposition of a well-informed, hostile party, into elevating his
merely technical and petty themes into great national questions, involving honour and benefit
to tens of millions.

This is an atom: 
THE GERMAN LANGUAGE, AND PHILOSOPHY OF KANT.

This is an atom: 
Using a New Testament, of which (in the narrative parts at least) any one word being given will
suggest most of what is immediately consecutive, you evade the
most irksome of the penalties annexed to the first breaking ground
in a new language: you evade the necessity of hunting up and down
a dictionary.

This is an atom: 
Your own memory, and the inevitable suggestions of the context, furnish a dictionary _pro
hac vice_. And afterwards, upon advancing to other books, where you are obliged to forego such
aids, and to swim without corks, you find yourself already in possession of the particles
for expressing addition, succession, exception, inference--in short, of all the forms by
which transition or connection is effected (_if_, _but_, _and_,
_therefore_, _however_, _notwithstanding_), together with all those
adverbs for modifying or restraining the extent of a subject or a
predicate, which in all languages alike compose the essential
frame-work or _extra-linear_ machinery of human thought.

This is an atom: 
The filling-up--the _matter_ (in a scholastic sense)--may differ infinitely; but the _form_, the
periphery, the determining moulds into which this matter is fused--all this is the same for
ever: and so wonderfully limited in its extent is this frame-work,
so narrow and rapidly revolving is the clock-work of connections
among human thoughts, that a dozen pages of almost any book suffice
to exhaust all the [Greek: epea pteroenta][20] which express them.

This is an atom: 
To have mastered these [Greek: epea pteroenta] is in effect to have mastered seven-tenths, at the
least, of any language; and the benefit of using a New Testament,
or the familiar parts of an Old Testament, in this preliminary
drill, is, that your own memory is thus made to operate as a perpetual
dictionary or nomenclator.

This is an atom: 
I have heard Mr.
Southey say that, by carrying in his pocket a Dutch, Swedish, or
other Testament, on occasion of a long journey performed in '_muggy_'
weather, and in the inside of some venerable 'old heavy'--such as
used to bestow their tediousness upon our respectable fathers some
thirty or forty years ago--he had more than once turned to so
valuable an account the doziness or the dulness of his fellow-travellers,
that whereas he had 'booked' himself at the coach-office utterly
[Greek: analphabÃªtos], unacquainted with the first rudiments of the
given language, he had made his parting bows to his coach brethren
(secretly returning thanks to them for their stupidity), in a
condition for grappling with any common book in that dialect.

This is an atom: 
One of the polyglot Old or New Testaments published by Bagster, would be a perfect EncyclopÃ¦dia,
or _Panorganon_, for such a scheme of coach discipline, upon dull
roads and in dull company.

This is an atom: 
As respects the German language in particular, I shall give one
caution from my own experience, to the self-instructor:
it is a caution which applies to the German language exclusively,
or to that more than to any other, because the embarrassment which
it is meant to meet, grows out of a defect of taste characteristic
of the German mind.

This is an atom: 
It is this: elsewhere, you would naturally, as a beginner, resort to _prose_ authors, since
the license and audacity of poetic thinking, and the large freedom of a poetic treatment,
cannot fail to superadd difficulties of individual creation to the general difficulties of a strange
dialect.

This is an atom: 
But this rule, good for every other case, is _not_ good for the
literature of Germany.

This is an atom: 
Difficulties there certainly are, and perhaps in more than the usual
proportion, from the German peculiarities of poetic treatment; but
even these are overbalanced in the result, by the single advantage
of being limited in the extent by the metre, or (as it may happen)
by the particular stanza.

This is an atom: 
To German poetry there is a known, fixed, calculable limit. Infinity, absolute infinity, is
impracticable in any German metre.
Not so with German prose. Style, in any sense, is an inconceivable idea to a German
intellect.
Take the word in the limited sense of what the Greeks called [Greek: Synthesis onomatÃ´n]--_i.

This is an atom: 
e._ the construction of sentences--I affirm that a German (unless it were here and there a
Lessing) cannot admit such an idea. Books there are in German, and, in other respects, very good
books too, which consist of one or two enormous sentences. A German sentence describes an
arch between the rising and the setting sun. Take Kant for illustration: he has actually been
complimented by the cloud-spinner, Frederic Schlegel, who is now in Hades, as a most original
artist in the matter of style. 'Original' Heaven knows he was! His idea of a sentence was as
follows:--We have all seen, or read of, an old family coach, and
the process of packing it for a journey to London some seventy or
eighty years ago.

This is an atom: 
Night and day, for a week at least, sate the housekeeper, the lady's
maid, the butler, the gentleman's gentleman, &c., packing the huge
ark in all its recesses, its 'imperials,' its 'wills,' its 'Salisbury
boots,' its 'sword-cases,' its front pockets, side pockets, rear
pockets, its 'hammer-cloth cellars' (which a lady explains to me
as a corruption from _hamper-cloth_, as originally a cloth for
hiding a hamper, stored with _viaticum_), until all the uses and
needs of man, and of human life, savage or civilised, were met with
separate provision by the infinite chaos.

This is an atom: 
Pretty nearly upon the model of such an old family coach packing, did Kant institute and pursue
the packing and stuffing of one of his regular sentences. Everything that could ever be needed
in the way of explanation, illustration, restraint, inference,
by-clause, or indirect comment, was to be crammed, according to
this German philosopher's taste, into the front pockets, side
pockets, or rear pockets, of the one original sentence.

This is an atom: 
Hence it is that a sentence will last in reading whilst a man
'Might reap an acre of his neighbour's corn.'

This is an atom: 
Nor is this any peculiarity of Kant's. It is common to the whole family of prose writers of
Germany, unless when they happen to have studied French models,
who cultivate the opposite extreme.

This is an atom: 
As a caution, therefore, practically applied to this particular
anomaly in German prose-writing, I advise all beginners to choose
between two classes of composition--ballad poetry, or comedy--as
their earliest school of exercise; ballad poetry, because the form
of the stanza (usually a quatrain) prescribes a very narrow range
to the sentences; comedy, because the form of dialogue, and the
imitation of daily life in its ordinary tone of conversation, and
the spirit of comedy naturally suggesting a brisk interchange of
speech, all tend to short sentences.

This is an atom: 
These rules I soon drew from my own experience and observation.

This is an atom: 
And the one sole purpose towards which I either sought or wished for aid, respected the
pronunciation; not so much for attaining a just one (which I was satisfied could not be
realised out of Germany, or, at least, out of a daily intercourse with Germans) as for preventing
the formation, unawares, of a radically false one.

This is an atom: 
The guttural and palatine sounds of the _ch_, and some other German peculiarities, cannot
be acquired without constant practice.

This is an atom: 
But the false Westphalian or Jewish pronunciation of the vowels,
diphthongs, &c., may easily be forestalled, though the true delicacy
of Meissen should happen to be missed.

This is an atom: 
Thus much guidance I purchased, with a very few guineas, from my young Dresden tutor, who
was most anxious for permission to extend his assistance; but this I would not hear of:
and, in the spirit of fierce (perhaps foolish) independence, which governed most of my actions
at that time of life, I did all the rest for myself.

This is an atom: 
'It was a banner broad unfurl'd, The picture of that western world.'
These, or words like these, in which Wordsworth conveys the sudden
apocalypse, as by an apparition, to an ardent and sympathising
spirit, of the stupendous world of America, rising, at once, like
an exhalation, with all its shadowy forests, its endless savannas,
and its pomp of solitary waters--well and truly might I have applied
to my first launching upon that vast billowy ocean of the German
literature.

This is an atom: 
As a past literature, as a literature of inheritance and tradition, the German was nothing.
Ancestral titles it had none; or none comparable to those of
England, Spain, or even Italy; and there, also, it resembled America,
as contrasted with the ancient world of Asia, Europe, and North
Africa.[21] But, if its inheritance were nothing, its prospects,
and the scale of its present development, were in the amplest style
of American grandeur.

This is an atom: 
_Ten thousand_ new books, we are assured by Menzel, an author of high reputation--a _literal
myriad_--is considerably below the number annually poured from all quarters of Germany,
into the vast reservoir of Leipsic; spawn infinite, no doubt, of crazy dotage, of dreaming
imbecility, of wickedness, of frenzy, through every phasis of Babylonian confusion; yet, also,
teeming and heaving with life and the instincts of truth--of truth hunting and chasing in
the broad daylight, or of truth groping in the chambers of darkness; sometimes seen as it displays
its cornucopia of tropical fruitage; sometimes heard dimly, and in promise, working its way
through diamond mines.
Not the tropics, not the ocean, not life itself, is such a type of variety, of infinite forms,
or of creative power, as the German literature, in its recent motions (say for the last
twenty years), gathering, like the Danube, a fresh volume of power
at every stage of its advance.

This is an atom: 
A banner it was, indeed, to me of miraculous promise, and suddenly
unfurled.

This is an atom: 
It seemed, in those days, an El Dorado as true and undeceiving as it was evidently inexhaustible.
And the central object in this interminable wilderness of what then seemed imperishable bloom and
verdure--the very tree of knowledge in the midst of this Eden--was the new or transcendental
philosophy of Immanuel Kant.

This is an atom: 
[Footnote 20: [Greek: Epea pteroenta], literally _winged words_.

This is an atom: 
To explain the use and origin of this phrase to non-classical
readers, it must be understood that, originally, it was used by
Homer to express the few, rapid, and significant words which conveyed
some hasty order, counsel, or notice, suited to any sudden occasion
or emergency: _e. g._ 'To him flying from the field the hero addressed
these winged words--"Stop, coward, or I will transfix thee with my
spear."'

This is an atom: 
But by Horne Tooke, the phrase was adopted on the title-page of his
_Diversions of Purley_, as a pleasant symbolic expression for all
the non-significant particles, the _articuli_ or joints of language,
which in his well-known theory are resolved into abbreviations or
compendious forms (and therefore rapid, flying, _winged_ forms),
substituted for significant forms of greater length.

This is an atom: 
Thus, _if_ is a non-significant particle, but it is an abbreviated form of an imperative in the
second person--substituted for gif, or give, or grant the case--put the case that. All other
particles are shown by Horne Tooke to be equally shorthand (or
_winged_) substitutions.]

This is an atom: 
[Footnote 21: It has been rather too much forgotten, that Africa,
from the northern margin of Bilidulgerid and the Great Desert,
southwards--everywhere, in short, beyond Egypt, Cyrene, and the
modern Barbary States--belongs, as much as America, to the New
World--the world unknown to the ancients.]

This is an atom: 
I have described the gorgeousness of my expectations in those early days of my prelusive acquaintance
with German literature. I have a little lingered in painting that glad aurora of my first
pilgrimage to the fountains of the Rhine and of the Danube, in order adequately to shadow out the
gloom and blight which soon afterwards settled upon the hopes of that golden dawn. In Kant, I
had been taught to believe, were the keys of a new and a creative
philosophy.

This is an atom: 
Either '_ejus ductu_,' or '_ejus auspiciis_'--that is, either
directly under his guidance, or indirectly under any influence
remotely derived from his principles--I looked confidingly to see
the great vistas and avenues of truth laid open to the philosophic
inquirer.

This is an atom: 
Alas! all was a dream. Six weeks' study was sufficient to close my hopes in that quarter for
ever. The philosophy of Kant--so famous, so commanding in Germany, from about the period of
the French Revolution--already, in 1805, I had found to be a philosophy of destruction, and
scarcely, in any one chapter, so much as _tending_ to a philosophy
of reconstruction.

This is an atom: 
It destroys by wholesale, and it substitutes nothing. Perhaps, in the whole history of man, it
is an unexampled case, that such a scheme of speculation--which offers nothing seducing to
human aspirations, nothing splendid to the human imagination,
nothing even positive and affirmative to the human understanding--should
have been able to found an interest so broad and deep among thirty-five
millions of cultivated men.

This is an atom: 
The English reader who supposes this interest to have been confined to academic bowers, or the
halls of philosophic societies, is most inadequately alive to the case. Sects, heresies,
schisms, by hundreds, have arisen out of this philosophy--many thousands of books have been
written by way of teaching it, discussing it, extending it, opposing it. And yet it is a
fact, that all its doctrines are negative--teaching, in no case, what we _are_, but simply
what we are _not_ to believe--and that all its truths are barren.

This is an atom: 
Such being its unpopular character, I cannot but imagine that the German people have received
it with so much ardour, from profound incomprehension of its
meaning, and utter blindness to its drift--a solution which may
seem extravagant, but is not so; for, even amongst those who have
expressly commented on this philosophy, not one of the many hundreds
whom I have myself read, but has retracted from every attempt to
explain its dark places.

This is an atom: 
At last Sammy
took her by the arm and told her she must go below, for they were going to close up the hatchways.

This is an atom: 
"Well," said Sarah, with a sigh, "I suppose I must give 'em up; they were the warmest and most
comfortable ones I had, and I could have thawed 'em out and dried 'em so that they would have
been as good as ever.  I would not mind leavin' 'em if there was a human bein' in this neighborhood
that would wear 'em; but there ain't, and it ain't likely there ever will be, and if they are
frozen stiff in the ice somewhere, they may stay here, as good as new, for countless ages!"

This is an atom: 
Of course everybody was very happy, now that they were returning homeward from a voyage successful
beyond parallel in history, and even Rovinski was beginning to assume an air of gratified anticipation.
He had been released from his confinement and allowed to attend to his duties, but the trust
which had been placed in him when this kindness had been extended to him on a previous occasion
was wanting now.  Everybody knew that he was an unprincipled man, and that if he could gain
access to the telegraph instrument at Cape Tariff he would make trouble for the real discoverer
of the north pole; so it was agreed among the officers of the vessel that the strictest watch
must be kept on him and no shore privileges be allowed him.

This is an atom: 
The southward voyage of the Dipsey was an easy one and without notable incident; and at last
a lookout who had been posted at the upper skylight reported light from above.  This meant
that they had reached open water southward of the frozen regions they had been exploring, and
the great submarine voyage, the most peculiar ever made by man, was ended.  Captain Jim Hubbell
immediately put on a heavy pea-jacket with silver buttons, for as soon as the vessel should
sail upon the surface of the sea he would be in command.

This is an atom: 
When the dripping Dipsey rose from the waters of the arctic regions, it might have been supposed
that the people on board of her were emerging into a part of the world where they felt perfectly
at home. Cape Tariff, to which they were bound, was a hundred miles away, and was itself a
lonely spot, often inaccessible in severe weather, and they must make a long and hazardous
voyage from it before they could reach their homes; but by comparison with the absolutely desolate
and mysterious region they had left, any part of the world where there was a possibility of
meeting with other human beings seemed familiar and homelike.

This is an atom: 
But when the Dipsey was again upon the surface of the ocean, when the light of day was shining
unobstructed upon the bold form of Captain Hubbell as he strode upon the upper deck--being
careful not to stand still lest his shoes should freeze fast to the planks beneath him--the
party on board were not so-well satisfied as they expected to be.  There was a great wind blowing,
and the waves were rolling high.  Not far away, on their starboard bow, a small iceberg, tossing
like a disabled ship, was surging towards them, impelled by a biting blast from the east, and
the sea was so high that sometimes the spray swept over the deck of the vessel, making it impossible
for Captain Hubbell and the others with him to keep dry.

This is an atom: 
Still the captain kept his post and roared out his orders, still the Dipsey pressed forward
against wind and wave.  Her engines were strong, her electric gills were folded close to her
sides, and she seemed to feel herself able to contend against the storm, and in this point
she was heartily seconded by her captain.

This is an atom: 
But the other people on board soon began to have ideas of a different kind.  It seemed to all
of them, including the officers, that this vessel, not built to encounter very heavy weather,
was in danger, and even if she should be able to successfully ride out the storm, their situation
must continue to be a very unpleasant one.  The Dipsey pitched and tossed and rolled and shook
herself, and it was the general opinion, below decks, that the best thing for her to do would
be to sink into the quiet depths below the surface, where she was perfectly at home, and proceed
on her voyage to Cape Tariff in the submarine fashion to which she was accustomed.

This is an atom: 
It was some time before Captain Hubbell would consent to listen to such a proposition as this,
but when a wave, carrying on its crest a lump of ice about the size of a flour barrel, threw
its burden on the deck of the vessel, raking it from stem to stern, the captain, who had barely
been missed by the grating missile, agreed that in a vessel with such a low rail and of such
defective naval principles, it would be better perhaps to sail under the water than on top
of it, and so he went below, took off his pea-jacket with the silver buttons, and retired into
private life.  The Dipsey then sank to a quiet depth and continued her course under water,
to the great satisfaction of everybody on board.

This is an atom: 
On a fine, frosty morning, with a strong wind blowing, although the storm had subsided, the
few inhabitants of the little settlement at Cape Tariff saw in the distance a flag floating
over the water.  The Dipsey had risen to the surface some twenty miles from the Cape and now
came bravely on, Captain Hubbell on deck, his silver buttons shining in the sun.  The sea was
rough, but everybody was willing to bear with a little discomfort in order to be able to see
the point of land which was the end of the voyage on the Dipsey, to let their eyes rest as
early as possible upon a wreath of smoke arising from the habitation of human beings, and to
catch sight of those human beings themselves.

This is an atom: 
As soon as the Dipscy arrived in the harbor, Sammy and most of the officers went on shore to
open communication with Sardis. Sarah Block stayed on the vessel.  She had been on shore when
she had arrived at Cape Tariff in the Go Lightly, and her disgust with the methods of living
in that part of the world had been freely expressed.  So long as she had perfectly comfortable
quarters on board the good ship she did not wish to visit the low huts and extremely close
quarters in which dwelt the people of the little colony.  Rovinski also remained on board,
but not because he wanted to do so.  A watch was kept upon him; but as the Dipsey was anchored
some distance from the landing-place, Mr. Marcy was of the opinion that if he attempted to
swim ashore it might be well to let him do so, for if he should not be benumbed in the water
into which he would plunge he would certainly be frozen to death as soon as he reached the shore.

This is an atom: 
The messages which came from Sardis as soon as news had been received of the safe return of
the explorers were full of hearty congratulations and friendly welcome, but they were not very
long, and Sammy said to Mr. Gibbs that he thought it likely that this was one of Mr. Clewe's
busy times.  The latter telegraphed that he would send a vessel for them immediately, and as
she was now lying at St. John's they would not have to wait very long.

This is an atom: 
The fact was that the news of the arrival of the Dipsey at Cape Tariff had come to Sardis a
week after Clewe's descent into the shaft, and he was absorbed, body and soul, in his underground
discoveries.  He was not wanting in sympathy, or even affection, for the people who had been
doing his work, and his interest in their welfare and their achievements was as great as it
ever had been, but the ideas and thoughts which now occupied his mind were of a character which
lessened and overshadowed every other object of consideration.  Most of the messages sent to
Cape Tariff had come from Margaret Raleigh.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXIV

This is an atom: 
ROVINSKI COMES TO THE SURFACE

This is an atom: 
When Sammy Block and his companion explorers had journeyed from Cape Tariff to Sardis, they
found Roland Clewe ready to tender a most grateful welcome, and to give full and most interested
attention to the stories of their adventures and to their scientific reports.  For a time he
was willing to allow his own great discovery to lie fallow in his mind, and to give his whole
attention to the wonderful achievement which had been made under his direction.

This is an atom: 
He had worked out his theory of the formation and present constitution of the earth; had written
a full and complete report of what he had seen and done, and was ready, when he thought the
proper time had arrived, to announce to the world his theories and his facts.  Moreover, he
had sent to several jewelers and mineralogists some of the smaller fragments which he had picked
up in the cave of light, and these specialists, while reporting the material of the specimens
purest diamond, expressed the greatest surprise at their shape and brilliancy.  They had evidently
not been ground or cut, and yet their sharp points and glittering surfaces reflected light
as if they had been in the hands of a diamond-cutter.  One of these experts wrote to Clewe
asking him if he had been digging diamonds with a machine which broke the gems to pieces.

This is an atom: 
So the soul of Roland Clewe was satisfied; it seemed to walk the air as he himself once had
trod what seemed to him a solid atmosphere.  There was now nothing that his ambition might
point out which would induce him to endeavor to climb higher in the field of human achievement
than the spot on which he stood.  From this great elevation he was perfectly willing to look
down and kindly consider the heroic performances of those who had reached the pole, and who
had anchored a buoy on the extreme northern point of the earth's axis.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Gibbs's reports, and those of his assistants, were well worked out, and of the greatest
value to the scientific world, and every one who had made that memorable voyage on the Dipscy
had stories to tell for which editors in every civilized land would have paid gold beyond all
former precedent.

This is an atom: 
But Roland Clewe did not care to say anything to the world until he could say everything that
he wished to say.  It had been known that he had sent an expedition into Northern waters, but
exactly what he intended to do had not been known, and what he had done had not been communicated
even to the telegraph-operators at Cape Tariff.  These had received despatches in cipher from
points far away to the north, but while they transmitted them to Sardis they had no idea of
their signification.  When everything should be ready to satisfy the learned world, as well
as the popular mind, the great discovery of the pole would be announced.

This is an atom: 
In the meantime there was a suspicion in the journalistic world that the man of inventions
who lived at Sardis, New Jersey, had done something out of the common in the North.  A party
of people, one of them a woman, had been taken up there and left there, and they had recently
been brought back.  The general opinion was that Clewe had endeavored to found a settlement
at some point north of Cape Tariff, probably for purposes of scientific observation, and that
he had failed.  The stories of these people, however, would be interesting, and several reporters
made visits to Sardis.  But they all saw Sammy, and not one of them considered his communications
worth more than a brief paragraph.

This is an atom: 
In a week Mr. Gibbs would have finished his charts, his meteorological, his geological, and
geographical reports, and a clear, succinct account of the expedition, written by Clewe himself
from the statements of the party, would be ready for publication; and in the brilliantly lighted
sky of discovery which now rested, one edge upon Sardis and the other upon the pole, there
was but one single cloud, and this was Rovinski.

This is an atom: 
The ambitious and unscrupulous Pole had been the source of the greatest trouble and uneasiness
since he had left Cape Tariff. While there he had found that he could not possibly get ashore,
and so had kept quiet; but when on board the vessel which had been sent to them from St. John's,
he had soon begun to talk to the crew, and there seemed to be but one way of preventing him
from making known what had been done by the expedition before its promoters were ready for
the disclosure, and this was to declare him a maniac, whose utterances were of no value whatever.
He was put into close confinement, and it was freely reported that he had gone crazy while
in the arctic regions, and that his mind had been filled with all sorts of insane notions regarding
that part of the world.

This is an atom: 
It had been intended to put him in jail on a criminal charge, but this would not prevent him
from talking; and so, when he arrived in New Jersey, he was sent to an insane asylum, the officers
of which were not surprised to receive him, for, in their opinion, a wilder-looking maniac
was not, to be found within the walls of the institution.

This is an atom: 
Early on the morning of the day before the world was to be electrified by the announcement
of the discovery of the pole, a man named William Cunningham, employed in the Sardis Works,
entered the large building which had been devoted to the manufacture of the automatic shell,
but which had not been used of late and had been kept locked.  Cunningham was the watchman,
and had entered to make his usual morning rounds.  He had scarcely closed the door behind him
when, looking over towards the engines which still stood by the mouth of the shaft made by
the automatic shell, he was amazed to see that the car which had been used by Roland Clewe
in his descent was not hanging above them.

This is an atom: 
Utterly unable to understand this state of affairs, he ran to the mouth of the shaft.  He found
the great trap-door which had closed it thrown back, and the grating which had been made to
cover the orifice after the car had descended in its place.  The engines were not moving, and
the chain on the windlass of one of them appeared not to have been disturbed, but on the other
windlass one of the chains had been unwound.  Cunningham was so astonished that he could not
believe what he saw.  He had been there the night before; everything had been in order, the
shaft closed, and the trap-door locked.  He leaned over the grating and looked down; he could
see nothing but a black hole without any bottom.  The man did not look long, for it made him
dizzy.  He turned and ran out of the house to call Mr. Bryce.

This is an atom: 
Ivan Rovinski was not perhaps a lunatic, but his unprincipled ambition had made him so disregard
the principles of ordinary prudence when such principles stood in his way that it could not
be said that he was at all times entirely sane.  He understood thoroughly why he had been put
in an asylum, and it enraged him to think that by this course his enemies had obtained a great
advantage over him.  No matter what he might say, it was only necessary to point to the fact
that he was in a lunatic asylum, or that he had just come out of one, to make his utterances
of no value.

This is an atom: 
But to remain in confinement did not suit him at all, and, after three days' residence in the
institution in which he had been placed, he escaped and made his way to a piece of woods about
two miles from Sardis, where, early that year, he had built himself a rude shelter, from which
he might go forth at night and study, so far as he should be able, the operations in the Works
of Roland Clewe.  Having safely reached his retreat, he lost no time in sallying forth to spy
out what was going on at Sardis.

This is an atom: 
He was cunning and wary, and a man of infinite resource.  It was not long before he found out
that the polar discovery had not been announced, but he also discovered from listening to the
conversations of some of the workmen in the village, which he frequently visited in a guise
very unlike his ordinary appearance, that something extraordinary had taken place in the Sardis
Works, of which he had never heard.  A great shaft had been sunk, the people said, by accident;
Mr. Clewe had gone down it in a car, and it had taken him nearly three hours to get to the
bottom. Nobody yet knew what he had discovered, but it was supposed to be something very wonderful.

This is an atom: 
The night after Rovinski heard this surprising news he was in the building which had contained
the automatic shell.  As active as a cat, he had entered by an upper window.

This is an atom: 
Rovinski spent the night in that building.  He had with him a dark lantern, and he made the
most thorough examination of the machinery at the mouth of the shaft.  He was a man of great
mechanical ability and an expert in applied electricity.  He understood that machinery, with
all its complicated arrangements and appliances, as well as if he had built it himself.  In
fact, while examining it, he thought of some very valuable improvements which might have been
made in it.  He knew that it was an apparatus for lowering the car to a great depth, and, climbing
into the car, he examined everything it contained.  Coming down, he noticed the grating, and
he knew what it was for.  He looked over the engines and calculated the strength of the chains
on the windlasses.  He took an impression of the lock of the trap-door, and when he went away
in the very early hours of the morning he understood the apparatus which was intended to lower
the car as well as any person who had managed it.  He knew nothing about the shaft under the
great door, but this he intended to investigate as thoroughly as he had investigated the machinery.

This is an atom: 
The next night he entered the building very soon after Cunningham had gone his rounds, and
he immediately set to work to prepare for his descent into the shaft.  He disconnected one
of the engines, for he sneeringly said to himself that the other one was more than sufficient
to lower and raise the car.  He charged and arranged all the batteries and put in perfect working
order the mechanism by which Clewe had established a connection between the car and the engines,
using one of the chains as a conductor, so that he could himself check or start the engines
if an emergency should render it necessary.

This is an atom: 
Then Rovinski, bounding around like a wild animal in a cage, took out a key he had brought
with him, opened the trap-door, lifted it back, and gazed down.  He could see a beautifully
cut well, but that was all.  But no matter how deep it was, he intended to go down to the bottom
of it.

This is an atom: 
He started the engine and lowered the car to the ground.  Then he looked up at a grating which
hung above it and determined to make use of this protection.  He could not lower it in the
ordinary way after he had entered the car, but in fifteen minutes he had arranged a pulley
and rope by which, after the car had gone below the surface, he could lower the grating to
its place.  He got in, started down into the dark hole, stopped the engine, lowered the grating,
went down a little farther, and turned on the electric lights.

This is an atom: 
The descent of Rovinski was a succession of the wildest sensations of amazed delight.  Stratum
after stratum passed before his astonished eyes, and, when he had gone down low enough, he
allowed himself the most extravagant expressions of ecstasy.  His progress was not so regular
and steady as that of Roland Clewe had been.  He found that he had perfect control of the engine
and car, and sometimes he went down rapidly, sometimes slowly, and frequently he stopped. 
As he continued to descend, his amazement at the wonderful depth of the shaft became greater
and greater and his mind was totally unable to appreciate the situation.  Still he was not
frightened, and went on down.

This is an atom: 
At last Rovinski emerged into the cave of light.  There he stopped, the car hanging some twenty
or thirty feet above the bottom.  He looked out, he saw the shell, he saw the vast expanse
of lighted nothingness, he tried to imagine what it was that that mass of iron rested upon.
If he had not seen it, he would have thought he had come out into the upper air of some bottomless
cavern.  But a great iron machine nearly twenty feet long could not rest upon air!  He thought
he might be dreaming; he sat up and shut his eyes; in a few minutes he would open them and
see if he still saw the same incomprehensible things.

This is an atom: 
The downward passage of Rovinski had occupied a great deal more time than he had calculated
for.  He had stopped so much, and had been so careful to examine the walls of the shaft, that
morning had now arrived in the upper world, and it was at this moment, as he sat with his eyes
closed, that William Cunningham looked down into the mouth of the shaft.

This is an atom: 
Cunningham was an observing man, and that morning he had picked up a pin and stuck it in the
lapel of his rough coat, but he had done this hastily and carelessly.  The pin was of a recently
invented kind, being of a light, elastic metal, with its head of steel.  As Cunningham leaned
forward the pin slipped out of his coat; it fell through one of the openings in the grating,
and descended the shaft head downward.

This is an atom: 
For the first quarter of a mile the pin went swiftly in an absolutely perpendicular line, nearly
at the middle of the shaft.  For the next three-quarters of a mile it went down like a rifle-ball.
For the next five miles it sped on as if it had been a planet revolving in space.  Then, for
eight miles, this pin, falling perpendicularly through a greater distance than any object on
this earth had ever fallen perpendicularly, went downward with a velocity like that of light.
Its head struck the top of the car, which was hanging motionless in the cave of light; it did
not glance off, for its momentum was so great that it would glance from nothing.  It passed
through that steel roof; it passed through Rovinski's head, through his heart, down through
the car, and into the great shell which lay below.

This is an atom: 
When Mr. Bryce and several workmen came running back with William Cunningham, they were as
much surprised as he had been, and could form no theory to account for the disappearance of
the car.  It could not have slipped down accidentally and descended by its own weight, for
the trap-door was open and the grating was in place. They sent in great haste for Mr. Clewe,
and when he arrived he wasted no time in conjectures, but instantly ordered that the engine
which was attached to the car should be started and its chain wound up.

This is an atom: 
So great was the anxiety to get the car to the surface of the earth that the engine which raised
it was run at as high a speed as was deemed safe, and in a little more than an hour the car
came out of the mouth of the shaft, and in it sat Ivan Rovinski, motionless and dead.

This is an atom: 
No one who knew Rovinski wondered that he had had the courage to make the descent of the shaft,
and those who were acquainted with his great mechanical ability were not surprised that he
had been able to manage, by himself, the complicated machinery which would ordinarily require
the service of several men; but every one who saw him in the car, or after he had been taken
out of it, was amazed that he should be dead.  There was no sign of accident, no perceptible
wound, no appearance, in fact, of any cause why he should be a tranquil corpse and not an alert
and agile devil. Even when a post-mortem examination was made, the doctors were puzzled.  A
threadlike solution of continuity was discovered in certain parts of his body, but it was lost
in others, and the coroner's verdict was that he came to his death from unknown causes while
descending a shaft.  The general opinion was that in some way or other he had been frightened
to death.

This is an atom: 
This accident, much to Roland Clewe's chagrin, discovered to the public the existence of the
great shaft.  Whether or not he would announce its existence himself, or whether he would close
it up, had not been determined by Clewe; but when he and Margaret had talked over the matter
soon after the terrible incident, his mind was made up beyond all possibility of change, and,
by means of great bombs, the shaft was shattered and choked up for a depth of half a mile from
its mouth.  When this work was accomplished, nothing remained but a shallow well, and, when
this had been filled up with solid masonry, the place where the shaft had been was as substantial
as any solid ground.

This is an atom: 
Now the great discovery was probably shut out forever from the world, but Clewe was well satisfied.
He would never make another shaft, and it was not to be expected that men would plan and successfully
construct one which would reach down to the transparent nucleus of the earth.  The terrible
fate, whatever it was, which had overtaken Rovinski, should not, if Clewe could help it, overtake
any other human being.

This is an atom: 
"But my great discovery," said he to Margaret, "that remains as wonderful as the sun, and as
safe to look upon; for with my Artesian ray I can bore down to the solid centre of the earth,
and into it, and any man can study it with no more danger than if he sat in his armchair at
home; and if they doubt what I say about the material of which that solid centre is composed,
we can show them the fragments of it which I brought up with me."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXV

This is an atom: 
LAURELS

This is an atom: 
Nothing but a perusal of the newspapers, magazines, and scientific journals of the day could
give any idea of the enthusiastic interest which was shown all over the civilized world in
Roland Clewe's account of the discovery of the north pole.  His paper on the subject, which
was the first intimation the public had of the great news, was telegraphed to every part of
the world and translated into nearly every written language. Sardis became a Mecca for explorers
and scientific people at home and abroad, and honors of every kind were showered by geographical
and other learned societies upon Clewe and the brave company who had voyaged under the ice.

This is an atom: 
Each member of the party who had sailed on the Dipsey became a hero and spent most of those
days in according receptions to reporters, scholars, travellers, sportsmen, and as many of
the general public as could be accommodated.

This is an atom: 
Sarah Block received her numerous visitors in the parlor of the house which had been occupied
by Mr. Clewe (and which he had vacated in her favor the moment he had heard an intimation that
she would like to have it), in a beautiful gown made of the silky fibre from the pods of the
American milk-weed, then generally used in the manufacture of the finest fabrics.

This is an atom: 
Sarah fully appreciated her position as the woman who had visited the pole, a position not
only unique at the time, but which she believed would always remain so.  In every way she endeavored
to make her appearance suitable to her new position.  She wore the best clothes that her money
could buy, and furnished her new house very handsomely.  She discarded her old silver andirons
and fender, which required continual cleaning, and which would not have been tolerated by her
except that they were made of a metal which was now so cheap as to be used for household utensils,
and she put in their place a beautiful set of polished brass, such as people used in her mother's
time.  Whenever Sarah found any one whom she considered worthy to listen, she gave a very full
account of her adventures, never omitting the loss of her warm and comfortable shoes, which
misfortune, together with the performances of Rovinski, and all the dangers consequent, and
the acquaintance of the tame and lonely whale, she attributed to the fact that there were thirteen
people on board.

This is an atom: 
Sammy's accounts were in a more cheerful key, and his principles were not affected by his success.
He never had believed that there was any good in finding the pole, and he did not believe it
now.  When they got there, it was just like any other part of the ocean, and it required a
great deal of arithmetic and navigation to find out where it was, even when they were looking
at it; besides, as he had found out to his disgust, even when they had discovered it, it was
not the real pole to which the needle of the compass points.

This is an atom: 
Moreover, if there had been any distinctive mark about it, except the buoy which they had anchored
there, and even if it really were the pole to which needles should point, there was no particular
good in finding it, unless other people could get there.  But in regard to any other expedition
reaching the open polar sea under the ice, Sammy had grave doubts.  If a whale could not get
out of that sea there was every reason why nobody else should try to get into it; the Dipsey's
entrance was the barest scratch, and he would not try it again if the north pole were marked
out by a solid mountain of gold.

This is an atom: 
Roland Clewe refused in all personal interviews to receive the laudations offered him as the
discoverer of the pole.  It was true that the expedition had been planned by him, and all the
arrangements and mechanisms which had insured its success were of his invention, but he steadily
insisted that Mr. Gibbs and Sammy, as representatives of the party, should be awarded the glory
of the great discovery.

This is an atom: 
The remarkable success of this most remarkable expedition aroused a widespread spirit of arctic
exploration.  Not only were voyages under the ice discussed and planned, but there was a strong
feeling in favor of overland travel by means of the electric-motor sledges; and in England
and Norway expeditions were organized for the purpose of reaching the polar sea in this way.
It was noticed in most that was written and said upon this subject that one of the strongest
inducements for arctic expeditions was the fact that there would be found on the shores of
the polar sea a telegraph station, by means of which instantaneous news of success could be
transmitted.

This is an atom: 
The interest of sportsmen, especially of the hunters of big game, was greatly excited by the
statement that there was a whale in the polar sea.  These great creatures being extinct everywhere
else, it would be a unique and crowning glory to capture this last survivor of his race; and
there were many museums of natural history which were already discussing contracts with intending
polar whalers for the purchase of the skeleton of the last whale.

This is an atom: 
During all this time of enthusiasm and excitement, Roland Clewe made no reference, in any public
way, to his great discovery, which, in his opinion, far surpassed in importance to the world
all possible arctic discoveries.  He was busily engaged in increasing the penetrating distance
of his Artesian ray, and when the public mind should have sufficiently recovered from the perturbation
into which it had been thrown by the discovery of the pole, he intended to lay before it the
results of his researches into the depths of the earth.

This is an atom: 
At last the time arrived when he was ready for the announcement of the great achievement of
his life.  The machinery for the production of the Artesian ray had been removed to the larger
building which had contained the automatic shell, and was set up very near the place where
the mouth of the great shaft had been.

This is an atom: 
The lenses were arranged so that the path of the great ray should run down alongside of the
shaft and but a few feet from it.  The screen was set up as it had been in the other building,
and everything was made ready for the operations of the photic borer.

This is an atom: 
The address which Roland Clewe now delivered to the company was made as brief and as much to
the point as possible.  The description of the Artesian ray was listened to with the deepest
interest and with a vast amount of unexpressed incredulity.  What he subsequently said regarding
his automatic shell and its accidental descent through fourteen miles of the earth's crust,
excited more interest and more incredulity, not entirely unexpressed.  Clewe was well known
as a man of science, an inventor, an electrician of rare ability, and a person of serious purpose
and strict probity, but it was possible for a man of great attainments and of the highest moral
character to become a little twisted in his intellect.

This is an atom: 
When at last the speaker told of his descent into the shaft; of his passage fourteen miles
into the interior of the earth; of his discoveries, on which he based his theory that the centre
of our globe is one vast diamond, there was a general laugh from the reporters' quarter, and
the men of science began to move uneasily in their seats and to talk to each other.  Professor
Tippengray, her silver hair brushed smoothly back from her pale countenance, sat looking at
the speaker through her gold spectacles, as if the rays from her bright eyes would penetrate
into the very recesses of his soul.  Not an atom of doubt was in her mind; she never doubted,
she believed or she disbelieved.  At present she believed; she had come there to do that, and
she would wait, and when the proper time had come to disbelieve she would do so.

This is an atom: 
If there had been any disposition in the audience to considerately leave the man of shattered
intellect to the care of his friends, it disappeared when Clewe said that he would now be glad
to show to all present the workings of the Artesian ray. Crazy as he might be, they wanted
to wait and see what he had done.  The workmen who had charge of the machinery were on hand,
and in a few moments a circle of light was glowing on the ground within the screen.  Clewe
now announced that he would take those present, one at a time, inside the enclosure and show
them how light could be made to penetrate miles downward into the solid earth and rock.

This is an atom: 
Professor Tippengray was the first one invited to step within the screen.  Clewe stood at the
entrance ready to explain or to hand her the necessary telescopes; and as the portion of her
body which remained visible was between him and the light, there was nothing to disturb his nerves.

This is an atom: 
The lenses were so set that they could penetrate almost instantly to the depth which had previously
been reached, but Clewe made his ray move downward somewhat slowly; he did not wish, especially
to the first observer, to show everything at once.

This is an atom: 
As she beheld at her feet a great lighted well, extending downward beyond the reach of her
sharp eyes, Professor Tippengray stepped back with a scream which caused nearly everybody in
the audience to start to his feet.  Clewe expected this.  He raised his hand to the company,
asking them to keep still; then he handed Professor Tippengray a stick.

This is an atom: 
"Take this," he said, "and strike that disk of light; you will find it as solid ground as that
you stand on."  She did so.

This is an atom: 
"It is solid!" she gasped; "but where is the end of the stick?"

This is an atom: 
He turned off the light; there was the end of the stick, and there was the little patch of
sandy gravel, which he stepped upon, stamping heavily as he did so.  He then retired outside
the screen.  Professor Tippengray turned to the audience.

This is an atom: 
"It is all right, gentlemen," she said; "there is nothing to be afraid of.  I am going on with
the investigation."

This is an atom: 
Down, down, down went the light, and, telescope in hand, she stood close to the shining edge
of the apparent shaft.

This is an atom: 
"Presently," Clewe said, "you will see the end of the shaft which my Artesian ray is making;
then you will perceive a vast expanse of lighted nothingness; that is the great cleft in the
diamond which I described to you.  In this, apparently suspended in light, you will notice
the broken conical end of an enormous iron shell, the shell which made the real tunnel down
which I descended in the car."

This is an atom: 
At this she turned around and looked at him.  Even into her strong mind the sharp edge of distrust
began to insert itself.

This is an atom: 
"Look!" said he.

This is an atom: 
She looked through her telescope.  There was the cave of light; there was the shattered end
of the shell.

This is an atom: 
The hands which held the telescope began to tremble.  Quickly Clewe drew her away.

This is an atom: 
"Now," said he, "do you believe?"

This is an atom: 
For a few moments she could not speak, and then she whispered, "I believe that I have seen
what you have told me I should see."

This is an atom: 
Now succeeded a period of intense excitement, such as was perhaps never before known in an
assembly of scientific people.  One by one, each person was led by Clewe inside the screen
and shown the magical shaft of light.  Each received the revelation according to his nature.
Some were dumfounded and knew not what to think, others suspected all sorts of tricks, especially
with the telescopes, but a well-known optician, who by Clewe's request had brought a telescope
of his own, quickly disproved all suspicions of this kind.  Many could not help doubting what
they had seen, but it was impossible for them to formulate their doubts, with that wonderful
shaft of light still present to their mental visions.

This is an atom: 
For more than two hours Roland Clewe exhibited the action of his Artesian ray.  Then he called
the company to order.  He had shown them his shaft of light, and now he would give them some
facts in regard to the real shaft made by the automatic shell.

This is an atom: 
Every man who had been concerned in Mr. Clewe's descent into the shaft, and those who had assisted
in the sounding and the photographing, as well as the persons who had been present when Rovinski
was drawn up from its depths, now came forward and gave his testimony.  Clewe then exhibited
the photographs he had taken with his suspended camera, and to the geologists present these
were revelations of absorbing interest; seeing so much that they understood, it was difficult
to doubt what they saw and did not understand.

This is an atom: 
Now that what Clewe had just told them was substantiated by a number of witnesses, and now
that they had heard from these men that a plummet, a camera, and a car had been lowered fourteen
miles into the bowels of the earth, they had no reason to suppose that the great shaft had
existed only in the imagination of one crazy man, and they could not believe that all these
assistants and workmen were lunatics or liars.  Still they doubted.  Clewe could see that in
their faces as they intently listened to him.

This is an atom: 
"My friends," said he, "I have set before you nearly all the facts connected with my experience
in the shaft, but one important fact I have not yet mentioned.  I am quite sure that few, if
any of you, believe that I descended into the cleft of a great diamond lying beneath what we
call the crust of the earth. I will now state that before I left that cavity I picked up some
fragments of the material of which it is composed, which were splintered off when my shell
fell into it.  I will show you one of them."

This is an atom: 
A man brought a table covered with a blue cloth, and from one of his pockets Clewe drew a small
bag.  Opening this, he took out a diamond which he had brought up from the cave of light, and
placed it on the middle of the table.

This is an atom: 
"This," he said, "is a fragment of the mass of diamond into which I descended.  I have called
it 'The Great Stone of Sardis.'"

This is an atom: 
Nobody spoke, nobody seemed to breathe.  The huge diamond, of the form and size of a large
lemon, lay glowing upon the dark cloth, its irregular facets--all of them clean-cut and polished,
the results of fracture--absorbed and reflected the light, and a halo of subdued radiance surrounded
the great gem like a tender mist.

This is an atom: 
"I brought away a number of fragments of the diamond," said Clewe, his voice sounding as if
he spoke into an empty hall, "and some of them have been tested by two of the gentlemen present.
Here are the stones which have been tested."  And he laid some small pieces on the cloth. 
"They are of the same material as the large one.  I brought them all from what I believe to
be the great central core of the earth."

This is an atom: 
Everybody pressed forward, they surrounded the table.  One of the jewelers reverently took
up the great stone; then in his other hand he took one of the smaller fragments, which he instantly
recognized from its peculiar shape.  He looked from one to the other; presently he said:

This is an atom: 
"They are the same substances.  This is a diamond."  And he laid the great stone back upon
the cloth.

This is an atom: 
"Is there any other place on the surface of this earth, or is there any mine," inquired a shrill
voice from the company, "where one could get a diamond like that?"

This is an atom: 
"There is no such place known to mortal man," replied the jeweler.

This is an atom: 
_Titan_ was a half-crown monthly Magazine, a continuation in an enlarged form of _The
Instructor_.
I had become the acting Editor of its predecessor, _the New Series_ of _The Instructor_,
working in concert with my Father, the proprietor.The public excitement produced by the announcement of the discovery of the pole was a trifle
compared to that resulting from the news of the proceedings of that day.  Clewe's address,
with full accounts by the reporters, was printed everywhere, and it was not long before the
learned world had given itself up to the discussion.

This is an atom: 
From this controversy Roland Clewe kept himself aloof.  He had done all that he wanted to do,
he had shown all that he cared to show; now he would let other people investigate his facts
and his reasonings and argue about them; he would retire--he had done enough.

This is an atom: 
Professor Tippengray was one of the most enthusiastic defenders of Clewe's theories, and wrote
a great deal on the subject.

This is an atom: 
"Granted," she said, in one of her articles, "that the carboniferous minerals, of which the
diamond is one, are derived from vegetable matter, and that wood and plants must have existed
before the diamond, where, may I ask, did the prediamond-forests derive their carbon?  In what
form did it exist before they came into being?"

This is an atom: 
In another essay she said:

This is an atom: 
"Half a century ago it was discovered that a man could talk through a thousand miles of wire,
and yet now we doubt that a man can descend through fourteen miles of rock."

This is an atom: 
As to the Artesian ray itself, there could be no doubt whatever, for when Clewe, in one of
his experiments, directed it horizontally through a small mountain and objects could be plainly
discerned upon the other side, discussions in regard to the genuineness of the action of the
photic borer were useless.

This is an atom: 
In medicine, as well as surgery, the value of the Artesian ray was speedily admitted by the
civilized world.  To eliminate everything between the eye of the surgeon and the affected portion
of a human organism was like the rising of the sun upon a hitherto benighted region.

This is an atom: 
In the winter, Margaret Raleigh and Roland Clewe were married. They travelled; they lived and
loved in pleasant places; and they returned the next year rich in new ideas and old art trophies.
They bought a fine estate, and furnished it and improved it as an artist paints a picture,
without a thought of the cost of the colors he puts upon it.  They were rich enough to have
everything they cared to wish for.  Undue toil and troubled thought had been the companions
of Roland Clewe for many a year, and their company had been imposed upon him by his poverty;
now he would not, nor would his wife, allow that companionship to be imposed upon him by his
riches.

This is an atom: 
The Great Stone of Sardis was sold to a syndicate of kings, each member of which was unwilling
that this dominant gem of the world should belong exclusively to any royal family other than
his own. When a coronation should occur, each member of the syndicate had a right to the use
of the jewel; at other times it remained in the custody of one of the great bankers of the
world, who at stated periods allowed the inhabitants of said planet to gaze upon its transcendent
brilliancy.

This is an atom: 
But the Works at Sardis were not given up.  Margaret was not jealous of her rival, Science,
and if Roland had ceased to be an inventor, a discoverer, a philosopher, simply because he
had become a rich and happy husband, he would have ceased to be the Roland she had loved so long.

This is an atom: 
The discovery of the north pole had given him fame and honor; for, notwithstanding the fact
that he had never been there, he was always considered as the man who had given to the world
its only knowledge of its most northern point.

This is an atom: 
But in his heart Roland Clewe placed little value upon this discovery.  Before Mr. Gibbs had
announced the exact location of the north pole, all the students of geography had known where
it was; before the eyes of the party on the Dipsey had rested upon the spot pointed out by
Mr. Gibbs, it was well understood that the north pole was either an invisible point on the
surface of ice or an invisible point on the surface of water.  If no possible good could result
from a journey such as the Dipsey had made, no subsequent good of a similar kind could ever
be expected; for the next submarine vessel which attempted a northern journey under the ice
was as likely to remain under the ice as it was to emerge into the open air; and if any one
reached the open sea upon motor sledges, it would be necessary for them to carry boats with
them if they desired so much as a sight of that weather-vane which, no matter how the wind
blew, always pointed to the south.

This is an atom: 
It was the Artesian ray which Clewe considered the great achievement of his life, and to this
he intended to devote the remainder of his working days.  It was his object to penetrate deeper
and deeper with this ray into the interior of the earth. He could always provide himself with
telescopes which would show him the limit reached by his photic borer, and so long as that
limit was a transparent disk, illuminated by his great ray, so long he would believe in the
existence of the diamond centre of the earth.  But when the penetrating light reached something
different, then would come the time for a change in his theories.

This is an atom: 
Discussion and controversy in regard to the discoveries of the Artesian ray continued, often
with great earnestness and heat, in learned circles, and there were frequent demands upon Clewe
to demonstrate the truth of his descent of fourteen miles below the surface of the earth by
an actual exhibition of the shaft he had made or by the construction of another.

This is an atom: 
This augury we know to have been recorded many centuries before its consummation; so that no
juggling or collusion between the prophets and the witnesses to the final event can be suspected.
Some others might be added. At present I shall notice a coincidence from our own history,
which, though not so important as to come within the class of prefigurations I have been
alluding to, is yet curious enough to deserve mention. The oak of
Boscobel and its history are matter of household knowledge.As to a new shaft--that would require a new automatic shell, and this Clewe was not willing
to construct.  In fact, rather than make a new opening to the cave of light, he would prefer
that people should doubt that any such cave existed.  The more he thought of his own descent
into that great cleft, the more he thought of the horrible danger of sliding down some invisible
declivity to awful, unknown regions; the more he thought of the mysterious death of Rovinski,
the more firmly did he determine that not by his agency should a human being descend again
to those mysterious depths.  He would do all that he could to enable men to see into the interior
of this earth, but he would do nothing to help any man to get there.

This is an atom: 
The controversies in regard to their discoveries and theory disturbed Roland and Margaret not
a whit; they worked steadily, with energy and zeal, and, above all, they worked without that
dreadful cloud which so frequently overhangs the laborer in new fields--the fear that the means
of labor will disappear before the object of the work shall come in view.

This is an atom: 
One morning in the early summer, Roland rushed into the room where Margaret sat.

This is an atom: 
"I have made a discovery!" he exclaimed.  "Come quickly, I want to show it to you!"

This is an atom: 
The heart of the young wife sank.  During all these happy days the only shadow that ever flitted
across her sky was the thought that some novel temptation of science might turn her husband
from the great work to which he had dedicated himself.  Much that he had purposed to do, he
had, at her earnest solicitation, set aside in favor of what she considered the greatest task
to which a human being could give his time, his labor, and his thought. It had been long since
she had heard her husband speak of a new discovery, and the words chilled her spirit.

This is an atom: 
"Come," he said, "quickly!"  And, taking her by the hand, he led her out upon the lawn.

This is an atom: 
Over the soft green turf, under the beautiful trees, by the bright flowers of the parterres
and through the natural beauty of the charming park, he led her; but not a word did she say
of the soft colors and the soft air.  Not a flower did she look at.  It seemed to her as if
she trod a bleak and stony road.  She dreaded what she might hear, what she might see.

This is an atom: 
He led her hastily through a gate in the garden wall; they passed through the garden, and,
whispering to her to step lightly, they entered a quiet, shady spot beyond the house grounds.

This is an atom: 
"This way," he whispered.  "Stoop down.  Do you see that shining thing with bright-red patches
of color?  It is an old tomato-can; a robin has built her nest in it; there are three dear
little birds inside; the mother-bird is away, and I wanted you to come before she returned.
Isn't it lucky that I should have found that?  And here, in our own grounds?  I don't believe
there was ever another robin who made her nest in a tomato-can!"

This is an atom: 
Doubtless the two birds who had made that nest sincerely loved each other; and there were at
that moment a great many other birds, and a great many men and women, in the same plight, but
never anywhere did any human being possess a soul so happy as that of Margaret at that moment.

This is an atom: 
"Roland," she said, "when I first knew you, you would not have noticed such a little thing
as that."

This is an atom: 
"I couldn't afford it," he said.

This is an atom: 
"It is the sweetest charm of all your triumphs!"  said she.

This is an atom: 
"What is?" he asked.

This is an atom: 
"That you feel able to afford it now," answered Margaret.

This is an atom: 
Samuel Block and his wife Sarah found that life grew pleasanter as they grew older.  Fortunate
winds had blown down to them from the distant north; the substantial rewards of the enterprise
were eminently satisfactory, and the honors which came to them were not at all unwelcome even
to the somewhat cynical Samuel.

This is an atom: 
Sitting one evening with his wife before a cheering fire--for both of them were wedded to the
old-fashioned ways of keeping warm--Sammy laid down the daily paper with a smile.

This is an atom: 
"There's an account here," he said, "of a lot o' fools who are goin' to fit out a submarine-ship
to try to go under the ice to the pole, as we did.  They may get there, and they may get back;
they may get there, and they may never get back; and they may never get there, and never get
back; but whichever of the three it happens to be, it'll be of no more good than if they measured
a mile to see how many inches there was in it."

This is an atom: 
"Sammy," exclaimed Sarah, "I do think you are old enough to stop talkin' such nonsense as that.
To be sure, there was a good many things that I objected to in that voyage to the pole.  In
the first place, there was thirteen people on board, which was the greatest mistake ever committed
by a human explorin' party; and then, agin, there was no provision for keepin' whales from
bumpin' the ship, and if you knew the number of hours that I laid awake on that Dipsey thinkin'
what would happen if the frolicsome whale determined not to be left alone, and should follow
us into narrow quarters, you would understand my feelin's on that subject; but as to sayin'
there wasn't no good in the expedition --I think that's downright wickedness.  Look at that
fender; look at them andirons, them beautiful brass candlesticks, and that shovel and tongs,
with handles shinin' like gold!  If it hadn't been that we discovered the pole, and so got
able to afford good furniture, all those handsome things would have been made of common silver,
just as if they was pots and kittles, or garden-spades!"

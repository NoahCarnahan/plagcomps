"I heard it. I felt it. It was like the beating of wings." Frontispiece

This is an atom: 
"I told you the place was uncanny."

This is an atom: 
Consequently the martyrs were made into a hierarchy of saintly
protectors of the strayed flock of Christ, and round their graves
in the catacombs sprang up a harvest of tales, of visions, of
miracles, and of superstitions.

This is an atom: 
As the Church sank lower and lower, as the need of a heavenly
advocate with God was more and more impressed upon the minds of the
Christians of those days, the idea seems to have arisen that
neighborhood of burial to the grave of some martyr might be an
effectual way to secure the felicity of the soul.

This is an atom: 
Consequently we find in these chapels that the later Christians,
those perhaps of the fifth and sixth centuries, disregarding the
original arrangements, and having lost all respect for the Art, and
all reverence for the memorial pictures which made the walls precious,
were often accustomed to cut out graves in the walls above and
around the martyr's tomb, and as near as possible to it.

This is an atom: 
The instances are numerous in which pictures of the highest interest have been thus ruthlessly
defaced. No sacredness of subject could resist the force of the superstition; and we remember
one instance where, in a picture of which the part that remains
is of peculiar interest, the body of the Good Shepherd has been cut
through for the grave of a child,--so that only the feet and a part
of the head of the figure remain.

This is an atom: 
There is little reason for supposing, as has frequently been done, that the catacombs, even
in times of persecution, afforded shelter to any large body of the
faithful.

This is an atom: 
Lord Doyne said courteously: "I have a reserved carriage. The railway company is always good
enough to place one at my disposal. It would give me great pleasure if you would share it."

This is an atom: 
The invitation was accepted, and the three men crossed the busy, crowded platform to take their
seats in the great express train. A porter, laden with an incredible load of paraphernalia,
trying to make his way through the press, happened to jostle Sir Angus McCurdie. He rubbed
his shoulder fretfully.

This is an atom: 
"Why the whole land should be turned into a bear garden on account of this exploded superstition
of Christmas is one of the anomalies of modern civilization. Look at this insensate welter
of fools travelling in wild herds to disgusting places merely because it's Christmas!"

This is an atom: 
"You seem to be travelling yourself, McCurdie," said Lord Doyne.

This is an atom: 
"Yes--and why the devil I'm doing it, I've not the faintest notion," replied Sir Angus.

This is an atom: 
"It's going to be a beast of a journey," he remarked some moments later, as the train carried
them slowly out of the station. "The whole country is under snow--and as far as I can understand
we have to change twice and wind up with a twenty-mile motor drive."

This is an atom: 
He was an iron-faced, beetle-browed, stern man, and this morning he did not seem to be in the
best of tempers. Finding his companions inclined to be sympathetic, he continued his lamentation.

This is an atom: 
"And merely because it's Christmas I've had to shut up my laboratory and give my young fools
a holiday--just when I was in the midst of a most important series of experiments."

This is an atom: 
Professor Biggleswade, who had heard vaguely of and rather looked down upon such new-fangled
toys as radium and thorium and helium and argon--for the latest astonishing developments in
the theory of radio-activity had brought Sir Angus McCurdie his world-wide fame--said somewhat
ironically:

This is an atom: 
"If the experiments were so important, why didn't you lock yourself up with your test tubes
and electric batteries and finish them alone?"

This is an atom: 
"Man!" said McCurdie, bending across the carriage, and speaking with a curious intensity of
voice, "d'ye know I'd give a hundred pounds to be able to answer that question?"

This is an atom: 
"What do you mean?" asked the Professor, startled.

This is an atom: 
"I should like to know why I'm sitting in this damned train and going to visit a couple of
addle-headed society people whom I'm scarcely acquainted with, when I might be at home in my
own good company furthering the progress of science."

This is an atom: 
"I myself," said the Professor, "am not acquainted with them at all."

This is an atom: 
It was Sir Angus McCurdie's turn to look surprised.

This is an atom: 
"Then why are you spending Christmas with them?"

This is an atom: 
"I reviewed a ridiculous blank-verse tragedy written by Deverill on the Death of Sennacherib.
Historically it was puerile. I said so in no measured terms. He wrote a letter claiming to
be a poet and not an archæologist. I replied that the day had passed when poets could with
impunity commit the abominable crime of distorting history. He retorted with some futile argument,
and we went on exchanging letters, until his invitation and my acceptance concluded the correspondence."

This is an atom: 
McCurdie, still bending his black brows on him, asked him why he had not declined. --But it is
best to let him speak for himself. I found him that night very feverish, yet not wild at all.

This is an atom: 
"Hullo, Doctor!" said he, "I'm all afire! I've ben thinkin' about my old mother's humstead
up to Simsbury, and the great big well to the back door; how I used to tilt that 'are sweep up, of
a hot day, till the bucket went 'way down to the bottom and come up drippin' over,--such
cold, clear water!

This is an atom: 
I swear, I'd give all Madagascar for a drink on't!"
I called the nurse to bring me a small basket of oranges I had sent
out in the morning, expressly for this patient, and squeezing the
juice from one of them on a little bit of ice, I held it to his
lips, and he drank eagerly.

This is an atom: 
"That's better for you than water, Jackson," said I.

This is an atom: 
"I dunno but 'tis, Doctor; I dunno but 'tis; but there a'n't nothin' goes to the spot like that
Simsbury water. You ha'n't never v'yaged to them parts, have ye?"
"Bless you, yes, man! I was born and brought up in Hartford, just over the mountain, and I've
been to Simsbury, fishing, many a time."
"Good Lord! _You_ don't never desert a feller, ef the ship _is_
a-goin' down!"

This is an atom: 
fervently ejaculated Eben, looking up as he did sometimes in his
brief delirium, when he said the Lord's Prayer, and thought his
mother held his folded hands; but this was no delirious aspiration.

This is an atom: 
He went on:--
"You see, Doctor, I've had somethin' in the hold a good spell't I
wanted to break bulk on, but I didn't know as I ever was goin' to
see a shipmet agin; and now you've jined convoy jist in time, for
Davy Jones's a'n't fur off.

This is an atom: 
Are you calculatin' to go North afore long?"
"Yes, I mean to go next spring," said I.

This is an atom: 
Jackson began to fumble with weak and trembling hands about his
throat, to undo his shirt-collar,--he would not let me help him,--and
presently, flushed and panting from the effort, he drew out a length
of delicate Panama chain fastened rudely together by a link of
copper wire, and suspended on it a little old-fashioned ring of
reddish gold, twisted of two wires, and holding a very small dark
garnet.

This is an atom: 
Jackson looked at it as I have seen many a Catholic look at his reliquary in mortal sickness.

This is an atom: 
"Well," said he, "I've carried that 'are gimcrack nigh twenty long
year round my old scrag, and when I'm sunk I want you to take it
off, Doctor.

This is an atom: 
Keep it safe till you go to Connecticut, and then some day take a tack over to Simsbury. Don't
ye go through the Gap, but go 'long out on the turnpike over the mountain, and down t'other
side to Avon, and so nor'ard till jist arter you git into Simsbury town you see an old red
house 'longside o' the mountain, with a big ellum-tree afore the door, and a stone well to the side
on't. Go 'long in and ask for Hetty Buel, and give her that 'are thing, and tell her where
you got it, and that I ha'n't never forgot to wish her well allus, though I couldn't write to
her."
There was Eben Jackson's romance! It piqued my curiosity. The poor fellow was wakeful and
restless,--I knew he would not sleep, if I left him,--and I encouraged him to go on talking.

This is an atom: 
"I will, Jackson, I promise you. But wouldn't it be better for you
to tell me something about where you have been all these long years?

This is an atom: 
Your friends will like to know."

This is an atom: 
His eye brightened; he was like all the rest of us, pleased with
any interest taken in him and his; he turned over on his pillow,
and I lifted him into a half-sitting position.

This is an atom: 
"Ay," said McCurdie.

This is an atom: 
Lord Doyne said nothing, but tugged at his moustache and looked out of the window as the frozen
meadows and bits of river and willows raced past. A dead silence fell on them. McCurdie broke
it with another laugh and took a whiskey flask from his hand-bag.

This is an atom: 
"Have a nip?"

This is an atom: 
"Thanks, no," said the Professor. "I have to keep to a strict dietary, and I only drink hot
milk and water--and of that sparingly. I have some in a thermos bottle."

This is an atom: 
Lord Doyne also declining the whiskey, McCurdie swallowed a dram and declared himself to be
better. The Professor took from his bag a foreign review in which a German sciolist had dared
to question his interpretation of a Hittite inscription. Over the man's ineptitude he fell
asleep and snored loudly.

This is an atom: 
To escape from his immediate neighbourhood McCurdie went to the other end of the seat and faced
Lord Doyne, who had resumed his gold glasses and his listless contemplation of obscure actresses.
McCurdie lit a pipe, Doyne another black cigar. The train thundered on.

This is an atom: 
Presently they all lunched together in the restaurant car. The windows steamed, but here and
there through a wiped patch of pane a white world was revealed. The snow was falling. As they
passed through Westbury, McCurdie looked mechanically for the famous white horse carved into
the chalk of the down; but it was not visible beneath the thick covering of snow.

This is an atom: 
"It'll be just like this all the way to Gehenna--Trehenna, I mean," said McCurdie.

This is an atom: 
Doyne nodded. He had done his life's work amid all extreme fiercenesses of heat and cold, in
burning droughts, in simoons and in icy wildernesses, and a ray or two more of the pale sun
or a flake or two more of the gentle snow of England mattered to him but little. But Biggleswade
rubbed the pane with his table-napkin and gazed apprehensively at the prospect.

This is an atom: 
"If only this wretched train would stop," said he, "I would go back again."

This is an atom: 
And he thought how comfortable it would be to sneak home again to his books and thus elude
not only the Deverills, but the Christmas jollities of his sisters' families, who would think
him miles away. But the train was timed not to stop till Plymouth, two hundred and thirty-five
miles from London, and thither was he being relentlessly carried. Then he quarrelled with his
food, which brought a certain consolation.

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
The train did stop, however, before Plymouth--indeed, before Exeter. An accident on the line
had dislocated the traffic. The express was held up for an hour, and when it was permitted
to proceed, instead of thundering on, it went cautiously, subject to continual stoppings. It
arrived at Plymouth two hours late. The travellers learned that they had missed the connection
on which they had counted and that they could not reach Trehenna till nearly ten o'clock. But no
large number of persons could have existed within them. The closeness of the air would very
soon have rendered life insupportable; and supposing any considerable number had collected near
the outlet, where a supply of fresh air could have reached them, the difficulty of obtaining
food and of concealing their place of retreat would have been in most instances insurmountable.
The catacombs were always places for the few, not for the many; for the few who followed a body
to the grave; for the few who dug the narrow, dark passages in which not many could work; for
the few who came to supply the needs of some hunted and hidden friend; for the few who in better
times assembled to join in the service commemorating the last
supper of their Lord.

This is an atom: 
It is difficult, as we have said before, to clear away the obscuring fictions of the Roman
Church from the entrance of the catacombs; but doing this so far
as with our present knowledge may be done, we find ourselves entering
upon paths that bring us into near connection and neighborhood with
the first followers of the founders of our faith at Rome.

This is an atom: 
The reality which is given to the lives of the Christians of the
first centuries by acquaintance with the memorials that they have
left of themselves here quickens our feeling for them into one
almost of personal sympathy.

This is an atom: 
"Your obedience is come abroad unto all men," wrote St. Paul to the first Christians of Rome.
The record of that obedience is in the catacombs.

This is an atom: 
And in the vast labyrinth of obscure galleries one beholds and enters into the spirit of the
first followers of the Apostle to the Gentiles.

This is an atom: 
[To be continued.]

This is an atom: 
THE NEST.

This is an atom: 
MAY.

This is an atom: 
When oaken woods with buds are pink, And new-come birds each morning sing,-- When fickle May
on Summer's brink Pauses, and knows not which to fling, Whether
fresh bud and bloom again, Or hoar-frost silvering hill and plain,--

This is an atom: 
Then from the honeysuckle gray The oriole with experienced quest
Twitches the fibrous bark away, The cordage of his hammock-nest,--
Cheering his labor with a note Rich as the orange of his throat.

This is an atom: 
High o'er the loud and dusty road The soft gray cup in safety swings,
To brim ere August with its load Of downy breasts and throbbing
wings, O'er which the friendly elm-tree heaves An emerald roof with
sculptured eaves.

This is an atom: 
Below, the noisy World drags by In the old way, because it must,-- The bride with trouble in her
eye, The mourner following hated dust:

This is an atom: 
Thy duty, winged flame of Spring, Is but to love and fly and sing.

This is an atom: 
Oh, happy life, to soar and sway Above the life by mortals led,
Singing the merry months away, Master, not slave of daily bread,
And, when the Autumn comes, to flee Wherever sunshine beckons thee!

This is an atom: 
PALINODE.--DECEMBER.

This is an atom: 
Like some lorn abbey now, the wood Stands roofless in the bitter air; In ruins on its floor
is strewed The carven foliage quaint and rare, And homeless winds complain along The columned
choir once thrilled with song.

This is an atom: 
And thou, dear nest, whence joy and praise The thankful oriole used to pour, Swing'st empty
while the north winds chase Their snowy swarms from Labrador:
But, loyal to the happy past, I love thee still for what thou wast.

This is an atom: 
Ah, when the Summer graces flee From other nests more dear than thou, And, where June crowded
once, I see Only bare trunk and disleaved bough, When springs of
life that gleamed and gushed Run chilled, and slower, and are
hushed,--
I'll think, that, like the birds of Spring, Our good goes not without
repair, But only flies to soar and sing Far off in some diviner
air, Where we shall find it in the calms Of that fair garden 'neath
the palm

This is an atom:

A tiny electric lamp inside the hood made the darkness
of the world to right and left and in front of the talc windows still darker. McCurdie and
Biggleswade fell into a doze. Lord Doyne chewed the end of his cigar. The car sped on through
an unseen wilderness.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly there was a horrid jolt and a lurch and a leap and a rebound, and then the car stood
still, quivering like a ship that has been struck by a heavy sea. The three men were pitched
and tossed and thrown sprawling over one another onto the bottom of the car. Biggleswade screamed.
McCurdie cursed. Doyne scrambled from the confusion of rugs and limbs and, tearing open the
side of the Cape-cart hood, jumped out. The chauffeur had also just leaped from his seat. It
was pitch dark save for the great shaft of light down the snowy road cast by the acetylene
lamps. The snow had ceased falling.

This is an atom: 
"What's gone wrong?"

This is an atom: 
"It sounds like the axle," said the chauffeur ruefully.

This is an atom: 
He unshipped a lamp and examined the car, which had wedged itself against a great drift of
snow on the off side. Meanwhile McCurdie and Biggleswade had alighted.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, it's the axle," said the chauffeur.

This is an atom: 
"Then we're done," remarked Doyne.

This is an atom: 
"I'm afraid so, my lord."

This is an atom: 
"What's the matter? Can't we get on?" asked Biggleswade in his querulous voice.

This is an atom: 
McCurdie laughed. "How can we get on with a broken axle? The thing's as useless as a man with
a broken back. Gad, I was right. I said it was going to be an infernal journey."

This is an atom: 
The little Professor wrung his hands. "But what's to be done?" he cried.

This is an atom: 
"Tramp it," said Lord Doyne, lighting a fresh cigar.

This is an atom: 
"It's ten miles," said the chauffeur.

This is an atom: 
"It would be the death of me," the Professor wailed.

This is an atom: 
"I utterly refuse to walk ten miles through a Polar waste with a gouty foot," McCurdie declared
wrathfully.

This is an atom: 
The chauffeur offered a solution of the difficulty. He would set out alone for Foullis Castle--five
miles farther on was an inn where he could obtain a horse and trap--and would return for the
three gentlemen with another car. In the meanwhile they could take shelter in a little house
which they had just passed, some half mile up the road. This was agreed to. The chauffeur went
on cheerily enough with a lamp, and the three travellers with another lamp started off in the
opposite direction. As far as they could see they were in a long, desolate valley, a sort of
No Man's Land, deathly silent. The eastern sky had cleared somewhat, and they faced a loose
rack through which one pale star was dimly visible.

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
"I'm a man of science," said McCurdie as they trudged through the snow, "and I dismiss the
supernatural as contrary to reason; but I have Highland blood in my veins that plays me exasperating
tricks. My reason tells me that this place is only a commonplace moor, yet it seems like a
Valley of Bones haunted by malignant spirits who have lured us here to our destruction. There's
something guiding us now. It's just uncanny."

This is an atom: 
"Why on earth did we ever come?" croaked Biggleswade.

This is an atom: 
Lord Doyne answered: "The Koran says, 'Nothing can befall us but what God hath destined for
us.' So why worry?"

This is an atom:

EBEN JACKSON.

This is an atom: 
Fear no more the heat o' the sun, Nor the furious winter's rages; Thou thine earthly task hast
done.

This is an atom: 
The large tropical moon rose in full majesty over the Gulf of Mexico, that beneath it rolled a
weltering surge of silver, which broke upon the level sand of the beach with a low, sullen
roar, prophetic of storms to come. To-night a south wind was heavily blowing over Gulf and
prairie, laden with salt odors of weed and grass, now and then crossed by a strain of such
perfume as only tropic breezes know,--a breath of heavy, passionate
sweetness from orange-groves and rose gardens, mixed with the
miasmatic sighs of rank forests, and mile on mile of tangled
cane-brake, where jewel-tinted snakes glitter and emit their own
sickly-sweet odor, and the deep blue bells of luxuriant vines wave
from their dusky censers steams of poisonous incense.

This is an atom: 
I endured the influence of all this as long as I dared, and then
turned my pony's head from the beach, and, loitering through the
city's hot streets, touched him into a gallop as the prairie opened
before us, and followed the preternatural, colossal shadow of horse
and man east by the moon across the dry dull grass and bitter yellow
chamomile growth of the sand, till I stopped at the office door of
the Hospital, when, consigning my horse to a servant, I commenced
my nightly round of the wards.

This is an atom: 
There were but few patients just now, for the fever had not yet
made its appearance, and until within a week the unwontedly clear
and cool atmosphere had done the work of the physician.

This is an atom: 
Most of the sick were doing well enough without me; some few needed
and received attention; and these disposed of, I betook myself to
the last bed in one of the long wards, quite apart from the others,
which was occupied by a sailor, a man originally from New England,
whose hard life and continual exposure to all climates and weathers
had at length resulted in slow tubercular consumption.

This is an atom: 
It was one of the rare cases of this disease not supervening upon an original strumous diathesis,
and, had it been properly cared for in the beginning, might have
been cured.

This is an atom: 
Now there was no hope; but the case being a peculiar and interesting one, I kept a faithful
record of its symptoms and progress for publication. Besides, I liked the man; rugged and
hardy by nature, it was curious to see what strange effects a long,
wasting, and painful disease produced upon him.

This is an atom: 
Biggleswade
put on the table a bundle which he had picked up outside. It contained some poor provisions--a
loaf, a piece of fat bacon, and a paper of tea. As far as they could guess (and as they learned
later they guessed rightly) the man was the master of the house, who, coming home blind drunk
from some distant inn, had fallen at his own threshold and got frozen to death. As they could
not unclasp his fingers from the broken bottleneck they had to let him clutch it as a dead
warrior clutches the hilt of his broken sword.

This is an atom: 
Then suddenly the whole place was rent with another and yet another long, soul-piercing moan
of anguish.

This is an atom: 
"There's a second room," said Doyne, pointing to a door. "The sound comes from there." He opened
the door, peeped in, and then, returning for the lamp, disappeared, leaving McCurdie and Biggleswade
in the pitch darkness, with the dead man on the floor.

This is an atom: 
"For heaven's sake, give me a drop of whiskey," said the Professor, "or I shall faint."

This is an atom: 
Presently the door opened and Lord Doyne appeared in the shaft of light. He beckoned to his
companions.

This is an atom: 
"It is a woman in childbirth," he said in his even, tired voice. "We must aid her. She appears
unconscious. Does either of you know anything about such things?"

This is an atom: 
They shook their heads, and the three looked at each other in dismay. Masters of knowledge
that had won them world-wide fame and honour, they stood helpless, abashed before this, the
commonest phenomenon of nature.

This is an atom: 
"My wife had no child," said McCurdie.

This is an atom: 
"I've avoided women all my life," said Biggleswade.

This is an atom: 
"And I've been too busy to think of them. God forgive me," said Doyne.

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
The history of the next two hours was one that none of the three men ever cared to touch upon.
They did things blindly, instinctively, as men do when they come face to face with the elemental.
A fire was made, they knew not how, water drawn they knew not whence, and a kettle boiled.
Doyne accustomed to command, directed. The others obeyed. At his suggestion they hastened to
the wreck of the car and came staggering back beneath rugs and travelling bags which could
supply clean linen and needful things, for amid the poverty of the house they could find nothing
fit for human touch or use. It is impossible to ascertain the date at which these chapels
were first made; probably some time about the middle of the second century they became common.
In many of the catacombs they are very numerous, and it is in them that the chief ornaments and
decorations, and the paintings which give to the catacombs an
especial value and importance in the history of Art, and which are
among the most interesting illustrations of the state of religious
feeling and belief in the early centuries, are found.

This is an atom: 
Some of the chapels are known to be of comparatively late date, of the fourth and perhaps of the
fifth century. In several even of earlier construction is found, in addition to the altar,
a niche cut out in the rock, or a ledge projecting from it, which seems to have been intended
to serve the place of the credence table, for holding the articles
used in the service of the altar, and at a later period for receiving
the elements before they were handed to the priest for consecration.

This is an atom: 
The earliest services in the catacombs were undoubtedly those connected with the communion of
the Lord's Supper. The mystery of the mass and the puzzles of transubstantiation had not yet
been introduced among the believers; but all who had received baptism as followers of Christ, all
save those who had fallen away into open and manifest sin, were admitted to partake of the Lord's
Supper. Possibly upon some occasions these chapels may have been filled with the sounds of exhortation
and lamentation.
In the legends of the Roman Church we read of large numbers of Christians being buried alive,
in time of persecution, in these underground chambers where they had assembled for worship and
for counsel. But we are not aware of any proof of the truth of these stories having been
discovered in recent times. This, and many other questionable points in the history and in
the uses of the catacombs, may be solved by the investigations which are now proceeding; and
it is fortunate for the interests, not only of truth, but of
religion, that so learned and so honest-minded a man as the Cavaliere
de Rossi should have the direction of these explorations.

This is an atom: 
Few of the chapels that are to be seen now in the catacombs are in their original condition.

This is an atom: 
This
is the fourth."

This is an atom: 
Biggleswade plucked nervously at the fringe of whisker under his jaws and said faintly, "It's
the fourth time up to now. I thought it was fancy."

This is an atom: 
"I have felt it, too," said Doyne. "It is the Angel of Death." And he pointed to the room where
the dead man and woman lay.

This is an atom: 
"For God's sake let us get away from this," cried Biggleswade.

This is an atom: 
"And leave the child to die, like the others?" said Doyne.

This is an atom: 
"We must see it through," said McCurdie.

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
A silence fell upon them as they sat round in the blaze with the new-born babe wrapped in its
odd swaddling clothes asleep on the pile of fur coats, and it lasted until Sir Angus McCurdie
looked at his watch.

This is an atom: 
"Good Lord," said he, "it's twelve o'clock."

This is an atom: 
"Christmas morning," said Biggleswade.

This is an atom: 
"A strange Christmas," mused Doyne.

This is an atom: 
McCurdie put up his hand. "There it is again! The beating of wings." And they listened like
men spellbound. McCurdie kept his hand uplifted, and gazed over their heads at the wall, and
his gaze was that of a man in a trance, and he spoke:

This is an atom: 
"Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given--"

This is an atom: 
Doyne sprang from his chair, which fell behind him with a crash.

This is an atom: 
"Man--what the devil are you saying?"

This is an atom: 
Then McCurdie rose and met Biggleswade's eyes staring at him through the great round spectacles,
and Biggleswade turned and met the eyes of Doyne. A pulsation like the beating of wings stirred
the air.

This is an atom: 
The three wise men shivered with a queer exaltation. Something strange, mystical, dynamic had
happened. It was as if scales had fallen from their eyes and they saw with a new vision. But
as the disease gained ground, its characteristic languor unstrung his force; the hard and sinewy
limbs became attenuated and relaxed; his breath labored; a hectic fever burnt in his veins like light
flame every afternoon, and subsided into chilly languor toward
morning; profuse night-sweats increased the weakness; and as he

their stains and scars on his weather-beaten visage, whose only notable features were the
deep-set eyes retreating under shaggy brows, that looked one through and through with the

with them, an inalienable joy and possession, into the great world.

This is an atom: 
)--"for by this tender title I am permitted to address you at
last" (by whom?

This is an atom: 
)--"I cannot flatter myself that, in concurring with the wishes of your friends,
you return my fervent passion" (you are mistaken there; I do return it with the seal unbroken);
"but will you not suffer me to hope that the deep, disinterested devotion of months may undo
the past, and dissolve those bitter prejudices which I feel well aware were instilled into
your heart by one of the coldest and most time-serving of men" (of course, hope is free to
all; it is no longer kept in a box, as in the days of Pandora)?

This is an atom: 
"When I assure you that Wentworth,
with a perfect knowledge of your present situation, has repudiated the past, you will more
perfectly understand my reference" (I will believe this when he tells me so, not before; your
assertion simply reassures me).

This is an atom: 
"It is not, however, to place my own devotion in contrast with
his perfidy, that I now address you" (Nature drew the contrast, fortunately for him, without
your assistance), "but to beseech you, for your own sake, to let nothing turn you from your
recently-formed resolution" (I don't intend to let any thing turn me, if I can help it, this
time!).

This is an atom: 
"It remains with you to live a free and happy life, adored and indulged by one who
would give his heart's blood to serve you" (a poor gift, I take it), "or pass your whole existence
in the cell of a lunatic, cut off from every being who could care for or protect you.

This is an atom: 
what can the wretch mean?

This is an atom: 
) "Should you refuse to become my wife, and affix your signature
to the papers in your possession, I have reason to know that Bainrothe designs to make, or
rather continue, you dead, and imprison you in a lonely house on the sea-coast, which he owns,
where others of his victims have before now lived and died unknown!

This is an atom: 
" (Very melodramatic, truly;
but I don't believe Cagliostro would dare to do it.

This is an atom: 
Engelehart is instructed to place in your hands a note recently intercepted by me from
that arch-conspirator to his son, which please return to him, my truest friend" (direst enemy,
you mean), "along with this letter, as I send you both documents at my own peril, and dare
not leave them in your hands" (how magnanimous!

This is an atom: 
); and here I dropped the letter on the table,
and extended my hand mutely to Dr.

This is an atom: 
Englehart for the note, which was ready for me, in the hollow
of his pudgy palm.

This is an atom: 
Returning it to the physician _pro tem_., I then continued the perusal of this singular love-letter
to the end, in which the lawyer and knave predominated in spite of Eros!

This is an atom: 
"How long before this ultimatum is proposed to me, which Mr.

This is an atom: 
Gregory seemed to anticipate,
and with which you, no doubt, are acquainted?

This is an atom: 
"Ten days will close up de whole transaction, as I understand," was the no less cool reply,
made in those husky, inimitable tones, peculiar to the man of petty pills.

This is an atom: 
It would seem a short time wherein to get up a reasonable trousseau, even!

This is an atom: 
but nosing of dat kind is necessaire under dese circumstances--only your mos'
gracious and graceful consent!

This is an atom: 
" He spoke eagerly, with bowed head and clasped hands, standing
mutely before me when he had concluded.

This is an atom: 
Gregory loved me truly, he would not limit me thus," I hazarded.

This is an atom: 
"He would give me
time to learn to return his affection, as I must try to do, and to forget the past!

This is an atom: 
He would
not strike hands with my persecutors, but insist on my liberation--or obtain it, as he could
readily do, without their coöperation, through you, Dr.

This is an atom: 
Englehart, who seem to be his friend
and ally, and who have already run such risks for his sake in bringing me these two dangerous
letters," and as I spoke I pushed them across the table, to be gathered up and concealed with
well-affected eagerness.

This is an atom: 
How perfectly he played his part, and how cunningly Bainrothe had contrived to convey to me
his menace--real, or assumed for effect, I could not tell which, for my judgment spoke one
language, my cowardice another!

This is an atom: 
Yet, I confess, that the panic was complete, though I concealed
it from the enemy.

This is an atom: 
"Women usually, at least romantic and incredulous women like me, demand some proof of a lover's
devotion," I resumed, as coolly as I could, "before yielding him their faith and fealty; but
Mr.

This is an atom: 
Gregory has given me no evidence so far of the sincerity of his passion; I confess I find
it difficult, under the circumstances, to believe in its existence.

This is an atom: 
"

He drew near to me, bent eagerly above me, then again concealed himself, as it was wise for
him to do, in shadow; and I could hear his hissing breath, as it passed between his closed
teeth--like that of a roused serpent.

This is an atom: 
The impulse of the man came near betraying him, but he
rallied and refrained from an exposure, as he would have supposed it, that must have been fatal
to his success as a lover, even if it confirmed his power of possession.

This is an atom: 
His tones, low and deep, were unmistakably those of suppressed passion when he spoke again,
and he had almost dropped his accent, so wonderfully assumed.

This is an atom: 
"When shall he come to you, and speak for himself?

This is an atom: 
Let me take to him some word of encouragement
from your lips--for de love of whom--he languishes--he dies!

This is an atom: 
All other passions of his life
have proved like cobwebs, compared to this--avarice, ambition, revenge, all yield before it!

This is an atom: 
Do not trample on a fervent heart, thus laid at your feet!

This is an atom: 
"

"Strange language from a captor to a captive--mocking language, that I find unendurable!

This is an atom: 
Gregory remain where he is until the extreme limit of the interval granted me by Basil
Bainrothe--as breathing-space before execution; and before hope expires in thick darkness--then
let him come and take what he will find of the victim of so much perfidy!

This is an atom: 
" He spoke in a voice of agony,
that could scarcely be restrained from breaking into its natural tones.

This is an atom: 
"No--no--do not flatter yourselves that I could be driven by you--by _any_ one to such God-offending,"
I hastened to say, for I felt the importance of keeping this barrier of disguise, of ice, between
Gregory and myself as a means of safety for a season, and determined that he should not transcend
it, if I could prevent an _exposé_, such as his excited feelings made imminent.

This is an atom: 
"My hopes are
dead--say this to Mr.

This is an atom: 
Gregory--and I have reason to believe I should fare as well in his hands
as in any other's, knowing him--as I know him to be--" and I hesitated here for a moment--"gentle,
compassionate, faithful, where his feelings are fairly enlisted.

This is an atom: 
"

"He thanks you, through my lips, most lovely lady, for dis great proof of consideration; dis'
message, which I shall truthfully deliver, will fill his heart with joy, long a stranger to
his breast, for he has feared your hatred.

This is an atom: 
Englehart, and let no one come to me without previous warning, for I need all
my strength to bear me up in this emergency.

This is an atom: 
Gregory without due preparation--even
of apparel," and I glanced at my dress of spotted lawn, faded and unseasonable as it seemed
in the autumn weather.

This is an atom: 
"I know his fastidiousness on this subject, and from this time it ought
to, it must be my study to try to please him.

This is an atom: 
"

Why was not the fate of Ananias or Sapphira mine after that false utterance?

This is an atom: 
Why did I triumph
in the strength of guile that desperation gave me, rather than sink abashed and penitent beneath
it?

This is an atom: 
And this was the woman who had once lectured on duplicity and expediency, and deemed herself
above them!

This is an atom: 
Bitter and nauseous as was this bowl to me, I drank it without a grimace; so much depended
on the measure of deceit--hope, love, honor, life itself perhaps--for my terrors whispered
that even such warnings as those Gregory had given were not to be disregarded where there was
question of success or failure to Basil Bainrothe!

This is an atom: 
Delay, I scarce could hope for, and, even if granted, how could it avail me in the end?

This is an atom: 
Those
words--"He will make you dead!

This is an atom: 
" rang in my ears, and seemed written on the wall.

This is an atom: 
It was so easy to do this--so easy to repeat what the papers had already told
the world--so easy to confine me in a maniac's cell under an assumed name, and by the aid of
my own gold, and say, "She perished at sea!

This is an atom: 
"

It would be to the interest of all who knew it, to preserve the secret, except the poor ship's
captain, and he had been a dupe, and would scarcely recognize his folly, or, if he did, be
the first to boast of and publish it.

This is an atom: 
Besides that, should the matter be inquired into, how
easy for Bainrothe to allege that my own family had sanctioned his course to save my reputation!

This is an atom: 
He had declared openly his base design.

This is an atom: 
Wentworth might be married by that time, or indifferent, or dead; Ernie too old to make
the matter of a year or two of consequence in the carrying out of the nefarious scheme to sustain
which it would be so easy to summon and suborn witnesses.

This is an atom: 
All these possibilities represented themselves to me with frightful distinctness; my mind became
imbued with them to the exclusion of all else--of reason even.

This is an atom: 
I was literally panic-stricken,
and nothing but flight could satisfy my instinct, my impulse of self-preservation.

This is an atom: 
I had felt this necessity once before, be it remembered, but never so stringently, so morbidly
as now.

This is an atom: 
I was yielding under the agony, the anxiety incident to my condition; my nervous system,
too severely taxed, was breaking down, and it would succumb entirely, unless relief came to
me (of this I felt convinced), before another weary month should roll away.

This is an atom: 
Had I been imprisoned
for a certain term of years as an expiation for crimes, I think I could have borne it better;
but the injustice, the uncertainty of these proceedings were more than I could sustain.

This is an atom: 
I fell asleep, I remember, on the night of my interview with Gregory--_alias_ Englehart--to
dream confusedly of Baron Trenck and his iron collar, and the Princess Amelia and her unmitigated
grief, and it seemed to me that I was given to drink from a cup the poor prisoner had carved
(as memoirs tell us he carved and sold many such), filled with a sort of bitter wine, by the
man in the iron mask--so vividly did Fancy, mixing her ingredients, typify the anguish of my
waking moments, and reproduce its anxieties, in dreams of night that could not be controlled.

This is an atom: 
When I awoke in the morning it was to lie quietly, and listen to the doleful voice of Sabra,
for such had been Dinah's Congo name, uplifted in what she called a "speritual" as she cleaned
the brass mountings of the grate and kindled its tardy fires.

This is an atom: 
With very slight alteration and
adjustment, this picturesque and dramatic Obi hymn is given in this place, just as I jotted
it down in my diary, thus imprinting it on my memory from her own dolphin-like lips and bellows-like
lungs.

This is an atom: 
Her forefathers, she informed me with considerable pride, had been snake-worshipers,
and she certainly inherited their tendency to treat the worst enemy of mankind with respectful
adoration.

This is an atom: 
It served to divert my mind from its one fixed idea for a little time to arrange this singular
hymn, which, together with those she had given voice to on the raft, proved her poetic powers.

This is an atom: 
For Sabra assured me that this gift of sacred song had come to her one day when she was washing
her master's linen, and that she had felt it run cold streaks down her back and through her
brain, and that from that time she was uplifted to sing "sperituals" by spells and seasons.

This is an atom: 
We's on de road to Zion,
        We's on de paf' to Zion,
        But dar's a roarin' lion,
            For Satan stops de way.

This is an atom: 
lef' us pass, rich Masta--
            It am near de break ob day!

This is an atom: 
We's on de road to Zion,
        We's on de paf' to Zion,
        But wid his red-hot iron
            He bars de hebbenly gate!

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
Does you hear de prophets callin'?

This is an atom: 
Does you hear de cherubs squallin'
            Wat's settin' on de gate?

This is an atom:

        Unbar de do', dear Masta,

This is an atom: 
Does you hear de win' a blowin'?

This is an atom: 
Does you hear de chickens crowin'?

This is an atom: 
Does you see de niggars hoein'?

This is an atom: 
We'll gib you all our money,
        We'll fotch you yams and honey,
        We'll fill your pipe wid 'baccer,
            An' twiss your tail wid hay!

This is an atom: 
We'll shod your hoofs wid copper,
        We'll knob your horns wid silber,
        We'll cook you rice and gopher,
            Ef you will clar de way!

This is an atom: 
He's gwine away, my bredderin,
        He's stepped aside, my sisterin,
        He's clared de track, my chillun,
            Now make de trumpets bray!

This is an atom: 
We tanks you kindly, Masta,
        We gibs you tanks, ole Masta,
        You is a buckra Masta,
            Whateber white folks say!

This is an atom: 
Clayton was truly a piteous sight to see--swathed
in flannel and helpless as an infant, yet still perversely vigilant as she had been in her
hours of health, and determined on the subject of opiates as before.

This is an atom: 
I sometimes think she
feared to place herself wholly in my hands, as she must have been under the influence of a
powerful anodyne, and that, in spite of her professions of confidence, and even affection,
she feared me as her foe.

This is an atom: 
God knows that, had it been to save my own life, I would not have
harmed one hair of her viperish head, as flat on top as if the stone of the Indian had been
bound upon its crown from babyhood, yet full of brains to bursting around the base of the skull.

This is an atom: 
It was necessary for Dinah to be in constant attendance on my Argus, and even to feed her,
so helpless were her hands, with the mucilages which now formed her principal diet, by the
order of some celebrated physician who wrote his prescriptions without seeing his patient,
after the form of the ancients, sending them daily through the hands of Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Still
those vigilant green eyes never faltered in their task, and lying where--with the door opened
between our chambers (as she tyrannically required it to be most of the time) she could command
a view of almost every act of my life--I found her scrutiny more unendurable than when she
had at least feigned to be absorbed with her stocking-basket.

This is an atom: 
Ernie's noise, too, disturbed
her, and I was obliged to keep him constantly amused, for fear that her wrath might culminate
in eternal banishment.

This is an atom: 
The days slid on--November had passed through that exquisite phase of existence (which almost
redeems it from the reproach cast upon it through all time, of being _par excellence_ the gloomy
month of the year), the sweet and balmy influences of which had reached us, even through the
walls of our prison-house, in the shape of smoky sunshine, and balmy, odorous, and lingering
blossoms, and was now asserting its traditional character with much angry bluster of sleet,
and storm, and cutting wind.

This is an atom: 
It was Herod lamenting his Mariamne slain by his own hand, and
making others suffer the consequences of his regretted cruelty, his remorseful anguish.

This is an atom: 
It
was the fierce Viking making wild wail over his dead Oriana.

This is an atom: 
No more to come until another year had done its work of resurrection and decay, the lovely
Indian Summer slumbered under her mound of withered flowers and heaps of gorgeous leaves, unheeding
all, or unconscious of the grief of her stern bridegroom.

This is an atom: 
Cold and bitter and bleak howled the November blast, and ruthlessly drove the sleet against
the shivering panes, exposed without, though shielded within by Venetian folding shutters,
on that gray morning, when a passing whisper from most unlovely and altogether unfaithful lips
nerved me paradoxically to sudden resolution.

This is an atom: 
False as I knew old Dinah to be--almost on principle--still, I could not disregard the possible
truth of her passing warning, given in broken whisper first as she poured out my tea and afterward
prepared my bath.

This is an atom: 
"Honey, don't you touch no tea nor coffee dis evening after Dinah goes out ob here an' de bolt
am fetched home; jus' make 'tence to drene it down, like, but don't swaller one mortal drop,
for dey is gwine to give you a dose of laudamy"--nodding sagaciously and peering into the teapot
as she interpolated aloud; "sure enough, it is full ob grounds, honey!

This is an atom: 
(I heerd 'um say dat
wid my own two blessed yers), for de purpose of movin' you soun' asleep up to dat bell-tower
(belfry, b'leves dey call it sometimes)--he!

This is an atom: 
You see, honey, der was an ossifer to sarve a process
writ about somebody here dis mornin', but dar was something wrong about it, so dey all said,
an' he is comin' to sarch de house for you, I spec', to-morrow; for de hue an' cry is out somehow--or
mebbe it's me--he!

This is an atom: 
(very faintly) an' dey is gwine to move you, so dey says, to keep
all dark, after you gets soun' asleep.

This is an atom: 
But de ossifer is 'bleeged to wait till mornin' (court-time,
as I heerd 'em say) comes roun' agin to git de _haby-corpy_ fixed up right, an' dat's how he
spounded hisself.

This is an atom: 
"

"I can scarcely make you understand now, Dinah" (aside).

This is an atom: 
"Don't ask me--just go on, low, very
low; how did you hear all this?

This is an atom: 
"

"Wid my ear to de key-hole, in de study, war dey axed de ossifer.

This is an atom: 
My 'spicions was roused by
de words he 'dressed to me wen I opened de front do', for you see, dat ole nigger watch-dog
ob dern, dat has nebber a good word for nobody, was gone to market, an' Madame Raymond she
hel' de watch, an' she sont me from de kitchen to mine de front-do' bell.

This is an atom: 
"'Old dame,' says the ossifer (for so dey calls him), as pleasant as a mornin' in May; 'has
you a young gal locked up here as you knows ob?

This is an atom: 
Now tell what you choose, and don't be afraid
of dese folks.

This is an atom: 
'

"Den I answered him straightforward like de trufe: 'Dar's nobody in de house heah but wat you
kin see for axin' for 'em, as far as I knows on.

This is an atom: 
Wat young gal do you 'lude to, masta?--Bridget
Maloney, I spose, dat Irish heifer wat does de chambers ebery mornin' and goes home ob ebenin's.

This is an atom: 
Ef you means her, she's off to church to-day, an' sleeps at her mammy's house.

This is an atom: 
'

"'Does you feel willin' to swar to de trufe of your insertion, ole dame?

This is an atom: 
'I
shall resist on dat'--fierce as a buck-rabbit, holdin' up his right hand, an' blinkin' his
little 'cute eyes.

This is an atom: 
"Sartin an' sure I does when de right time is come,' I sez.

This is an atom: 
I neber hab bin in dat place yit since I was sold
in Georgy on de block befo' de high, wooden steps; but I knows it is more solemn to lie dar
dan in Methody meetin'-house.

This is an atom: 
Bainrofe he cum out, hearin' de talk, in dat long-tailed, satin-flowered gownd ob
his'n, wid a silk rope tied roun' his waist, an' gole tossels hangin' in front, jes' like a
Catholic Roman or a king, an' he sez, 'Walk in here, my fren, an' don't tamper wid my servants--dat
ain't gentlem'ly;' den he puts his han' on de ossifer's shoulder, an' dey walked in together,
an' I listened at de do', in duty boun', an' I heerd him say, 'Plant a guard if you choose--do
wateber you like--but, till dat writ am rectified, you can't sarch through my house, for a
man's house is his castle here, as in de Great Britain, till de law reaches out a long arm
an' a strong arm.

This is an atom: 
Bainrofe spounded to de ossifer, an' he 'peared 'fused-like
an' flusterfied, for I peeped fru de key-hole at 'em wen dey wus talkin'.

This is an atom: 
'An,' sez he, 'dis
heah paper does want de secon' seal, sure enough, since I 'xamine it, wat you, is so 'tickiler
'bout; but dat can easily be reconstructified, an' I'll be sartin sure to be here airly to-morrow
morning.

This is an atom: 
In de mean while, my man, McDermot, shall keep de house in his eye, an' mus' hab de
liberty of lodgment.

This is an atom: 
Bainrofe he say, 'Oh, sartinly--your man, McDermot, am welcome to his bite an' sup,
an' all he kin fine out'--an' he laughed, an' dey parted, mighty pleasant-like, and den he
called Mrs.

This is an atom: 
what are you muttering about--don't you hear Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Miss Monfort
must be tired out of your nonsense.

This is an atom: 
What keeps you there so long?

This is an atom: 
"

"I'se spounding another speritual to Miss Mirainy, an', wen I gits 'gaged in dat way, I disregards
airthly knockin'.

This is an atom: 
I'se listenin' to de angels hammerin' overhead, an' Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Raymun' will hab

This is an atom: 
I can write your song down just
as well another time," I remonstrated, taking up and laying down my note-book as I spoke, so
as to display my ostensible occupation to the peering eyes of Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Clayton (now sitting bolt
upright in her bed, looking like a Chinese bonze), for the purpose of sweeping in my position
definitively.

This is an atom: 
"That will do, Dinah.

This is an atom: 
Now go and get Miss Monfort's bath ready," I heard my dragoness say,
after a short whispered communication from her early visitor.

This is an atom: 
It was the idea, probably, to
remove me, as well as Dinah, while the plot was being unfolded, and my bath-room, with its
closed door, promised security from quick ears and eyes to the brace of conspirators now plotting
their final blow.

This is an atom: 
Once in that belfry, and truly might the sense of Dante's famous inscription become my motto
for life: "Here hope is left behind.

This is an atom: 
"

I covered my eyes as I recalled that dreary, dreadful prison-house of clock and bell, into
which I had clambered once by means of a movable step-ladder, rarely left there by the attendant,
in order to rescue my famished cat, shut up there by accident.

This is an atom: 
I recollected the maddened look
of the creature, as it flew by me like a flash, frightened out of its wits, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Austin had
said, by the clicking of the machinery of the huge clock, and the chiming of the responsive
bell.

This is an atom: 
Both were silent now, and there was room enough for a prisoner's cot in that lonely and
dismantled turret as there once had been for a telescope and its rest, used for astronomical
purposes at long intervals by my father and a few of his scientific friends, but finally dismantled
and put aside forever.

This is an atom: 
I could imagine myself a denizen, at the will of Bainrothe, of that weird, gray belfry, shut
up with that silent clock, in company with a bed, a chair, and table, denied, perchance, even
the comfort of a stove, for fear the flue might utter smoke, and, with it, that kind of revelation,
said proverbially to accompany such manifestations; denied books, even writing-materials, the
sight of a human face, and furnished with food merely sufficing in quantity and quality to
keep soul and body together!

This is an atom: 
Could I sustain it and retain my reason?

This is an atom: 
No, I felt that
the picture my fancy drew, if realized, would make me abject and submissive, change me to a
cowardly, cringing slave.

This is an atom: 
I was not made of the right stuff for martyrdom, only for battle,
for resistance, and would put forth my last powers in the effort to save myself from the unendurable
trials before me, even if destruction were the consequence.

This is an atom: 
A pistol-ball in my brain would
be preferable to what I saw awaiting me, should Bainrothe succeed in his stratagem, as I doubted
not he would do, if determined on it.

This is an atom: 
I should know freedom in its true sense never again,
if that night were suffered to pass without its redemption, if that belfry once were entered.

This is an atom: 
As carelessly as I could I followed Dinah to the bath-room, ostensibly to direct the temperature
of the water, but really to draw out from her all that was possible while the mood of communication
possessed her, on the subject so vital to me and my welfare.

This is an atom: 
Life and death almost were involved
in her revelations, and I hastened to wind in the clew while it lingered in my hand; for I
knew that she was an eccentric as well as a selfish creature, and might suddenly see fit to
withdraw or snap its thread.

This is an atom: 
"Now, tell me about McDermot, Dinah, what sort of a look has he?

This is an atom: 
Is he large or small, light
or dark, and does he smoke a pipe'?

This is an atom: 
"

"He is a great big man, honey, wid red har an' sort ob chaney-blue eyes; mos while, sometimes
he rolls em up in his head, an' he smells mighty strong of whisky.

This is an atom: 
I tells you all; his bref
mos knocked me down, but I didn't see no pipe?

This is an atom: 
It seemed my only hope to enlist this man
on my side, either through his sympathies or sense of duty.

This is an atom: 
I had no power to command his services
on the side of his avarice.

This is an atom: 
The ring on my finger, the pledge of Wentworth's troth, a massive
circlet of chased gold, was all that remained to me in the shape of valuables.

This is an atom: 
I did not possess
a stiver in that prison, nor own even the clothes on my back.

This is an atom: 
It is his duty, you know, to assist me; it
is on my account, doubtless, he is placed here; and hereafter I can reward him liberally, and
you too.

This is an atom: 
Just now, you know, I am penniless.

This is an atom: 
"

The woman stopped and looked at me, her small black irises mere points, set in extensive, muddy-looking
whites, not unfrequently suffused and bloodshot.

This is an atom: 
"I dun told the ossifer dar wus no one here you knows, answerin' to your perscription.

This is an atom: 
"

"But that was only a measure of safety for yourself; you surely do not mean to take sides with
my persecutors?

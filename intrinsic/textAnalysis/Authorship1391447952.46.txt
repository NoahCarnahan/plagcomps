WIGGS OF THE CABBAGE PATCH

CHAPTER I

MRS.

This is an atom: 
WIGGS'S PHILOSOPHY

    "In the mud and scum of things
    Something always always sings!

This is an atom: 
"

"MY, but it's nice an' cold this mornin'!

This is an atom: 
The thermometer's done
fell up to zero!

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
But, then, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs was a philosopher, and the sum and substance of her philosophy
lay in keeping the dust off her rose-colored spectacles.

This is an atom: 
When Mr.

This is an atom: 
The Wiggses lived in the Cabbage Patch.

This is an atom: 
Mr.

This is an atom: 
Schultz's front room looked directly into the
Eichorns' kitchen.

This is an atom: 
The latter was not a bad arrangement, however,
for Mrs.

This is an atom: 
The Wiggses' house was the most imposing in the neighborhood.

This is an atom: 
So Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs and the boys brought it to
the new home and skilfully placed it at the front end of the side
porch.

This is an atom: 
But the roof gave the house its chief distinction; it was the
only tin roof in the Cabbage Patch.

This is an atom: 
It was Mrs.

This is an atom: 
" Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"

On this particular Sunday morning Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs bustled about the
kitchen in unusual haste.

This is an atom: 
"If there don't come Chris an' Pete a'ready!

This is an atom: 
"

"Why, Asia!

This is an atom: 
" exclaimed Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, "that ain't hospit'le, an' Chris
with one leg, too!

This is an atom: 
'T ain't no trouble at all.

This is an atom: 
"Gee!

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs stood before them with a dilapidated
hymn-book in her hand.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs
began the lesson.

This is an atom: 
" she asked.

This is an atom: 
No response, save a smothered giggle from two of the little girls.

This is an atom: 
"

A hand went up in the corner, and an eager voice cried:

"Yas'm, I know!

This is an atom: 
"

Before Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Mith Wiggs, make Tommy thop thpittin' terbaccer juice in my hat!

This is an atom: 
"

"Teacher, kin I git a drink?

This is an atom: 
" she began, reading from an old lesson-paper.

This is an atom: 
"You kin search me!

This is an atom: 
" promptly answered Chris.

This is an atom: 
"

"No, it's in the Holy Land," she said.

This is an atom: 
A sudden commotion arose in the back of the room.

This is an atom: 
A fight was imminent, but
before any further trouble occurred Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs locked Billy in the
bedroom, and became mistress of the situation.

This is an atom: 
First an' fo'most, I am
goin' to learn you all manners.

This is an atom: 
"

"Don't fuss!

This is an atom: 
" came the prompt answer.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs lifted her hands for silence.

This is an atom: 
"O Lord!

This is an atom: 
" she prayed earnestly, "help these here childern to be good
an' kind to each other, an' to their mas an' their pas.

This is an atom: 
Amen.

This is an atom: 
You ain't gone an' sold it?

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes," said the boy, heavily; "but 't ain't 'nough fer the rent.

This is an atom: 
I
got to figger it out some other way.

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs put her arm about his shoulder, and together they looked
out across the dreary commons.

This is an atom: 
"Don't you worry so, Jimmy," said she.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER II

WAYS AND MEANS

    "Ah!

This is an atom: 
well may the children weep before you!

This is an atom: 
The descent of
the temperature seemed to have a like effect on the barrel of
potatoes and the load of coal in the Wiggses' parlor.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Jim
had a piece of old carpet about him, and coughed with almost every
breath.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"I can't
ast fer credit at Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bagby's; seems like I'd never have the
courage to pull agin a debt.

This is an atom: 
"

Jim's eyes flashed.

This is an atom: 
"Not yet, ma!

This is an atom: 
" he said, firmly.

This is an atom: 
' No, ma!

This is an atom: 
No, I'll
watch the wagon; I'll--"

A knock on the parlor door interrupted her.

This is an atom: 
Jim went to the door.

This is an atom: 
"I've a Christmas basket for you!

This is an atom: 
" cried a cheery voice.

This is an atom: 
"Is this Christmas?

This is an atom: 
" Jim asked dully.

This is an atom: 
The girl in the doorway laughed.

This is an atom: 
The colored man behind her
deposited a large basket on the doorstep.

This is an atom: 
" cried Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"There is one for each of the mission-school families; just a little
Christmas greeting, you know.

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's spirits were rising every minute.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs was a Kentuckian.

This is an atom: 
"

"No.

This is an atom: 
"Have you plenty of
coal?

This is an atom: 
" she asked, in an undertone.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes'm, thank you," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, smiling reassuringly.

This is an atom: 
Her
tone might have been less confident, but for Jim's warning glance.

This is an atom: 
Every fiber of his sensitive nature shrank from asking help.

This is an atom: 
Good night, and a happy
Christmas!

This is an atom: 
Sitting on the floor, they unpacked it.

This is an atom: 
There were
vegetables, oatmeal, fruit, and even tea and coffee.

This is an atom: 
But the
surprise was at the very bottom!

This is an atom: 
"
said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
My, but we'll have a
good dinner to-morrow!

This is an atom: 
Schultz, an'
take a little o' this here tea to ole Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Lawson.

This is an atom: 
"

The cloud had turned inside out for Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, and only the silver
lining was visible.

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's face fell, and she twisted her apron-string in silence.

This is an atom: 
" But one
look at Jim's anxious face recalled their circumstances.

This is an atom: 
"Of course we'll sell it," she said brightly.

This is an atom: 
"You have got the
longest head fer a boy!

This is an atom: 
"

For ten days the basket of provisions and the extra money made by
Jim's night work and Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
" Her voice
broke in a sob.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
At twelve o'clock he
grew restless.

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs got up and went toward the bed.

This is an atom: 
She put her hands over her face, and for a moment dry sobs convulsed
her.

This is an atom: 
I don't
need it a mite, settin' up here so clost to the fire.

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes, Jim.

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, I bin thinking it over.

This is an atom: 
I wouldn't mind her knowin' so much.

This is an atom: 
"

The talking brought on severe coughing, and he sank back exhausted.

This is an atom: 
" asked his mother.

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Want me to tell you 'bout the country, Jim?

This is an atom: 
" she asked.

This is an atom: 
His dim recollection of it all formed his one conception
of heaven.

This is an atom: 
An' yer pa an' me
'ud take you out at the harvestin' time, an' you 'ud play on the
hay-stacks.

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs could tell no more, for the old memories were too much
for her.

This is an atom: 
Birds singin', singin', singin'.

This is an atom: 
"

LATE the next afternoon a man and a girl were standing in the Olcott
reception hall.

This is an atom: 
The fire-light
shining through your hair makes you look like a saint.

This is an atom: 
Little Saint
Lucinda!

This is an atom: 
She put
it behind her for safe-keeping.

This is an atom: 
"Not a saint at all?

This is an atom: 
" he went on, in mock surprise; "then an
iceberg--a nice, proper little iceberg.

This is an atom: 
" he asked.

This is an atom: 
She timidly put her hand on his, and looked up at him earnestly.

This is an atom: 
"It's about Dick Harris," she said.

This is an atom: 
"I wish you would not be with
him so much.

This is an atom: 
"

Redding's face clouded.

This is an atom: 
"You aren't afraid to trust me?

This is an atom: 
" he asked.

This is an atom: 
" he asked.

This is an atom: 
She hesitated.

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, let's hear it, anyway.

This is an atom: 
"

"Well?

This is an atom: 
" said Redding.

This is an atom: 
Lucy evidently found it difficult to continue.

This is an atom: 
Dick Harris and I went to New Orleans straight from college.

This is an atom: 
Poor Dick, he kept on.

This is an atom: 
"But you were never like Dick!

This is an atom: 
" she protested.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," he continued passionately, "and but for God's help I should
be like him still.

This is an atom: 
He sprang forward, but she shrank away.

This is an atom: 
"No, no, don't touch
me!

This is an atom: 
"

"But why should you?

This is an atom: 
" he pleaded.

This is an atom: 
"

The intensity and earnestness of his voice were beginning to
influence her.

This is an atom: 
She looked up through her tears.

This is an atom: 
"

Redding frowned and bit his lip.

This is an atom: 
" he said.

This is an atom: 
" cried Lucy, impatiently.

This is an atom: 
The fire in her eyes had
dried the tears.

This is an atom: 
"He could straighten up if he wanted to.

This is an atom: 
Are you hesitating between us?

This is an atom: 
" she demanded
angrily.

This is an atom: 
He came to Kentucky three months ago, sick and
miserable.

This is an atom: 
"

His words fell on deaf ears.

This is an atom: 
"Then you choose Mr.

This is an atom: 
Harris?

This is an atom: 
"

"Lucy, this is madness; it is not like you in the least!

This is an atom: 
"

The girl was cold with anger and excitement.

This is an atom: 
" She slipped a
ring from her finger, and held it toward him.

This is an atom: 
"Please, ma'am, is this Miss Olcott's?

This is an atom: 
" asked a trembling voice on
the piazza.

This is an atom: 
Lucy did not recognize her.

This is an atom: 
"I will speak to you in a moment," she
said.

This is an atom: 
An awkward pause followed, each waiting for the other to speak.

This is an atom: 
" she asked listlessly.

This is an atom: 
It's Jimmy, ma'am--he's
dead!

This is an atom: 
A week later she sat at her desk bewildered.

This is an atom: 
For seven days she had done
nothing but answer questions and notes, and receive contributions
for the Wiggs family.

This is an atom: 
Money had arrived from all over the State, and
from every class of society.

This is an atom: 
Eichenstine Bros.

This is an atom: 
The few dimes amounted to fifteen dollars.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"I sutenly do feel sorry fer he's maw.

This is an atom: 
"

So it continued.

This is an atom: 
Old and young, rich and poor, paid their
substantial tribute of respect to Jimmy Wiggs.

This is an atom: 
Lucy counted up the long line of figures.

This is an atom: 
"Three hundred and
sixty-five dollars!

This is an atom: 
" she exclaimed; "and food, clothes, and coal
enough to last them a year!

This is an atom: 
The void left in Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"

"My land, Billy!

This is an atom: 
" asked his
mother.

This is an atom: 
"'Cause I knowed you could cure him.

This is an atom: 
' Come on, ma, an' see him!

This is an atom: 
" and Billy hurried
back to his new possession.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs pinned a shawl over her head and ran across the commons.

This is an atom: 
A group of men stood around the writhing animal, but the late owner
had departed.

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, I won't," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, stoutly.

This is an atom: 
"Billy Wiggs's got more
sense than most men I know.

This is an atom: 
"

She stood with her arms on her hips, and critically surveyed her
patient.

This is an atom: 
When Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"This here is a calomel pill," she explained.

This is an atom: 
"I
jes' rolled the calomel in with some soft, light bread.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Gether some sticks an' build a fire quick as you kin.

This is an atom: 
Then she hesitated for
a moment.

This is an atom: 
The kettle of soup was steaming away on the stove ready
for supper.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Now, Billy," she commanded, "put this bucket of tallow down there
in the hottest part of the fire.

This is an atom: 
Look out; don't tip it--there!

This is an atom: 
Now, you come here an' help me pour this soup into the bottle.

This is an atom: 
"

Giving names was one of Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly a thought struck her.

This is an atom: 
We'll call him Cuby!

This is an atom: 
It's a town I
heared 'em talkin' 'bout at the grocery.

This is an atom: 
"

By this time the tallow was melted, and Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Where at?

This is an atom: 
" he asked.

This is an atom: 
"Right here!

This is an atom: 
"Why, shucks, 't ain't nothin' but a hoss!

This is an atom: 
" demanded Miss Hazy.

This is an atom: 
Chris was not prepared to say.

This is an atom: 
All through breakfast Miss Hazy was in a flutter of excitement.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs coming across the yard carrying a bucket.

This is an atom: 
She hastened to
meet her.

This is an atom: 
"Mornin'," called Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, brightly, in spite of her night's
vigil; "ain't we got a fine hoss?

This is an atom: 
Wiggs made explanations, and
called attention to Cuba's fine points.

This is an atom: 
"Can't you come in an' take a warm?

This is an atom: 
Wiggs.

This is an atom: 
"I ain't been over fer
quite a spell.

This is an atom: 
The childern kin clean up, bein' it's Saturday.

This is an atom: 
"
From seven to nine in the morning were the favorite calling-hours in
the Cabbage Patch.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"

"My!

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes," continued Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, "we was--up to the time of the fire.

This is an atom: 
"It was this a-way," went on Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, drawing her chair closer to
the fire, and preparing for a good, long talk.

This is an atom: 
Course Jim
said he'd do it.

This is an atom: 
Poor Jim, always ready to do the hard part!

This is an atom: 
"Never min', Miss Wiggs; don't cry.

This is an atom: 
"

"Well," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
" exclaimed Miss Hazy.

This is an atom: 
White's 'bout
nightfall.

This is an atom: 
"

"Dr.

This is an atom: 
White was your old doctor, wasn't he?

This is an atom: 
" prompted Miss Hazy.

This is an atom: 
"Yes'm.

This is an atom: 
He used to tend Mr.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs before we moved over into Bullitt
County.

This is an atom: 
You know Mr.

This is an atom: 
He
had head trouble.

This is an atom: 
He uster go into reg'lar transoms!

This is an atom: 
"

Miss Hazy was awe-struck, but more dreadful revelations were to
follow.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, calmly.

This is an atom: 
"The
doctor an' ever'body said so.

This is an atom: 
He was a wonderful man!

This is an atom: 
Kept his senses
plumb to the end.

This is an atom: 
I remember his very las' words.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs!

This is an atom: 
I ain't never died before.

This is an atom: 
' An' them was the very las' words he ever
spoke.

This is an atom: 
"

"Was he a church member, Miss Wiggs?

This is an atom: 
" inquired Miss Hazy.

This is an atom: 
"Well, no, not exactly," admitted Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, reluctantly.

This is an atom: 
6 Injun House, an' then you ast fer Pete Jenkins.

This is an atom: 
White's.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
It's little Jimmy Wiggs, all the
way from Curryville!

This is an atom: 
'

"Then they give him his supper, an' Mrs.

This is an atom: 
White sez: 'Where'll he
sleep at, Doctor?

This is an atom: 
There ain't no spare bed.

This is an atom: 
' Then Jim sez the doctor
frowned like ever'thin', an' sez: 'Sleep?

This is an atom: 
"Early the nex' mornin' he started out agin, the doctor pointin' him
on the way.

This is an atom: 
All of a suddint a
ice-wagon come rattlin' up behin' him.

This is an atom: 
" called a shrill voice from the Wiggses' porch, "Australia's
in the rain-barrel!

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs looked exasperated.

This is an atom: 
"Ther' ain't much more," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, picking up her bucket.

This is an atom: 
"Our hoss had two legs an' his neck broke, but Jim never had a
scratch.

This is an atom: 
A policeman took him to No.

This is an atom: 
"

"Ma!

This is an atom: 
" again came the warning cry across the yard.

This is an atom: 
"All right, I'm comin'!

This is an atom: 
Good-by, Miss Hazy; you have a eye to Cuby
till we git our shed ready.

This is an atom: 
"

And, with a cordial hand-shake, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs went cheerfully away to
administer chastisement to her erring offspring.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VI

A THEATER PARTY

    "The play, the play's the thing!

This is an atom: 
But it took them all, besides Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's earnings, to keep the family from the awful calamity of
"pulling agin a debt.

This is an atom: 
" he asked.

This is an atom: 
I'd jes' give anythin' to see the show
at the Opery House this week.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, 't is, Billy Wiggs," answered his mother, impressively.

This is an atom: 
"You
ain't never been inside a theayter, an' I have.

This is an atom: 
I was there twict,
an' it was grand!

This is an atom: 
You orter see the lights an' fixin's, an' all the
fine ladies an' their beaus.

This is an atom: 
First time I went they was a man in
skin-tights a-walkin' on a rope h'isted 'way up over ever'body's
head.

This is an atom: 
" asked Billy, thrilled in spite of himself.

This is an atom: 
"It's spangles 'round yer waist, an' shoes without no heels to 'em.

This is an atom: 
It's jes' grand, I tell you!

This is an atom: 
Finally he said: "You might take my
snow-money from las' week.

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs was indignant.

This is an atom: 
"Why, Billy Wiggs!

This is an atom: 
"Some kindlin', sir?

This is an atom: 
"

The gentleman shook his head.

This is an atom: 
The posters still danced before
Billy's eyes; if his mother could only see the show!

This is an atom: 
The last chance
seemed slipping away.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly a bold idea presented itself.

This is an atom: 
He got
out of the wagon, and came up on the step.

This is an atom: 
"

The man looked puzzled.

This is an atom: 
"Take it out in tickets?

This is an atom: 
" he repeated.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, sir," said Billy, "theayter tickets.

This is an atom: 
Don't you own the show?

This is an atom: 
"

The gentleman laughed.

This is an atom: 
"Well, hardly," he said.

This is an atom: 
" he asked, in
conclusion.

This is an atom: 
The gentleman made a hurried calculation.

This is an atom: 
"You say you have three
sisters?

This is an atom: 
" he asked.

This is an atom: 
"Yep," said Billy.

This is an atom: 
"

"Gee whiz!

This is an atom: 
Billy's face fell instantly.

This is an atom: 
"

"But I don't need the kindling; haven't any place to put it.

This is an atom: 
"

"Ain't you got no home?

This is an atom: 
" asked Billy, incredulously.

This is an atom: 
"No," answered the man, shortly.

This is an atom: 
The idea of any one, in any walk of life, not having use for
kindling was a new one to Billy.

This is an atom: 
"Ain't there nobody you could give it to?

This is an atom: 
" he asked.

This is an atom: 
The gentleman was growing impatient.

This is an atom: 
"
he inquired.

This is an atom: 
"Well, Miss Hazy, not having the pleasure of my acquaintance, might
object to the delicate attention.

This is an atom: 
"

"She's Chris's aunt; they ain't had no fire fer two days.

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh!

This is an atom: 
" said the man, heartily, "take it to Miss Hazy, by all means.

This is an atom: 
Tell her it's from Mr.

This is an atom: 
"

An hour later there was wild excitement under the only tin roof in
the Cabbage Patch.

This is an atom: 
"It's jes' like a peetrified air-castle," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs carefully ironed out five
plaits on each head.

This is an atom: 
"Now, Billy, you run over to Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Eichorn's an' ast her to loan me
her black crepe veil.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
" Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Australia had thrown the hair-brush down
the cistern the summer before.

This is an atom: 
"Asia, you go git the alpaca from behind the chest, an' sorter shake
it out on the bed.

This is an atom: 
"Well, now, I don't know," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, critically surveying the
children; "it won't button good on you, and swags in the back on
Australia.

This is an atom: 
"

"Lemme wear it, ma!

This is an atom: 
"

"No, lemme!

This is an atom: 
" came in excited tones.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Asia, you kin wear the skirt, an' Austry kin wear
the waist.

This is an atom: 
"

Just here Billy came in, with the veil in one hand and a bunch of
faded carnations in the other.

This is an atom: 
"Look, ma!

This is an atom: 
He got 'em outen a ash-barrel over on
the avenue.

This is an atom: 
" said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs; "I'll jes' clip the
stems an' put 'em in a bottle of water, an' they'll pick up right
smart by the time we go.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs was
rummaging in the table drawer.

This is an atom: 
Bender.

This is an atom: 
Seems to me they do wear white gloves to the theayter, but I
disremember.

This is an atom: 
"

"Naw!

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs continued her search.

This is an atom: 
" So it was decided, and Billy wore the comforter.

This is an atom: 
"Some of you all shake down the stove an' pull the door to fer me.

This is an atom: 
Eichorn's veil I'm 'fraid to
turn my head," Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs stopped suddenly.

This is an atom: 
"Fer the land's sakes alive!

This is an atom: 
"

At this Australia began to cry, and a gloom settled upon the party.

This is an atom: 
"
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Looks like a chromo ma used to have.

This is an atom: 
"

But the young Wiggses were in no frame of mind to appreciate the
picturesqueness of the scene.

This is an atom: 
By and by Australia's sobs began anew.

This is an atom: 
"

"I want my supper!

This is an atom: 
" wailed Australia.

This is an atom: 
Then it dawned on Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Well, if that don't beat all!

This is an atom: 
" said she.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VII

"MR.

This is an atom: 
" The Opera House was a blaze of light
and color.

This is an atom: 
From the recesses of one of the boxes, Redding made a careful survey
of the faces beneath him.

This is an atom: 
First nights usually found him there, with
the same restless, eager look in his eyes.

This is an atom: 
Then he
deliberately turned his back on "The Greatest Extravaganza of the
Century," and centered his attention on the parquet group.

This is an atom: 
It was a singularly enthusiastic theater party, oblivious of
surroundings, and lost in wonder at the strange sights.

This is an atom: 
Billy's
laugh rang out frequently, with refreshing spontaneity.

This is an atom: 
He hastened to the lobby, and touched Billy on the
shoulder.

This is an atom: 
"Didn't you like the show?

This is an atom: 
" he asked.

This is an atom: 
"You bet!

This is an atom: 
" said Billy, his eyes shining and his cheeks flushed.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Bob, Billy's friend.

This is an atom: 
Happy to meet yer
acquaintance.

This is an atom: 
Asia, speak to the gentleman--Australia--
Europena!

This is an atom: 
" with a commanding nod at each.

This is an atom: 
Three small hands were thrust at Redding simultaneously, and he
accommodated them all in his broad palm.

This is an atom: 
" he asked, looking from one to the
other.

This is an atom: 
" asked Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, in amazement.

This is an atom: 
"

"Is there some more, ma?

This is an atom: 
" asked Asia, eagerly.

This is an atom: 
"

So back they went, furnishing an amusing entr'acte for the impatient
audience.

This is an atom: 
They seemed dazed
by their recent glimpse into fairy-land.

This is an atom: 
Something in their thin
bodies and pinched faces made Redding form a sudden resolve.

This is an atom: 
"Billy," he said gravely, "can't you and your family take supper
with me?

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
" and Billy
was already casting longing eyes at the big restaurant across the
way.

This is an atom: 
She had not the heart to refuse.

This is an atom: 
She seen
us!

This is an atom: 
Look!

This is an atom: 
"

But before they could turn the carriage door had slammed.

This is an atom: 
"

Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob laughed.

This is an atom: 
"Why, you little cannibal!

This is an atom: 
" he said.

This is an atom: 
"

"Cream puffs," explained Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, airily.

This is an atom: 
"She et 'em onct at
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Reed's, the Bourbon Stock Yard's wife, an' she's been talkin'
'bout 'em ever sence.

This is an atom: 
"For speed and durability
they break the record," was his mental comment.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs became communicative.

This is an atom: 
He's built his pa a monumint!

This is an atom: 
"

"A monument!

This is an atom: 
" exclaimed Redding.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, sir, a tombstun monumint!

This is an atom: 
Well,
he kep' on gittin' 'em ever' day or two, till he had a consider'ble
pile.

This is an atom: 
Gone, but not forgotten.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's grave.

This is an atom: 
Such a
wail as arose!

This is an atom: 
"I'd leave her be, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob," advised Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Billy," said Redding, taking Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"

"I'd like it a heap," answered Billy, promptly.

This is an atom: 
Redding turned to Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs.

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh, yes," answered Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, complacently; "there wouldn't be no
trouble 'bout Billy promotin'.

This is an atom: 
He's jes'
like his pa--the very spittin' image of him!

This is an atom: 
Mr.

This is an atom: 
"

"I'm goin' to be like Mr.

This is an atom: 
"
No answer.

This is an atom: 
Bob's knee.

This is an atom: 
Then he rang for
a carriage, and, in spite of Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"My, my, ain't this nice!

This is an atom: 
" said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Lemme ride up on top, ma!

This is an atom: 
" demanded Billy, eagerly.

This is an atom: 
"Lemme, too, lemme!

This is an atom: 
"All right, Billy; but, Austry, you must stay with ma.

This is an atom: 
Good-by, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob, and thanks--thanks fer one an' all!

This is an atom: 
For a moment he
stood irresolute.

This is an atom: 
" He ran
lightly across the street, and up the broad stone steps.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VIII

MRS.

This is an atom: 
"

ON Christmas day Lucy Olcott stood by the library window, and idly
scratched initials on the frosty pane.

This is an atom: 
A table full of beautiful
gifts stood near, and a great bunch of long-stemmed roses on the
piano filled the room with fragrance.

This is an atom: 
But Lucy evidently found
something more congenial in the dreary view outside.

This is an atom: 
Lucy opened the note and read: "Dear miss Lucy the basket of cloths
and vittles come.

This is an atom: 
We or so mutch obliged, and asia wore the read
dress to the soshul and enjoyed her selph so.

This is an atom: 
Much I wish you could
a went.

This is an atom: 
Billy liked his hock and ladar and romcandons.

This is an atom: 
They is pertaters 2 kines, onions, termaters, a jar
vineger and a jar perservs.

This is an atom: 
Hope you will
Enjoy them.

This is an atom: 
I send some of all we got but Cole and Flower.

This is an atom: 
Thankes
thankes to you for your kind fealings.

This is an atom: 
"From yours no more "MRS.

This is an atom: 
WIGGS.

This is an atom: 
"

"Bless her old heart!

This is an atom: 
Put the basket there with my other presents, Aunt Chloe;
it's worth them all.

This is an atom: 
"I wish it was night," she said.

This is an atom: 
"I hate Christmas afternoon!

This is an atom: 
I believe I'll go down to
the Cabbage Patch.

This is an atom: 
"Don' you do it, honey.

This is an atom: 
"

"Bother the old party!

This is an atom: 
" said Lucy, impatiently.

This is an atom: 
Billy
let himself down from the chicken-coop roof, and ran forward.

This is an atom: 
"Them Roman candles wasn't no good!

This is an atom: 
" he cried.

This is an atom: 
"One of 'em busted
too soon, and 'most blowed my hand off.

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh, no, it didn't, Miss Lucy!

This is an atom: 
" said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Them Roman candons was fine.

This is an atom: 
Come right in," she continued.

This is an atom: 
"Asia, dust
off a cheer fer Miss Lucy.

This is an atom: 
"

"Lemme hold the muff!

This is an atom: 
" cried Australia.

This is an atom: 
"No, me--me!

This is an atom: 
" shrieked Europena.

This is an atom: 
The umpire interfered.

This is an atom: 
"Australia Wiggs, you go set in the corner with yer face to the
wall.

This is an atom: 
Europena, come here!

This is an atom: 
" She lifted the wailing little girl to
her lap, and looked her sternly in the eye.

This is an atom: 
"If you don't hush this
minute, I'll spank your doll!

This is an atom: 
"

The awful threat was sufficient.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"We had a grand dinner to-day," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, following her
glance.

This is an atom: 
"Mr.

This is an atom: 
This
taciturn little girl, with her old, solemn face and clever fingers,
was her favorite of the children.

This is an atom: 
"She's paintin' a picture," announced Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, proudly.

This is an atom: 
Well, anyway, I couldn't
git it, but I come home an' got me three tin cans an' took 'em
'round to Mr.

This is an atom: 
Asia's painted a heap with it.

This is an atom: 
I'll show you some of her
things.

This is an atom: 
"It's perfectly wonderful!

This is an atom: 
" said Lucy, with entire truthfulness.

This is an atom: 
"Ain't it?

This is an atom: 
" said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, with the awed tone one uses in the
presence of genius.

This is an atom: 
They inherit their education after Mr.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs; he was so smart, an' b'longed to such a fine fambly.

This is an atom: 
Why, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs had real Injun blood in his veins; his grandpa was a squaw--
a full-blood Injun squaw!

This is an atom: 
"Oh, my, no!

This is an atom: 
" continued Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs.

This is an atom: 
"He was a blunette, real dark
complected.

This is an atom: 
Pa wasn't to say well off in those days.

This is an atom: 
" Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs
never applied superlatives to misfortunes.

This is an atom: 
"He had a good many of us
to take keer of, an' after Mr.

This is an atom: 
'Mr.

This is an atom: 
Ef you don't mind,' sez he, 'I'll jes' put this
wagon-load of fuel in the coal-house.

This is an atom: 
' An' I was!

This is an atom: 
" added Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, laughing.

This is an atom: 
Ordinarily Lucy found endless diversion in listening to the family
reminiscences, but to-day another subject was on her mind.

This is an atom: 
" she asked.

This is an atom: 
"Jes' fine!

This is an atom: 
" said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs; "only he comes home at night 'most
dead.

This is an atom: 
" Lucy blushed at her subterfuge.

This is an atom: 
"Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
He's got money.

This is an atom: 
Asia said he give the nigger waiter a
quarter.

This is an atom: 
Billy is jes' crazy 'bout Mr.

This is an atom: 
He will, too, if he sets his head to
it!

This is an atom: 
Only he never kin have them big brown eyes an' white teeth Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob's got.

This is an atom: 
Bob smiles it jes' sort of breaks up his
whole face.

This is an atom: 
"I jes' wish you could see him!

This is an atom: 
" went on Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs,
enthusiastically.

This is an atom: 
"I wish I could!

This is an atom: 
Wiggs paused
on her way to answer a knock at the outside door.

This is an atom: 
There was a scraping of feet in the passage.

This is an atom: 
"I have some Christmas traps for the kids.

This is an atom: 
"Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob, this is Miss Lucy," announced Mrs.

This is an atom: 
But to Lucy it was a moment of intense chagrin and embarrassment.

This is an atom: 
To be thrust upon him in this
way was intolerable.

This is an atom: 
All the blood in her veins rushed to her face.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs?

This is an atom: 
" she asked, after a
formal greeting.

This is an atom: 
"Oh!

This is an atom: 
you ain't a-goin'?

This is an atom: 
" asked the hostess, anxiously.

This is an atom: 
"I wanted you
all to git acquainted.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs searched
for the lost property.

This is an atom: 
"I ain't!

This is an atom: 
Wiggs dragged
forth the culprit, and restored the muff.

This is an atom: 
"May I drive you over to the avenue?

This is an atom: 
"Oh, no!

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs stood watching the scene in perplexity.

This is an atom: 
One afternoon Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs stood at her gate talking to Redding.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, indeed, Billy kin go," Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs was saying.

This is an atom: 
He never was to
the fair grounds before; it'll be a big treat.

This is an atom: 
Dick
to-day?

This is an atom: 
"

"No better," said Redding; "he coughed all night.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, "so I didn't disturb him.

This is an atom: 
He ain't fer long, pore
feller!

This is an atom: 
"

"No, poor chap," said Redding, sadly.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
" she asked.

This is an atom: 
"What about it?

This is an atom: 
"

"She done it herself," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs.

This is an atom: 
"That an' the pavement, too.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Krasmier's goat et up her flowers las' year, an' this year she
'lowed she'd fix it different.

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, she is pretty clever!

This is an atom: 
"

"Fourteen, goin' on to fifteen.

This is an atom: 
Asia, come here.

This is an atom: 
"Not a very big girl, are you?

This is an atom: 
" said Redding, smiling at her.

This is an atom: 
Could I?

This is an atom: 
"

Before Redding could answer, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs broke in:

"You'd be gittin' a artist, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob!

This is an atom: 
Them fingers of hers kin do
anything.

This is an atom: 
And
talk about mud pictures!

This is an atom: 
"

Billy's appearance at this moment saved Redding from immediate
disgrace.

This is an atom: 
Yer pa was a fine mason; it would be a sort of
compliment to him.

This is an atom: 
" asked Asia.

This is an atom: 
"Well, now I ain't right sure whether it 'a got five points or six.

This is an atom: 
Either way will do.

This is an atom: 
"

Lucy Olcott had been a frequent visitor of late.

This is an atom: 
Through Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs
she had gotten interested in Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Schultz, and often stopped in to
read to the bedridden old lady.

This is an atom: 
Schultz's
life.

This is an atom: 
In fact, Lucy became an important personage in the neighborhood.

This is an atom: 
"Didn't you meet Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob up the street?

This is an atom: 
" asked Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Him an' Billy have jes' left, goin'
out to the fair grounds.

This is an atom: 
Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob's jes' naturally the best man I
ever set eyes on, Miss Lucy!

This is an atom: 
Got the biggest heart, an' always doin'
something kind fer folks.

This is an atom: 
Jes' now talkin' 'bout gittin' Asia a
place at the tile fact'ry.

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh, yes, he would!

This is an atom: 
" said Lucy, emphatically.

This is an atom: 
"My roses don't appeal
to Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob.

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, he likes yer eyes, anyway," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, determined to
carry her point.

This is an atom: 
" demanded Lucy.

This is an atom: 
"He did.

This is an atom: 
I ast him.

This is an atom: 
"Don't you ever worry over things?

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs grew serious.

This is an atom: 
"I'm lonesome fer Jimmy all the time," she
said simply.

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, yes," admitted Mrs.

This is an atom: 
All one night I laid there with my head 'most
bustin', jes' worryin' 'bout it.

This is an atom: 
" There was absolute
conviction in her tone and manner.

This is an atom: 
"Nex' mornin'," she went on,
"soon's I could I went over to the 'spensary an' ast fer the chief
doctor.

This is an atom: 
"'Doctor,' I sez, 'don't you buy corpses?

This is an atom: 
'

"'Yes,' sez he, lookin' kinder funny.

This is an atom: 
"'Well,' sez I, 'I want to sell mine.

This is an atom: 
"'Will you put it in writin',' sez he.

This is an atom: 
"'Yes,' sez I, 'if you'll do the same.

This is an atom: 
So you
see," concluded Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"

Lucy laughed.

This is an atom: 
"

"Not always," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs.

This is an atom: 
T'words the last he uster pretty often--" Here
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs tipped an imaginary bottle to her lips, and gave Lucy a
significant wink.

This is an atom: 
Even in the strictest confidence, she could not
bear to speak of the weakness of the late lamented.

This is an atom: 
Mr.

This is an atom: 
Dick sorter puts me in mind of him 'bout that.

This is an atom: 
Dick?

This is an atom: 
"

"He's Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob's friend.

This is an atom: 
Stays at his rooms sence he was took down.

This is an atom: 
"

"Is Mr.

This is an atom: 
Redding sick?

This is an atom: 
" asked Lucy, the color suddenly leaving her
face.

This is an atom: 
"No, it's Mr.

This is an atom: 
Dick; he's consumpted.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs done.

This is an atom: 
'I'm on the water-cart,' sez he.

This is an atom: 
'Bob's drivin' it.

This is an atom: 
' He ain't no fatter 'n a knittin'-needle, an'
weaker 'n water.

This is an atom: 
Bob!

This is an atom: 
An' when Mr.

This is an atom: 
He ain't got no folks nor nothin'--
jes, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob.

This is an atom: 
He shorely does set store by him--jes' shows it
ever' way.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, with a new tenderness in her face.

This is an atom: 
" she said impulsively.

This is an atom: 
"You are
one of the best and happiest women I know.

This is an atom: 
I'll be
fifty years old on the Fourth of July, but I hold there ain't no use
in dyin' 'fore yer time.

This is an atom: 
"

Lucy sat silent for a while, gazing out of the window.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's
philosophy was having its effect.

This is an atom: 
Presently she rose and untied the
bundle she held.

This is an atom: 
"Umph, umph!

This is an atom: 
Ain't that grand?

This is an atom: 
" exclaimed Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, coming from
behind the ironing-board to examine it.

This is an atom: 
Oh, must you go?

This is an atom: 
"Yes; I promised Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Schultz to read to her this afternoon.

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, stop in on yer way back--I'll have a little present ready
for you.

This is an atom: 
"
said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"If I wasn't so stove
up, an' nobody wasn't lookin', I'd jes' skitter 'round this here
yard like a colt!

This is an atom: 
"

THROUGH the long, sunny afternoon Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs sang over her ironing,
and Asia worked diligently in her flower-bed.

This is an atom: 
"Wish we could make some white cakes, like they have at Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bagby's," said Europena.

This is an atom: 
"Could if we had some whitewash.

This is an atom: 
Let
's take some of Asia's paint she's goin' to paint the fence with,
an' make 'em green on top.

This is an atom: 
"

"Ma wouldn't like it," protested Europena; "besides, I don't want
my little pies green.

This is an atom: 
"

"I'm goin' to," said Australia, beginning her search for the
paint-can.

This is an atom: 
"It won't take but a little teeny bit; they'll never
miss it.

This is an atom: 
Its high position enhanced its value, giving it the cruel
fascination of the unattainable.

This is an atom: 
"Could you stand up on my soldiers, like the man at the show?

This is an atom: 
"
demanded Australia.

This is an atom: 
"I'd fall off," said Europena.

This is an atom: 
"'Fraid-cat!

This is an atom: 
" taunted her sister, in disgust.

This is an atom: 
"

"It ain't got no bottom.

This is an atom: 
Leaders of great enterprises must of
necessity turn deaf ears to words of discouragement.

This is an atom: 
"'T wouldn't matter," said Australia, loftily; "'t wouldn't be but
the seventh time.

This is an atom: 
I got three more times to die.

This is an atom: 
"Now, you lay 'crost the chair, Europena, an' I'll climb up," she
commanded.

This is an atom: 
She valiantly braced her small
body across the frame of the chair, and Australia began her perilous
ascent.

This is an atom: 
"I 've 'most got it!

This is an atom: 
Redding was the first to the rescue.

This is an atom: 
"There, there, little sister, you aren't much hurt!

This is an atom: 
Wiggs and Asia rushed in.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs constituted
herself a salvage corps.

This is an atom: 
"Take off yer coat out here, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob, an' I'll take off Austry's
dress.

This is an atom: 
Them's the worst, 'ceptin' her plaits.

This is an atom: 
Involuntarily, Lucy looked at Redding for explanation, and they both
laughed.

This is an atom: 
"Ain't it lucky it was the back of her head 'stid of the front?

This is an atom: 
"
said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Pore
chile, she looks like a Mollygraw!

This is an atom: 
Come right in, an' let's git to
work.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs to make his coat presentable.

This is an atom: 
"All right," Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs said promptly.

This is an atom: 
"Whatever you say is all
right.

This is an atom: 
"

But Australia felt differently; her sobs, suppressed for a time,
broke forth afresh.

This is an atom: 
" she wept.

This is an atom: 
"Jes' leave it on
this a-way.

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs commanded and Lucy entreated in vain.

This is an atom: 
Finally Redding
drew his chair up in front of the small girl.

This is an atom: 
"Australia, listen to me just a moment, won't you?

This is an atom: 
Please!

This is an atom: 
"

She uncovered one eye.

This is an atom: 
"You wouldn't want green hair, would you?

This is an atom: 
"

A violent shake of the head.

This is an atom: 
"

Such munificence was not to be withstood.

This is an atom: 
"You orter been a hoss-trainer, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob," said Mrs.

This is an atom:

"Not everybody, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs," he said grimly.

This is an atom: 
Oh, you ain't
goin' to try an' wear it this a-way?

This is an atom: 
Lucy
unfastened the violets at her belt, and timidly held them toward
him.

This is an atom: 
"Will you take them--to Dick?

This is an atom: 
" she faltered.

This is an atom: 
He looked at her in amazement.

This is an atom: 
"Well, it certainly do beat me!

This is an atom: 
" she exclaimed, after a fruitless
effort to reconstruct her standard of propriety.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs threw up her hands in horror.

This is an atom: 
"Good lands, Billy!

This is an atom: 
"

"They 're bringin' him up the railroad track.

This is an atom: 
"

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs rushed into the house.

This is an atom: 
"Pore chile!

This is an atom: 
I'll run
down the track an' meet 'em.

This is an atom: 
Schultz's.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs turned upon Billy;

"I never lied, ma!

This is an atom: 
Oh, boys!

This is an atom: 
Git on to the rags an' arniky!

This is an atom: 
"

Such a shout went up that Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"It's his peg-stick!

This is an atom: 
" she shouted.

This is an atom: 
"P-e-g-stick!

This is an atom: 
"

This information, instead of bringing relief to Miss Hazy, caused a
fresh burst of tears.

This is an atom: 
She sat down on the track, with her apron over
her face, and swayed backward and forward.

This is an atom: 
Miss Hazy's
arrival had changed their point of view.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs rose to the occasion.

This is an atom: 
Let's give a benefit dance to-night, an' buy
Chris Hazy a new peg-stick.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs.

This is an atom: 
" asked Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, le' 's bring 'em ourselves!

This is an atom: 
By noon the boys reported most of the tickets sold, and Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs effected a compromise.

This is an atom: 
"I got a Japanee lantern," suggested Miss Hazy, doubtfully.

This is an atom: 
"The very thing!

This is an atom: 
" said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs.

This is an atom: 
"We'll hang it in the front
door.

This is an atom: 
Billy's makin' a Jack o' lantern to set on the fence.

This is an atom: 
Fer the
land's sake!

This is an atom: 
"It's fer you," he said, grinning broadly.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, and Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs thought he
looked at Miss Hazy.

This is an atom: 
However, the card on the freezer dispelled all doubt: "Fer mrs Wiggs
on her 50 Birthday compelments of The Naybors.

This is an atom: 
"

Under the white paper was a large, white iced cake, with a "W" in
cinnamon drops on top.

This is an atom: 
" exclaimed Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, in
delight.

This is an atom: 
We'll have the cake fer
the party to-night.

This is an atom: 
"Where's Europena?

This is an atom: 
" asked Asia.

This is an atom: 
Nobody had seen her for some time.

This is an atom: 
Fingers and mouth
were crimson, and the first stroke of the "W" was missing.

This is an atom: 
"No, I ain't a-goin' to whip her on my birthday, Billy.

This is an atom: 
She's
sorry; she says she is.

This is an atom:

The first guest to arrive was Mr.

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Half the spectators had arrived before the hostess appeared.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

Bagby.

the window with Chris Hazy, and delightedly clapped time to the
music.

This is an atom: 
When Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Howdy, Mr.

Bob; howdy, Miss Lucy!

This is an atom: 
Can't you git right out an' come

This is an atom: 
We 're havin' a birthday party an' a benefit dance fer Chris

Wiggs's head.

This is an atom: 
"We just stopped by to tell you the good news.

"'Bout Asia's position?

" asked Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, eagerly.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, about that, and something else besides.

This is an atom: 
" gasped Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, more breathless than
ever.

This is an atom: 
Then the truth flashed upon her, and she laughed with them.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, sure 'nough!

Sure 'nough!

PLAGIARIZED ATOMS: 

------------------------------------------------------------
This is an atom: 
Wiggs made the statement as cheerfully as if her elbows were
not sticking out through the boy's coat that she wore, or her teeth
chattering in her head like a pair of castanets.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs traveled to eternity by the alcohol route, she buried his
faults with him, and for want of better virtues to extol she always
laid stress on the fine hand he wrote.

This is an atom: 
It was the same way when
their little country home burned and she had to come to the city to
seek work; her one comment was: "Thank God, it was the pig instid of
the baby that was burned!

This is an atom: 
"

So this bleak morning in December she pinned the bed-clothes around
the children and made them sit up close to the stove, while she
pasted brown paper over the broken window-pane and made sprightly
comments on the change in the weather.

This is an atom: 
It was not a real cabbage
patch, but a queer neighborhood, where ramshackle cottages played
hop-scotch over the railroad tracks.

This is an atom: 
There were no streets, so when
a new house was built the owner faced it any way his fancy prompted.

This is an atom: 
Bagby's grocery, it is true, conformed to convention, and
presented a solid front to the railroad track, but Miss Hazy's
cottage shied off sidewise into the Wiggses' yard, as if it were
afraid of the big freight-trains that went thundering past so many
times a day; and Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Schultz had been confined to her bed for ten years, and her
sole interest in life consisted in watching what took place in her
neighbor's family.

This is an atom: 
This
was probably due to the fact that it had two front doors and a tin
roof.

This is an atom: 
One door was nailed up, and the other opened outdoors, but you
would never guess it from the street.

This is an atom: 
When the country house burned,
one door had been saved.

This is an atom: 
Jim and Billy had made it of old
cans which they picked up on the commons.

This is an atom: 
Jim was fifteen and head of the family; his shoulders were those of
a man, and were bent with work, but his body dwindled away to a pair
of thin legs that seemed incapable of supporting the burden imposed
upon them.

This is an atom: 
In his anxious eyes was the look of a bread-winner who
had begun the struggle too soon.

This is an atom: 
Life had been a tragedy to Jim: the
tragedy that comes when a child's sensitive soul is forced to meet
the responsibilities of manhood, yet lacks the wisdom that only
experience can bring.

This is an atom: 
Billy Wiggs was differently constituted; responsibilities rested
upon him as lightly as the freckles on his nose.

This is an atom: 
When occasion or
his mother demanded he worked to good purposes with a tenacity that
argued well for his future success, but for the most part he played
and fought and got into trouble with the aptitude characteristic of
the average small boy.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's boast that her three little girls had geography
names; first came Asia, then Australia.

This is an atom: 
When the last baby arrived,
Billy had stood looking down at the small bundle and asked
anxiously: "Are you goin' to have it fer a boy or a girl, ma?

This is an atom: 
Wiggs had answered: "A girl, Billy, an' her name's Europena!

This is an atom: 
"I am goin' to make you all some nice Irish pertater soup fer
dinner," she said, as she came in from the parlor, where she kept
her potatoes and onions.

This is an atom: 
"The boys'll be in soon, an' we'll have
to hurry and git through 'fore the childern begin to come to
Sunday-school.

This is an atom: 
"

For many years Sunday afternoon had been a trying time in the
neighborhood, so Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs had organized a Sunday-school class at
which she presided.

This is an atom: 
" said Asia, from her
post by the stove; "I bet they've had their dinner, an' jes' come
early to git some of ours!

This is an atom: 
All I got to do is to
put a little more water in the soup, an' me and Jim won't take but
one piece of bread.

This is an atom: 
"

When Jim and Billy came in they found their places at the table
taken, so they sat on the floor and drank their soup out of tea-
cups.

This is an atom: 
" said Billy, after the third help, "I've drinken so much that
when I swallers a piece er bread I can hear it splash!

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, you boys git up now, an' go out and bring me in a couple of
planks to put acrost the cheers fer the childern to set on.

This is an atom: 
"

By two o 'clock the Sunday-school had begun; every seat in the
kitchen, available and otherwise, was occupied.

This is an atom: 
The boys sat in the
windows and on the table, and the girls squeezed together on the
improvised benches.

This is an atom: 
"Now, you all must hush talking so we kin all sing a hymn; I'll
read it over, then we'll all sing it together.

This is an atom: 
'When upon life's billers you are tempest tossed,
    When you are discouraged thinking all is lost,
    Count yer many blessin's, name 'em one by one,
    An' it will surprise you what the Lord hath done!

This is an atom: 
'"

Clear and strong rose the childish voices in different keys and
regardless of time, but with a genuine enthusiasm that was in itself
a blessing.

This is an atom: 
When they had sung through the three stanzas Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"What did we study 'bout last Sunday?

This is an atom: 
"Don't you all remember what the Lord give Moses up on the
mountain?

This is an atom: 
Lord give Moses ten tallers, an' he duveled 'em.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs could enter into an argument concerning this new
version of sacred history, she was hit in the eye with a paper wad.

This is an atom: 
It was aimed at Billy, but when he dodged she became the victim.

This is an atom: 
This caused some delay, for she had to bathe the injured member, and
during the interval the Sunday-school became riotous.

This is an atom: 
"

"Miss Wiggs, I know who hit you!

This is an atom: 
"

It was not until Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, with a stocking tied over her eye,
emerged from the bedroom and again took command that order was
restored.

This is an atom: 
"Where is Bethlehem?

This is an atom: 
She ignored his remark, and passed to the next, who said, half
doubtfully:

"Ain't it in Alabama?

This is an atom: 
Billy, by a series
of skilful manoeuvers, had succeeded in removing the chair that held
one of the planks, and a cascade of small, indignant girls were
tobogganing sidewise down the incline.

This is an atom: 
"What I think you childern need is a talk about fussin' an'
fightin'.

This is an atom: 
There ain't no use in me teachin' what they done a
thousand years ago, when you ain't got manners enough to listen at
what I am sayin'.

This is an atom: 
I recollect one time durin' the war, when the
soldiers was layin' 'round the camp, tryin' they best to keep from
freezin' to death, a preacher come 'long to hold a service.

This is an atom: 
An' when
he got up to preach he sez, 'Friends,' sez he, 'my tex' is
Chillblains.

This is an atom: 
They ain't no use a-preachin' religion to men whose
whole thought is set on their feet.

This is an atom: 
Now, you fellows git some
soft-soap an' pour it in yer shoes, an' jes' keep them shoes on till
yer feet gits well, an' the nex' time I come 'round yer minds'll be
better prepared to receive the word of the Lord.

This is an atom: 
' Now, that's the
way I feel 'bout this here Sunday-school.

This is an atom: 
Jes' one thought I want you to take
away, an' that is, it's sinful to fuss.

This is an atom: 
Ma use' to say livin' was
like quiltin'--you orter keep the peace an' do 'way with the
scraps.

This is an atom: 
Now, what do I want you all to remember?

This is an atom: 
"That's right; now we'll sing 'Pull fer the shore.

This is an atom: 
'"

When the windows had ceased to rattle from the vibrations of the
lusty chorus, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Make 'em
thankful fer whatever they 'are got, even if it ain't but a little.

This is an atom: 
Show us all how to live like you want us to live, an' praise God
from whom all blessin's flow.

This is an atom: 
"

As the last youngster scampered out of the yard, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs turned
to the window where Jim was standing.

This is an atom: 
He had taken no part in the
singing, and was silent and preoccupied.

This is an atom: 
"Jim," said his mother,
trying to look into his face, "you never had on yer overcoat when
you come in.

This is an atom: 
"Mebbe I kin git work
to-morrow, or you'll git a raise, or somethin'; they'll be some
way.

This is an atom: 
"

Little she guessed what the way was to be.

This is an atom: 
They are weary ere they run;

    They have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory
    Which is brighter than the Sun.

This is an atom: 
"

THE cold wave that was ushered in that December morning was the
beginning of a long series of days that vied with each other as to
which could induce the mercury to drop the lowest.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's untiring efforts to find employment had met with no
success, and Jim's exertions were redoubled; day by day his scanty
earnings became less sufficient to meet the demands of the family.

This is an atom: 
On Christmas eve they sat over the stove, after the little ones had
gone to bed, and discussed the situation.

This is an atom: 
The wind hurled itself
against the house in a very frenzy of rage, shaking the icicles from
the window-ledge and hissing through the patched panes.

This is an atom: 
The snow
that sifted in through the loose sash lay unmelted on the sill.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's head was in her hands, and the tears that
trickled through her crooked fingers hissed as they fell on the
stove.

This is an atom: 
It was the first time Jim had ever seen her give up.

This is an atom: 
"Seems like we'll have to ast fer help, Jim," she said.

This is an atom: 
What do you think?

This is an atom: 
I guess--it looks
like mebbe we'll have to apply to the organization.

This is an atom: 
"It 'ud be with
us like it was with the Hornbys; they didn't have nothin' to eat,
and they went to the organization ant the man asted 'em if they had
a bed or a table, an' when they said yes, he said, 'Well, why don't
you sell 'em?

This is an atom: 
As long as we've got coal I'll git the
vittles some way!

This is an atom: 
" He had to pause, for a violent attack of coughing
shook him from head to foot.

This is an atom: 
"I think I can git a night job next
week; one of the market-men comes in from the country ever' night to
git a early start next morning an' he ast me if I'd sleep in his
wagon from three to six an' keep his vegetables from bein' stole.

This is an atom: 
That 'ud gimme time to git home an' git breakfast, an' be down to
the fact'ry by seven.

This is an atom: 
"

"But, Jimmy boy," cried his mother, her voice quivering with
anxiety, "you never could stan' it night an' day too!

This is an atom: 
she hastily dried her
eyes and smoothed her hair.

This is an atom: 
She was tall and slender, but Jim
could only see a pair of sparkling eyes between the brim of the hat
and her high fur collar.

This is an atom: 
It was nice to hear her laugh, though; it
made things seem warmer somehow.

This is an atom: 
"It's from the church," she explained; "a crowd of us are out in
the omnibus distributing baskets.

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, how'd you ever happen to come here?

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, who
had come to the door.

This is an atom: 
"Well, that certainly
is kind an' thoughtful like," she said.

This is an atom: 
"Won't you--" she hesitated;
the room she had just left was not in a condition to receive guests,
but Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Come right in an' git warm," she
said cordially; "the stove's died down some, but you could git
thawed out.

This is an atom: 
thank you, I can't come in," said the young lady, with a side
glance at Jim, who was leaning against the door.

This is an atom: 
The girl was puzzled; she noticed the stamp of poverty on everything
in sight except the bright face of the little woman before her.

This is an atom: 
"Well," she said doubtfully, "if you ever want--to come to see me,
ask for Miss Lucy Olcott at Terrace Park.

This is an atom: 
"

She was gone, and the doorway looked very black and lonesome in
consequence.

This is an atom: 
But there was the big basket to prove she was not
merely an apparition, and it took both Jim and his mother to carry
it in.

This is an atom: 
A big turkey, looking so comical
with his legs stuck in his body that Jim laughed outright.

This is an atom: 
"It's the first turkey that's been in this house fer many a day!

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, delightedly, as she pinched the fat fowl.

This is an atom: 
"I 'spect
Europena'll be skeered of it, it's so big.

This is an atom: 
I'll git Miss Hazy an' Chris to come over
an' spend the day, and I'll carry a plate over to Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Jim was doing a sum on the brown paper that came
over the basket, and presently he looked up and said slowly:

"Ma, I guess we can't have the turkey this year.

This is an atom: 
I kin sell it fer a
dollar seventy-five, and that would buy us hog-meat fer a good
while.

This is an atom: 
She had pictured the joy of a real Christmas dinner, the first the
youngest children had ever known; she had already thought of half a
dozen neighbors to whom she wanted to send "a little snack.

This is an atom: 
We'll sell it in the mornin', an' buy
sausage fer dinner, an' I'll cook some of these here nice
vegetables an' put a orange an' some candy at each plate, an' the
childern'll never know nothin' 'bout it.

This is an atom: 
Besides," she added, "if
you ain't never et turkey meat you don't know how good it is.

This is an atom: 
"

But in spite of her philosophy, after Jim had gone to bed she
slipped over and took one more look at the turkey.

This is an atom: 
"I think I wouldn't 'a' minded so much," she said, wistfully, "ef
they hadn't 'a' sent the cramberries, too!

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's washing supplied the demands of
the family; but by the end of January the clouds had gathered
thicker than before.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's heart was heavy, one night, as she tramped home through
the snow after a hard day's work.

This is an atom: 
The rent was due, the coal was
out, and only a few potatoes were left in the barrel.

This is an atom: 
But these were
mere shadow troubles, compared to Jim's illness; he had been too
sick to go to the factory that morning, and she dared not think what
changes the day may have brought.

This is an atom: 
As she lifted the latch of her
rickety door the sobbing of a child greeted her; it was little
Europena, crying for food.

This is an atom: 
For three days there had been no bread in
the house, and a scanty supply of potatoes and beans had been their
only nourishment.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs hastened to where Jim lay on a cot in the corner; his
cheeks were flushed, and his thin, nervous fingers picked at the old
shawl that covered him.

This is an atom: 
"Jim," she said, kneeling beside him and pressing his hot hand to
her cheek, "Jim, darling lemme go fer the doctor.

This is an atom: 
You're worser
than you was this mornin', an'--an'--I'm so skeered!

This is an atom: 
Jim tried to put his arm around her, but something hurt him in his
chest when he moved, so he patted her hand instead.

This is an atom: 
"Never mind, ma," he said, his breath coming short; "we ain't got no
money to buy the medicine, even if the doctor did come.

This is an atom: 
You go git
some supper, now; an', ma, don't worry; I'm goin' to take keer of
you all!

This is an atom: 
Only--only," he added, wearily, "I guess I can't sleep in
the wagon to-night.

This is an atom: 
"

Slowly the hours passed until midnight.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs had pulled Jim's
cot close to the stove, and applied vigorous measures to relieve
him.

This is an atom: 
Her efforts were unceasing, and one after another the homely
country remedies were faithfully administered.

This is an atom: 
"Seems like I'm hot, then agin I'm cold," he said, speaking with
difficulty.

This is an atom: 
"Could you find a little somethin' more to put over me,
ma?

This is an atom: 
The three little girls
lay huddled under one old quilt, their faces pale and sunken.

This is an atom: 
She
turned away abruptly, and looked toward the corner where Billy slept
on a pallet.

This is an atom: 
The blankets on his bed were insufficient even for him.

This is an atom: 
The hardest grief is often that which leaves no trace.

This is an atom: 
When she
went back to the stove she had a smile ready for the sick boy.

This is an atom: 
"Here's the very thing," she said; "it's my dress skirt.

This is an atom: 
See how nice
it tucks in all 'round!

This is an atom: 
"

For a while he lay silent, then he said: "Ma, are you 'wake?

This is an atom: 
If I ain't better in the morning I
guess--" the words came reluctantly--"I guess you'd better go
see the Christmas lady.

This is an atom: 
'T
won't be fer long, nohow, cause I kin take keer of you all soon--
soon 's I kin git up.

This is an atom: 
"Can't you go to sleep, honey?

This is an atom: 
"No, it's them ole wheels," he said fretfully, "them wheels at the
fact'ry; when I git to sleep they keep on wakin' me up.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's hands were rough and knotted, but love taught them to
be gentle as she smoothed his hot head.

This is an atom: 
Since he was a little boy he had loved to hear of their old home in
the valley.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, ma; mebbe it will make me fergit the wheels," he said.

This is an atom: 
"Well," she began, putting her head beside his on the pillow, so he
could not watch her face, "it was all jes' like a big front yard
without no fences, an' the flowers didn't belong to folks like they
do over on the avenue, where you dassent pick a one; but they was
God's, an' you was welcome to all you could pull.

This is an atom: 
An' there was
trees, Jim, where you could climb up an' git big red apples, an'
when the frost 'ud come they'd be persimmons that 'ud jes' melt in
yer mouth.

This is an atom: 
An' you could look 'way off 'crost the meaders, an' see
the trees a-wavin' in the sunshine, an' up over yer head the birds
'ud be singin' like they was never goin' to stop.

This is an atom: 
I kin remember jes' how you looked, Jim--a fat little
boy, with red cheeks a-laughin' all the time.

This is an atom: 
Jim scarcely knew when she stopped; his eyes were half
closed, and a sweet drowsiness was upon him.

This is an atom: 
"It's nice an' warm in the sunshine," he murmured; "the meaders an'
trees--laughin' all the time!

This is an atom: 
"

Then Jim began to sing too, softly and monotonously, and the sorrow
that had not come with years left his tired face, and he fearlessly
drifted away into the Shadowy Valley where his lost childhood lay.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER III

THE "CHRISTMAS LADY"

    "The rosy glow of summer
    Is on thy dimpled cheek,
    While in thy heart the winter
    Is lying cold and bleak.

This is an atom: 
"But this shall change hereafter,
    When years have done their part,
    And on thy cheek the wintered
    And summer in thy heart.

This is an atom: 
The lamps had not been lighted, but the blaze from
the back-log threw a cozy glow of comfort over the crimson curtains
and on the mass of bright-hued pillows in the window-seat.

This is an atom: 
Robert Redding, standing with his hat in his hand, would have been
gone long ago if the "Christmas Lady" had not worn her violet gown.

This is an atom: 
He said it always took him half an hour to say good-by when she wore
a rose in her hair, and a full hour when she had on the violet
dress.

This is an atom: 
"By Jove, stand there a minute just as you are!

This is an atom: 
" he said teasingly, as he tried to catch her hand.

This is an atom: 
"

Lucy Olcott looked up at him for a moment in silence; he was very
tall and straight, and his face retained much of its boyishness, in
spite of the firm, square jaw.

This is an atom: 
"Robert," she said, suddenly grown serious, "I wish you would do
something for me.

This is an atom: 
"

"All right; what is it?

This is an atom: 
"Oh, no; it isn't that," she said hurriedly; "but, Robert, it makes
people think such wrong things about you; I can't bear to have you
misjudged.

This is an atom: 
"

Redding put his arm around her, and together they stood looking down
into the glowing embers.

This is an atom: 
"Tell me about it, little girl; what have you heard?

This is an atom: 
"It wasn't true what they said.

This is an atom: 
I knew it wasn't
true, but they had no right to say it.

This is an atom: 
What was it?

This is an atom: 
"

"Some people were here last night from New Orleans; they asked if I
knew you--said they knew you and Dick the year you spent there.

This is an atom: 
"They said some
horrid things then, just because you were Dick's friend.

This is an atom: 
"

"What were they, Lucy?

This is an atom: 
"

"They told me that you were both as wild as could be; that your
reputation was no better than his; that--forgive me, Robert, for
even repeating it.

This is an atom: 
It made me very angry, and I told them it was not
true--not a word of it; that it was all Dick's fault; that he--"

"Lucy," interrupted Redding, peremptorily, "wait until you hear me!

This is an atom: 
I have never lied to you about anything, and I will not stoop to it
now.

This is an atom: 
Four years ago, when those people knew me, I was just what they
said.

This is an atom: 
Neither of us had a home or people to care about us, so we went in
for a good time.

This is an atom: 
At the end of the year I was sick of it all, braced
up, and came here.

This is an atom: 
"

At his first words the color had left Lucy's face, and she had
slipped to the opposite side of the fire, and stood watching him
with horrified eyes.

This is an atom: 
It was an awful pull, and Heaven only knows how I
struggled.

This is an atom: 
I never quite saw the use of it all, until I met you six
months ago; then I realized that the past four years had been given
me in which to make a man of myself.

This is an atom: 
"

As he finished speaking he saw, for the first time, that Lucy was
crying.

This is an atom: 
I'm so terribly disappointed, and hurt, and--stunned.

This is an atom: 
"

"But you surely don't love me the less for having conquered these
things in the past?

This is an atom: 
"

"I don't know, I don't know," she said, with a sob.

This is an atom: 
"I honored and
idealized you, Robert I can never think of you as being other than
you are now.

This is an atom: 
"It was only one year out of my
life; too much, it's true, but I have atoned for it with all my
might.

This is an atom: 
She was very young, with the stern, uncompromising
standards of girlhood; life was black or white to her, and time had
not yet filled in the canvas with the myriad grays that blend into
one another until all lines are effaced, and only the Master Artist
knows the boundaries.

This is an atom: 
"I'll try to forgive you," she
said, tremulously; "but you must promise to give up your friendship
for Dick Harris.

This is an atom: 
"That's not fair!

This is an atom: 
"You
know Dick's my chum; that he hasn't the least influence over me;
that I am about the only one to stand by him.

This is an atom: 
"

"I am not afraid of his influence, but I don't want people to see
you together; it makes them say things.

This is an atom: 
"

"But, Lucy, you wouldn't have me go back on him?

This is an atom: 
Dick has a big
heart; he's trying to brace up--"

"Oh, nonsense!

This is an atom: 
He likes
to drink and gamble, so he does it, and you keep him in countenance
by your friendship.

This is an atom: 
Redding's face was clouded, and he spoke slowly: "You wouldn't ask
this of me, Lucy, if you understood.

This is an atom: 
Dick and I have been chums
since we were boys.

This is an atom: 
One day he came into the office and said, 'Bob, you 've
pulled through all right; do you think it's too late for me to
try?

This is an atom: 
' What would you have said?

This is an atom: 
"

"What you did, probably," answered Lucy; "but I would have profited
by the one experience, for he has hardly drawn a sober breath
since.

This is an atom: 
" She looked out of the window across the snowy landscape, and
in her face was something of the passionless purity of the scene
upon which her eyes rested.

This is an atom: 
"You are mistaken," he cried fiercely.

This is an atom: 
"Because you have seen him
several times in that condition, you have no right to draw such a
conclusion.

This is an atom: 
He is weak, nobody denies it; but what can you know of
the struggle he makes, of his eagerness to do better, of the fight
that he is constantly making with himself?

This is an atom: 
"It is bad enough," she
said, "to know that my defense of you last night was worse than
useless, but to have you persist in a friendship with a man who is
beneath you in every way is more than I can stand.

This is an atom: 
"I could never marry a
man of whom I was ashamed.

This is an atom: 
"

The shot went home; there was a white line about Redding's mouth as
he turned away.

This is an atom: 
"I would not ask you to," he said, with simple dignity, as he opened
the door.

This is an atom: 
A shabby woman stood looking at them with wild eyes; her
gray hair had escaped from the torn shawl that was pinned over her
head, and stray locks blew across her face.

This is an atom: 
"I will come when you send for me," said Redding, without looking at
her, and, turning abruptly, he strode down the steps and out into
the dusk.

This is an atom: 
Lucy caught her breath and started forward, then she remembered the
woman.

This is an atom: 
"What is it?

This is an atom: 
The woman stepped forward, and put out a hand to steady herself
against the door; her face was distorted, and her voice came in
gasps.

This is an atom: 
"You said I was to come if I needed you.

This is an atom: 
"

IT may be experience of suffering makes one especially tender to the
heart-aches of others; at any rate, the article that Lucy Olcott
wrote for the paper that night held the one touch of nature that
makes the whole world kin.

This is an atom: 
She had taken Aunt Chloe, the old colored
servant, and gone home with Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, relieving as far as possible
the immediate need of the family.

This is an atom: 
Then she had come home and written
their story, telling it simply, but with the passionate earnestness
of one who, for the first time, has come into contact with poverty
and starvation.

This is an atom: 
She told of the plucky struggle made by the boy, of
his indomitable courage, of his final defeat, and she ended by
asking help of any kind for the destitute family.

This is an atom: 
Her article, written on
the impulse of the moment, with the one thought of making people
understand, had fulfilled its mission.

This is an atom: 
sent fifty dollars,
and six ragged newsboys came to present thirty cents.

This is an atom: 
A lavender
note, with huge monogram and written in white ink, stated that some
of the girls of the "Gay Burlesque Troupe" sent a few dimes to the
"kid's" mother.

This is an atom: 
Van
Larkin's coachman had to wait with her note while Lucy answered the
questions of a lame old negro who had brought a quarter.

This is an atom: 
"Maria done tole me what was writ in de papah 'bout dat pore Chile,"
he was saying.

This is an atom: 
I ain't got
much, but I tole Maria I guess we could do without somethin' to gib
a quahter.

This is an atom: 
"

It was like a direct answer to her prayer, and yet this poor little
suppliant, instead of being duly exalted, put her head on the desk
and wept bitterly.

This is an atom: 
Now that the need of the Wiggs family had been
met, another appeal, silent and potent, was troubling her heart.

This is an atom: 
Redding had neither come nor written, and she was beginning to
realize the seriousness of their misunderstanding.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER IV

THE ANNEXATION OF CUBY

    "They well deserve to have,
    That know the strongest and surest way to get.

This is an atom: 
"

ALMOST a year rolled over the Cabbage Patch, and it was nearing
Christmas again.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's heart by Jim's death
could never be filled, but time was beginning to soften her grief,
and the necessity for steady employment kept her from brooding over
her trouble.

This is an atom: 
It was still needful to maintain the strictest economy, for half the
money which had been given them was in Miss Olcott's keeping as a
safeguard against another rainy day.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs had got as much
washing as she could do; Asia helped about the house, and Billy did
odd jobs wherever he could find them.

This is an atom: 
The direct road to fortune, however, according to Billy's ideas,
could best be traveled in a kindling-wagon, and, while he was the
proud possessor of a dilapidated wagon, sole relic of the late Mr.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, he had nothing to hitch to it.

This is an atom: 
Scarcely a week passed that he
did not agitate the question, and, as Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs often said, "When
Billy Wiggs done set his head to a thing, he's as good as got it!

This is an atom: 
"

So she was not surprised when he rushed breathlessly into the
kitchen one evening, about supper-time, and exclaimed in excited
tones: "Ma, I 've got a horse!

This is an atom: 
He was havin' a fit on the commons
an' they was goin' to shoot him, an' I ast the man to give him to
me!

This is an atom: 
What do you want with a fit-horse?

This is an atom: 
The man said if I took him I'd
have to pay fer cartin' away his carcass, but I said, 'All right, I
'll take him, anyway.

This is an atom: 
"He's 'most gone," said one of the men, as she came up.

This is an atom: 
"I tole
Billy you'd beat him fer takin' that ole nag offen the man's
han's.

This is an atom: 
That hoss's carcass is worth something I
'spect he'd bring 'bout two dollars dead, an' mebbe more living.

This is an atom: 
Anyway, I'm goin' to save him if there's any save to him!

This is an atom: 
"I'll tell you what's the matter with him," was her final
diagnosis; "his lights is riz.

This is an atom: 
Billy, I'm goin' home fer some
medicine; you set on his head so's he can't git up, an' ma'll be
right back in a minute.

This is an atom: 
"

The crowd which had collected to see the horse shot began to
disperse, for it was supper-time, and there was nothing to see now
but the poor suffering animal, with Billy Wiggs patiently sitting on
its head.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs returned she carried a bottle, and what appeared to
be a large marble.

This is an atom: 
Now, you
prop his jaw open with a little stick, an' I'll shove it in, an'
then hole his head back, while I pour down some water an' turkentine
outen this bottle.

This is an atom: 
"

It was with great difficulty that this was accomplished, for the old
horse had evidently seen a vision of the happy hunting-ground, and
was loath to return to the sordid earth.

This is an atom: 
His limbs were already
stiffening in death, and the whites of his eyes only were visible.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs noted these discouraging symptoms, and saw that violent
measures were necessary.

This is an atom: 
I 've got to
run over home.

This is an atom: 
Build it right up clost to him, Billy; we 've got to
git him het up.

This is an atom: 
"

She rushed into the kitchen, and, taking several cakes of tallow
from the shelf, threw them into a tin bucket.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs did not believe in sacrificing the present
need to the future comfort.

This is an atom: 
She threw in a liberal portion of
pepper, and, seizing the kettle in one hand and the bucket of tallow
in the other, staggered back to the bonfire.

This is an atom: 
I'm
goin' to git that ole hoss so het up he'll think he's havin' a
sunstroke!

This is an atom: 
Seems sorter bad to keep on pestering him when he's so
near gone, but this here soup'll feel good when it once gits inside
him.

This is an atom: 
"

When the kettle was empty, the soup was impartially distributed over
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs and the patient, but a goodly amount had "got inside,"
and already the horse was losing his rigidity.

This is an atom: 
Only once did Billy pause in his work, and that was to ask:

"Ma, what do you think I'd better name him?

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's chief accomplishments, and
usually required much thoughtful consideration; but in this case if
there was to be a christening it must be at once.

This is an atom: 
"I'd like a jography name," suggested Billy, feeling that nothing
was too good to bestow upon his treasure.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs stood with the soup dripping from her hands, and
earnestly contemplated the horse.

This is an atom: 
Babies, pigs, goats, and puppies
had drawn largely on her supply of late, and geography names
especially were scarce.

This is an atom: 
"I'll tell you what, Billy!

This is an atom: 
Wiggs carried it over
by the horse, and put each of his hoofs into the hot liquid, while
Billy rubbed the legs with all the strength of his young arms.

This is an atom: 
"That's right," she said; "now you run home an' git that piece of
carpet by my bed, an' we'll kiver him up.

This is an atom: 
I am goin' to git them
fence rails over yonder to keep the fire goin'.

This is an atom: 
"

Through the long night they worked with their patient, and when the
first glow of morning appeared in the east, a triumphant procession
wended its way across the Cabbage Patch.

This is an atom: 
First came an old woman,
bearing sundry pails, kettles, and bottles; next came a very sleepy
little boy, leading a trembling old horse, with soup all over its
head, tallow on its feet, and a strip of rag-carpet tied about its
middle.

This is an atom: 
And thus Cuba, like his geographical namesake, emerged from the
violent ordeal of reconstruction with a mangled constitution,
internal dissension, a decided preponderance of foreign element, but
a firm and abiding trust in the new power with which his fortunes
had been irrevocably cast.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER V

A REMINISCENCE

    "It is easy enough to be pleasant
    When life flows along like a song,
    But the man worth while is the one who will smile
    When everything goes dead wrong.

This is an atom: 
"

WHEN Miss Hazy was awakened early that morning by a resonant neigh
at the head of her bed, she mistook it for the trump of doom.

This is an atom: 
Miss
Hazy's cottage, as has been said, was built on the bias in the
Wiggses' side yard, and the little lean-to, immediately behind Miss
Hazy's bedroom, had been pressed into service as Cuba's temporary
abiding-place.

This is an atom: 
After her first agonized fright, the old woman ventured to push the
door open a crack and peep out.

This is an atom: 
"Chris," she said, in a tense whisper, to her sleeping nephew--
"Chris, what on airth is this here hitched to our shutter?

This is an atom: 
"

Chris, usually deaf to all calls less emphatic than cold water and a
broomstick, raised a rumpled head from the bed-clothes.

This is an atom: 
" said Miss Hazy, still in a terrified whisper, and
holding fast the door, as if the specter might attempt an entrance.

This is an atom: 
Chris did not stop to adjust his wooden leg, but hopped over to the
door, and cautiously put an eye to the opening.

This is an atom: 
" he said, in disgust,
having nerved himself for nothing less than a rhinoceros, such as he
had seen in the circus.

This is an atom: 
"How'd he git there?

This is an atom: 
She
had once heard of a baby being left on a doorstep, but never a
horse.

This is an atom: 
When the limit of her curiosity was about reached, she saw
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"

Miss Hazy put the ash-barrel between herself and the animal, and
hazarded a timid inspection, while Mrs.

This is an atom: 
" asked Miss Hazy, as she
concluded.

This is an atom: 
"Well, I b'lieve I will," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs chose the chair which had the least on it, and leaned
back, smiling affably as she remarked: "We 're used to hosses; this
here's the second one we 've had.

This is an atom: 
" said Miss Hazy, "you muster been well to do!

This is an atom: 
Did I ever tell you 'bout how Jim brought our other hoss to town?

This is an atom: 
"

Miss Hazy had heard the story a number of times, but she knew the
duties of a hostess.

This is an atom: 
"You see, me an' the
childern was comin' on the steam-car train, but ther' wasn't no way
to git the hoss here, 'ceptin' fer somebody to ride him.

This is an atom: 
" She
paused to wipe her eyes on her apron, and Miss Hazy wept in
sympathy.

This is an atom: 
Go on an' tell me what you done
next.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, swallowing the lump in her throat, "Jim
said he'd go.

This is an atom: 
He never had been to the city, an' he was jes' a
little shaver, but I knowed I could trust him.

This is an atom: 
"

"I don't see how you could stand to risk it!

This is an atom: 
"Oh, I reckon whatever you got to do, you kin do.

This is an atom: 
I didn't see no
other way; so one mornin' I put a old fo-patch quilt over the hoss,
tied a bucket of oats on behin' it an' fixed some vittles fer Jim,
an' started 'em off.

This is an atom: 
It was a forty-mile ride to the city, so I
calkerlated to start Jim so's he'd git to Dr.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs was a widow man when I married him.

This is an atom: 
Looked like all his inflictions gethered together
in that head of hisn.

This is an atom: 
"I guess you knew I killed him," continued Mrs.

This is an atom: 
He was jes' gitten over typhoid, an' I
give him pork an' beans.

This is an atom: 
I was settin' by
him, waitin' fer the doctor to git there, an' I kep' saying 'Oh, Mr.

This is an atom: 
You don't think you are dying do you?

This is an atom: 
' an' he answered up
jes' as natural an' fretful-like, 'Good lan', Nancy!

This is an atom: 
How do I know?

This is an atom: 
"But he
was what you might say a well-wisher.

This is an atom: 
But, as I was tellin' you, Dr.

This is an atom: 
White was a old friend, an' I pinned a note on Jim's coat tellin'
who he was an' where he was going an' knowed the doctor would have a
eye on him when he got as fur as Smithville.

This is an atom: 
As fer the rest of the
trip, I wasn't so certain.

This is an atom: 
The only person I knowed in the city was
Pete Jenkins, an' if there was one man in the world I didn't have
no use fer, it was Pete.

This is an atom: 
But when I don't like folks I try to do
somethin' nice fer 'em.

This is an atom: 
Seems like that's the only way I kin weed
out my meanness.

This is an atom: 
So I jes' sez to Jim, 'You keep on astin' till you
git to No.

This is an atom: 
You
tell him,' sez I, 'you are Hiram Wiggs's boy, an' as long as he done
so much harm to yer pa, mebbe he'd be glad to do a good turn by
you, an' keep you an' the hoss fer the night, till yer ma comes fer
you.

This is an atom: 
' Well, Jim started off, lookin' mighty little settin' up on
that big hoss, an' I waved my apron long as I could; then I hid
behin' a tree to keep him from seein' me cry.

This is an atom: 
He rode all that day,
an' 'bout sundown he come to Dr.

This is an atom: 
Pore little feller, he was
so tired an' stiff he couldn't hardly walk, but he tied the hoss to
the post an' went 'round to the back door an' knocked real easy.

This is an atom: 
White come to the door an' sez, real cross, 'No, doctor ain't
here,' an' slammed it shut agin.

This is an atom: 
I ain't meanin' to blame her; mebbe
her bread was in the oven, or her baby crying or somethin', but
seems to me I couldn't have treated a dog that a-way!

This is an atom: 
"Pore Jim, he dragged out to the road agin, an' set there beside the
hoss, not knowin' what to do nex'.

This is an atom: 
Night was a-comin' on, he hadn't
had no supper, an' he was dead beat.

This is an atom: 
By an' by he went to sleep, an'
didn't know nothin' till somebody shuck his shoulder an' sez, 'Git
up from here!

This is an atom: 
What you doin' sleepin' here in the road?

This is an atom: 
' Then he
went stumblin' 'long, with somebody holdin' his arm, an' he was took
into a big, bright room, an' the doctor was lookin' at him an'
astin' him questions.

This is an atom: 
An' Jim said he never did know what he
answered, but it must 'a' been right, fer the doctor grabbed holt of
his hand, an' sez: 'Bless my soul!

This is an atom: 
Why, he'll sleep in the
bed with my boys, an' they orter be proud to have sech a plucky
bedfeller!

This is an atom: 
'

"Jim never did fergit them words; they meant a good deal more to him
than his supper.

This is an atom: 
He didn't git into the city till 'long 'bout four
o'clock, an' he sez he never was so mixed in all his life.

This is an atom: 
All my
childern was green about town; it made ever' one of 'em sick when
they first rode on the street-cars, an' Europena was skeered to
death of the newsboys, 'cause she thought they called 'Babies,'
'stid of 'Papers.

This is an atom: 
' Jim kep' right on the main road, like he was tole
to, but things kep' a-happenin' 'round him so fast, he said he 
couldn't do no more 'n jes' keep out the way.

This is an atom: 
It was runnin' off, an' 'fore
he knowed it a man hit it in the head an' veered it 'round towards
him; Jim said his hoss turned a clean somerset, an' he was th'owed
up in the air, an'--"

"Ma!

This is an atom: 
"I never was havin' a good time in my
life that one of my childern didn't git in that rain-barrel!

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, go on an' finish," said Miss Hazy, to whom the story had lost
nothing by repetition.

This is an atom: 
6 Injun House, an' Pete Jenkins
jes' treated him like he'd been his own son.

This is an atom: 
I was done cured then
an' there fer my feelin' aginst Pete.

This is an atom: 
He ain't as sperited as he looks.

This is an atom:

BILLY'S foreign policy proved most satisfactory, and after the
annexation of Cuba many additional dimes found their way into the
tin box on top of the wardrobe.

This is an atom: 
"

One cold December day Billy came in and found his mother leaning
wearily on the table.

This is an atom: 
Her face brightened as he entered, but he
caught the tired look in her eyes.

This is an atom: 
"What's the matter?

This is an atom: 
"Ain't nothin' the matter, Billy," she said, trying to speak
cheerfully; "I'm jes' wore out, that's all.

This is an atom: 
It'll be with me like
it was with Uncle Ned's ole ox, I reckon; he kep' a-goin' an'
a-goin' till he died a-standin' up, an' even then they had to push
him over.

This is an atom: 
"

She walked to the window, and stood gazing absently across the
commons.

This is an atom: 
"Do you know, Billy," she said suddenly, "I 've got the
craziest notion in my head.

This is an atom: 
"

If she had expressed a wish for a diamond necklace, Billy could not
have been more amazed, and his countenance expressed his state of
mind.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs hastened to explain:

"Course, I ain't really thinkin' 'bout goin', but them show-bills
started me to studyin' about it, an' I got to wishin' me an' you
could go.

This is an atom: 
"

"I don't 'spect it's much when you git inside," said Billy, trying
the effects of negative consolation.

This is an atom: 
"

"What's skin-tights?

This is an atom: 
You see, the man couldn't wear many clothes, 'cause it would make
him too heavy to stay up there in the air.

This is an atom: 
The band plays all the
time, an' folks sing an' speechify, an' ever'body laughs an' has a
good time.

This is an atom: 
"

Billy's brows were puckered, and he sat unusually quiet for a while,
looking at his mother.

This is an atom: 
" she exclaimed, "do you
think I'd take an' go to a show, when Asia an' Australia ain't got
a good shoe to their backs?

This is an atom: 
"

Billy said no more about the theater, but that afternoon, when he
was out with the kindling, he pondered the matter deeply.

This is an atom: 
It was
quite cold, and sometimes he had to put the reins between his knees
and shove his hands deep into his pockets to get the stiffness out
of them.

This is an atom: 
It really seemed as if everybody had just laid in a supply
of kindling, and the shadowy little plan he had been forming was
growing more shadowy all the time.

This is an atom: 
"I 'spect the tickets cost a heap," he thought ruefully, as he drew
himself up into a regular pretzel of a boy; "but, then, she never
does have no fun, an' never gits a thing fer herself.

This is an atom: 
" And because
Billy knew of his mother's many sacrifices, and because he found it
very hard to take Jim's place, a lump lodged in his throat, and gave
him so much trouble that he forgot for a while how cold he was.

This is an atom: 
About this time he came within sight of the Opera House, and
tantalizing posters appeared of the "Greatest Extravaganza of the
Century.

This is an atom: 
" He pulled Cuba into a walk, and sat there absorbing the
wonders depicted; among the marvels were crowds of children dressed
as butterflies, beautiful ladies marching in line, a man balancing a
barrel on his feet, and--yes, there was the man in "skin-tights"
walking on the rope!

This is an atom: 
A keen puff of wind brought Billy back to his senses, and as his
longing eyes turned from the gorgeous show-bills they encountered
the amused look of a gentleman who had just come out from the Opera
House.

This is an atom: 
He was so tall and fine-looking that Billy thought he must
own the show.

This is an atom: 
"Couldn't you use a whole load, if I was to take it out in
tickets?

This is an atom: 
"What do you want
with more than one ticket?

This is an atom: 
"

There was a certain sympathy in his voice, in spite of the fact that
he was still laughing, and before Billy knew it he had told him all
about it.

This is an atom: 
"How many tickets could yer gimme fer the load?

This is an atom: 
"Well, I should say that load was worth about five tickets.

This is an atom: 
" cried the boy; "that 'ud take us all!

This is an atom: 
"

He followed the gentleman back to the ticket-office, and eagerly
watched the man behind the little window count out five tickets and
put them in a pink envelope.

This is an atom: 
"One for you, one for your mother, and three for the kids," said his
friend, as Billy buttoned the treasure in the inside pocket of his
ragged coat.

This is an atom: 
He was so excited that he almost forgot his part of the bargain, but
as the gentleman was turning away he remembered.

This is an atom: 
"Say, mister, where must I take the kindlin' to?

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh, that's all right; you can sell it to-morrow," answered the
other.

This is an atom: 
"If you don't take the kindlin', I'll
have to give you back the tickets.

This is an atom: 
Ma don't 'low us to take nothin'
that way.

This is an atom: 
But he had no time to dwell on it,
for this new complication demanded all his attention.

This is an atom: 
"No, no; go along; that's all
right.

This is an atom: 
"

But Billy knew it would not be all right when he got home, so he
made one more effort.

This is an atom: 
"How'd you like to send it out to Miss Hazy?

This is an atom: 
Who is she?

This is an atom: 
Bob, who is worse off than she is, for he
hasn't even a home.

This is an atom: 
Such scrubbing and brushing as was taking place!

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, as she
pressed out Asia's best dress; "here I been thinkin' 'bout it, an'
wantin' to go, an' here I am actually gittin' ready to go!

This is an atom: 
Come
here, child, and let me iron out yer plaits while the iron's good
an' hot.

This is an atom: 
"

This painful operation was performed only on state occasions; each
little Wiggs laid her head on the ironing-board, a willing sacrifice
on the altar of vanity, while Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Europena was the only one who objected to being
a burnt-offering, but when she saw the frizzled locks of the others,
her pride conquered her fear, and, holding tight to Billy's hand,
she bent her chubby head to the trying ordeal.

This is an atom: 
Krasmier borrowed it yesterday to wear to
her pa's funeral, but I guess she's sent it back by this time.

This is an atom: 
An',
Billy--Billy, wait a minute; you be sure to tell 'em we are goin'
to the show.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs vigorously brushed her hair with the
clothes-brush as she spoke.

This is an atom: 
"

"Who's goin' to wear it, ma?

This is an atom: 
" The question came in anxious tones,
for the blue alpaca had been sent them in a bundle of old clothes,
and though it failed to fit either of the girls, the wearing of it
was a much coveted privilege.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs had seen trouble before over the blue alpaca; she knew
what anguish her decision must bring to one or the other.

This is an atom: 
"It really looks best on Asia," she thought; "but if I let her wear
it Austry'll have a cryin' spell an' git to holdin' her breath, an'
that'll take up so much time.

This is an atom: 
" So she added aloud: "I'll tell you
what we'll do.

This is an atom: 
"

But when she had pinned the skirt over one little girl's red calico
dress, and buttoned the blue waist over the clean apron of the
other, she looked at them dubiously.

This is an atom: 
"They do look kinder mixed,"
she admitted to herself, "but I reckon it don't matter, so long as
they 're both happy.

This is an atom: 
" he exclaimed, holding up his trophy, "I swapped 'em with
Pete fer a top an' a agate.

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, now, ain't that nice?

This is an atom: 
I wisht you had something to fix up in,
Billy," she added; "you look as seedy as a raspberry.

This is an atom: 
"

Billy did look rather shabby; his elbows were out, and two of the
holes in his pants were patched and two were not.

This is an atom: 
"I wisht I could find somethin' of yer pa's that would do.

This is an atom: 
Here's
his white gloves he wore that time he was pallbearer to ole Mr.

This is an atom: 
I ain't a-goin' to wear no gloves," said Billy, firmly.

This is an atom: 
"Here's yer grandpa's watch-fob,
but I'm skeered fer you to wear it, you might lose it.

This is an atom: 
It's a
family remnant--been handed down two generations.

This is an atom: 
What about this
here red comforter?

This is an atom: 
It would sorter spruce you up, an' keep you
warm, besides; you know you 've had a cold fer a week, an' yer pipes
is all stopped up.

This is an atom: 
At seven o 'clock they were ready, and, the news having spread
abroad that the Wiggses were going to a show, many of the neighbors
came in to see how they looked and to hear how it happened.

This is an atom: 
I
am jes' that skeered of hurtin' Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs said nervously, as she stepped off the
porch.

This is an atom: 
The little procession had left the railroad tracks far behind, when
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Do you know what we 've gone an' done?

This is an atom: 
We have left the theayter tickets to home!

This is an atom: 
"Billy, you run back, fast as yer legs kin carry you, an' look in
that tin can behind the clock, an' we'll wait right here fer you.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs wrapped Europena in her shawl, and tried to keep up the
spirits of the party as they huddled on the curbing to await Billy's
return.

This is an atom: 
"Look how pretty it looks, all the lights a-streamin' out the
winders on the snow.

This is an atom: 
It was very cold, and even the prospect of the show was dimmed by
the present discomfort.

This is an atom: 
"What's the matter, honey?

This is an atom: 
Don't cry; Billy'll be back in a little
while, an' then we'll git in where it's good an' warm.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs for the first time that, in the
excitement of preparation, supper had been entirely overlooked.

This is an atom: 
"I had jes' 'bout as much
idea of supper as a goat has of kid gloves!

This is an atom: 
"

But when Billy came flying back with the tickets, and the party had
started once more on the long walk to the Opera House, the enticing
posters began to appear, and supper and the cold were forgotten.

This is an atom: 
BOB"

    "If his heart at high floods
    Swamped his brain now and then,
    'T was but richer for that
    When the tide ebbed again.

This is an atom: 
"

A LARGE audience assembled that night to witness "The Greatest
Extravaganza of the Century.

This is an atom: 
Tonight he evidently
failed to find what he sought, and was turning listlessly away when
he stopped suddenly, bent forward, then smiled broadly.

This is an atom: 
He had
caught sight of Billy's red comforter.

This is an atom: 
The boy's hair was plastered close to his head, and his face was
transformed by soap and happiness.

This is an atom: 
Redding glanced quizzically at
the rest of the party--at the mother's radiant countenance beaming
from the dusk of her crepe veil, at the three little girls in their
composite costumes, at the carnations pinned on each bosom.

This is an atom: 
Their
enjoyment was so evident that Redding was surprised, at the close of
the first act, to see them put on their wraps and march solemnly out
of the theater.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs was hopelessly entangled in the crepe veil, but her ideas
of etiquette were rigid.

This is an atom: 
She disengaged one hand and said, with
dignity: "I 'low this is Mr.

This is an atom: 
"But why are you going home?

This is an atom: 
"Where else would we go to?

This is an atom: 
"Why not stay and see the play out?

This is an atom: 
That was only the first act.

This is an atom: 
"Why, of course," explained Redding, "lots more.

This is an atom: 
Now, go back, and
stay until everybody has left the theater, and then you will be
certain it's over.

This is an atom: 
After the curtain descended on the final tableau, Redding waited in
the lobby while the stream of people passed.

This is an atom: 
The Wiggses had obeyed
instructions, and were the very last to come out.

This is an atom: 
"

Billy and his mother exchanged doubtful glances; for the past three
hours everything had been so strange and unusual that they were
bewildered.

This is an atom: 
"You see, we will go right over to Bond's and have something to eat
before you go home," urged Redding.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs was in great doubt, but one of the little girls pulled
her skirt and said, in pleading tones: "Ma, let's do!

This is an atom: 
As they were crossing the
street, Asia stopped suddenly and cried:

"Ma, there's the 'Christmas Lady' gittin' in that hack!

This is an atom: 
Redding took them into a small apartment, curtained off from the
rest of the cafe, so that only the waiters commented on the strange
party.

This is an atom: 
At first there was oppressive silence; then the host turned
to Europena and asked her what she liked best to eat.

This is an atom: 
A moment of
torture ensued for the small lady, during which she nearly twisted
her thumb from its socket, then she managed to gasp:

"Green pups!

This is an atom: 
"What on earth
does she mean?

This is an atom: 
"

After this the ice, while not broken, at least had a crack in it,
and by the time the first course was served Redding was telling them
a funny story, and three of the audience were able to smile.

This is an atom: 
It had
pleased him to order an elaborate supper, and he experienced the
keenest enjoyment over the novelty of the situation.

This is an atom: 
The Wiggses ate
as he had never seen people eat before.

This is an atom: 
He sat by and, with
consummate tact, made them forget everything but the good time they
were having.

This is an atom: 
As the supper progressed, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
She still
wore her black cotton gloves, and gesticulated with a chicken
croquette as she talked.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," she was saying, "Jim was one of these handy childern; when he
was eight years old he could peddle as good as you could!

This is an atom: 
I guess
you heard 'bout our roof; ever'body was talkin' 'bout it.

This is an atom: 
Billy is
takin' right after him; do you know what that boy has gone an' done?

This is an atom: 
I was allers a-wishin' that Mr.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs could have a monumint, and Billy never said a word, but he set
his head to it.

This is an atom: 
One day he come home with a lot of these here tiles
what they had throwed out from the tile fact'ry; some of 'em was
jes' a little nicked, an' the others was jes' as good as new.

This is an atom: 
Ever' night he used to set on the floor an' fool with them
things, a-fittin' 'em here an' crackin' 'em off there, but I never
paid no 'tention to him.

This is an atom: 
One night, when I come in from Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Eichorn's, what did I see on the floor but a sure-'nough
tombstun-slab, an' spelt out in little blue tiles down the middle
was:

"'Pa.

This is an atom: 
'

"I was jes' that pleased I set down an' bust out cryin'.

This is an atom: 
We made a
sorter box to hold it, an' chinked it up with cement, an' las'
Sunday me an' the childern took it out an' fixed it up on Mr.

This is an atom: 
Some day we are going to make Jimmy one; you know
Jimmy's my boy that's dead.

This is an atom: 
" Her eyes filled and her lips
trembled; even the sunshine of her buoyant nature could not dispel
one shadow that always lay across her heart.

This is an atom: 
At this moment Billy, doubtless thrilled at being the topic of
conversation, upset his glass of water, and the deluge descended
full upon Australia, drenching the waist of the blue alpaca.

This is an atom: 
Threats and persuasion were alike unavailing; she
even refused to be mopped off, but slid in a disconsolate heap under
the table.

This is an atom: 
Redding attempted to invade the citadel with an orange as
a flag of truce, but his overtures were ineffectual, and he was
compelled to retreat under fire.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, placidly, as she
spread her salad on a piece of bread.

This is an atom: 
"She'll git to holdin' her
breath if you notice her.

This is an atom: 
"

The shrieks gradually diminished to spasmodic sobs, which in turn
gave place to ominous silence.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's advice and ignoring the
flood sufferer, "how would you like to be my office-boy?

This is an atom: 
"You see, it's a newspaper office,
and while the pay isn't much at first, still it's better than
peddling kindling, and there would be a chance for promotion as he
got older.

This is an atom: 
I 'spect he could take to writin'
newspapers right away, if you could hold him down to it.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs was so
educated--the most fluent man in jography I ever seen!

This is an atom: 
Bob when I grow up," said Billy, stoutly.

This is an atom: 
His recollection of his paternal parent was not the sort ideals are
made of.

This is an atom: 
Just here the waiter appeared with the final course, and Asia lifted
the tablecloth and whispered, "Say, 'Straly, we 've got ice-cream.

This is an atom: 
Then little Europena, with baby wisdom, put her tow head
under the cloth, and said, "'Traly, it's pink!

This is an atom: 
" and Australia
emerged, tear-stained but smiling, and finished her supper on Mr.

This is an atom: 
When the limit of capacity had been tested to the fullest, and Billy
had declared that "he couldn't swaller no more, he was jes'
chawin'," Redding filled their pockets with candy and, when Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs was not looking, put a quarter in each hand.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs's protestations, he put them
in, and repeated Billy's directions as to the exact location of the
Cabbage Patch.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, leaning back against
carriage cushions for the first time in her life, while Redding
lifted Europena in beside her.

This is an atom: 
"We 've seed a good time fer onct in our lives," said Asia.

This is an atom: 
It was
the first time she had spoken since they left the theater.

This is an atom: 
" came from the sleepy Australia, who did not
know what new attraction was being offered, but was resolved not to
miss anything.

This is an atom: 
"

Redding stood on the corner where they had left him, and the smile
died out of his face.

This is an atom: 
Within a block was a jolly crowd and a hearty
welcome; across the street was the big apartment house where his
dark and cheerless window promised him nothing.

This is an atom: 
"There is certainly nobody to care where I go," he
thought gloomily; then suddenly the smile came back.

This is an atom: 
"But if I'm to
be Billy Wiggs's model, I guess I'd better go to bed.

This is an atom: 
WIGGS AT HOME

    "She had a sunny nature that sought, like
    a flower in a dark place, for the light.

This is an atom: 
She was deep in
thought when the door opened and Aunt Chloe came in with a basket
and a note.

This is an atom: 
The old darky grinned as she put the basket on the floor.

This is an atom: 
"You might
'a' knowed, it wuz fum dem Wiggses," she said.

This is an atom: 
Me and the
childern want to send you a crismas mess of some of all we lade in
for to live on.

This is an atom: 
I boughten the peeches last sumer, they
was gitting a little rotting so I got them cheep.

This is an atom: 
" cried Lucy; "that's the biggest widow's mite
I ever saw.

This is an atom: 
"

She went over to the fire, and held her hands to the friendly blaze;
there was a restless, discontented look in her eyes that proved only
too plainly that her Christmas was not a happy one.

This is an atom: 
Mother
is asleep; it's too early for callers.

This is an atom: 
"

Aunt Chloe stuck out her lip and rolled her eyes in deprecation.

This is an atom: 
What you wanter be foolin' 'round wif dat
po' white trash fer?

This is an atom: 
Why don' you set heah by de fiah an' bleach yer
han's fer de party to-might?

This is an atom: 
She had begun
disobeying Aunt Chloe when she was a very little girl.

This is an atom: 
Fifteen minutes later she was tramping through the snow, her cheeks
glowing and her spirits rising.

This is an atom: 
The Wiggses, while always
interesting, had of late acquired a new significance.

This is an atom: 
Since seeing
them in the theater lobby with Robert Redding she had found it
necessary to make several visits to the Cabbage Patch, and the chief
topic of conversation had been Mr.

This is an atom: 
Bob: how he had taken them to the
show; had made Billy his office-boy; had sent them a barrel of
apples, and was coming to see them some day.

This is an atom: 
To which deluge of
information Lucy had listened with outward calmness and inward
thrills.

This is an atom: 
To-day, as she entered the Wiggses' gate a shout greeted her.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, who had hastened
out to meet her.

This is an atom: 
Billy's hand wasn't
so bad hurt he couldn't shoot his gum-bow shooter and break Miss
Krasmier's winder-pane.

This is an atom: 
I'll be glad when to-morrow comes, an' he
goes back to the office!

This is an atom: 
That's right; now, lemme help you off
with yer things.

This is an atom: 
A center rush ensued, during which the muff was threatened with
immediate annihilation.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs had long ago discovered
the most effectual way of punishing Europena.

This is an atom: 
When peace was restored, Lucy looked about her.

This is an atom: 
In each window was a
piece of holly tied with a bit of red calico, and on the partly
cleared table she saw the remains of a real Christmas dinner.

This is an atom: 
Bob sent the turkey; we et all we wanted, an' got
'nough left fer the rest of the week, countin' hash an' soup an'
all.

This is an atom: 
Asia says she's goin' to hide it, so as I can't give no more
away.

This is an atom: 
By the way, do you notice what Asia's doin'?

This is an atom: 
"

Lucy went to the window, where Asia was busily working.

This is an atom: 
"What are you making?

This is an atom: 
" she asked, as the child dipped a brush into
one of three cans which stood before her.

This is an atom: 
"Looked
like she was jes' crazy 'bout picture painting, an' I said, 'Well,
Asia, if you have made up yer mind to be a artist, guess you'll
have to be one.

This is an atom: 
' Seems like when folks kin do pianner playin' an'
picture paintin' it ain't right to let 'em wash dishes an' clean up
all the time.

This is an atom: 
So I went to a store an' ast fer some paint to make
pictures with, and they wanted seventy cents fer a little box full.

This is an atom: 
Ain't that a mighty heap, Miss Lucy, jes' fer plain paint, 'fore it
's made up into flowers an' trees an' things?

This is an atom: 
Becker's paint-shop, an' he poured me a little red an'
yaller an' blue, an' only charged me a nickel, an' throwed in a
brush.

This is an atom: 
"

It was not necessary, for in every direction Lucy looked her eyes
were greeted with specimens of Asia's handiwork.

This is an atom: 
Across the
foot-board of the bed was a spray of what might have passed for
cauliflower, the tin boiler was encircled by a wreath of
impressionistic roses, and on the window-pane a piece of exceedingly
golden goldenrod bent in an obliging curve in order to cover the
crack in the glass.

This is an atom: 
"Sometimes I jes' can't believe my eyes, when I
see what my childern kin do!

This is an atom: 
"

Lucy made a heroic effort to keep a solemn face, as she asked if
Asia looked like him.

This is an atom: 
I remember when he fus' come a-courtin' me folks thought
he was a Dago.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs had been keepin' company with
me fer 'bout two weeks he drove up one night with a load of coal an'
kindlin', an' called pa out to the fence.

This is an atom: 
Smoot,' sez he, 'as
long as I am courtin' your daughter, I think I orter furnish the
fire to do it by.

This is an atom: 
I 'spect by the time it's
used up Nance'll be of my way of think-in'.

This is an atom: 
"How is Billy getting along?

This is an atom: 
I give him money to ride, but ever' day last week he et up his
nickel.

This is an atom: 
"

"Who--who has charge of him now?

This is an atom: 
Wiggs; "he's the gentleman that took us to
supper.

This is an atom: 
Bob; says he's goin' to be
jes' like him when he grows up.

This is an atom: 
Why, when Mr.

This is an atom: 
"

Lucy's eyes were fixed on the mammoth butterfly upon whose
iridescent wings Asia was putting the finishing touches, but her
thoughts were far away.

This is an atom: 
" said Lucy, with such fervor that Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"I have been driving all over the country looking for you," said a
man's voice.

This is an atom: 
"

Lucy rose hastily, and turned just as Redding entered.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, triumphantly;
"she was jes' 'lowin' she'd like to see you.

This is an atom: 
"

If a blue-eyed angel straight from the peaks of paradise had been
presented to him, Redding could not have been more astounded nor
more enraptured.

This is an atom: 
During the long silence of the past year she had persuaded herself
that Redding no longer cared for her.

This is an atom: 
"Do you know where my muff is, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes, I must go," said Lucy, hurriedly, "if you will find my muff.

This is an atom: 
"

She stood nervously pulling on her gloves, while Mrs.

This is an atom: 
There was a deafening tumult in her heart,
and though she bit her lips to keep from laughing, the tears stood
in her eyes.

This is an atom: 
"Austry's under the bed," announced Europena, who had joined in the
quest.

This is an atom: 
" came in shrill, indignant tones, as Mrs.

This is an atom: 
I am going that way.

This is an atom: 
" It was
Redding's voice, but it sounded queer and unnatural.

This is an atom: 
No, thank you," gasped Lucy, hardly knowing what she said.

This is an atom: 
Her one idea was to get away before she broke down completely.

This is an atom: 
Redding held the door open as she passed out.

This is an atom: 
His face was cold,
calm, inscrutable; not a quiver of the mouth, not a flutter of the
lids, but the light went out of his eyes and hope died in his heart.

This is an atom: 
"I dunno what ailed Miss Lucy," she said, apologetically; "hope it
wasn't the toothache.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER IX

HOW SPRING CAME TO THE CABBAGE PATCH

    "The roads, the woods, the heavens, the hills
    Are not a world to-day--
    But just a place God made for us
    In which to play.

This is an atom: 
"

WHEN the last snow of the winter had melted, and the water was no
longer frozen about the corner pump, the commons lost their hard,
brown look, and a soft green tinge appeared instead.

This is an atom: 
There were not
many ways of telling when spring came to the Cabbage Patch; no trees
shook forth their glad little leaves of welcome, no anemones and
snow-drops brought the gentle message, even the birds that winged
their way from the South-land hurried by, without so much as a chirp
of greeting.

This is an atom: 
But the Cabbage Patch knew it was spring, nevertheless; something
whispered it in the air, a dozen little signs gave the secret away;
weeds were springing up in the fence corners, the puddles which a
few months ago were covered with ice now reflected bits of blue sky,
and the best token of all was the bright, warm sunshine that clung
to the earth as if to love it back into beauty and life again.

This is an atom: 
It
was the first time he had been there since Christmas day, for his
first visit had been too painful for him to desire to repeat it.

This is an atom: 
"I'm mighty
glad you drove him by home to git on his good coat.

This is an atom: 
How's Mr.

This is an atom: 
"

"He was takin' a nap o' sleep when I went to clean up this mornin',"
said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs saw the shadow on his face, and hastened to change the
subject.

This is an atom: 
"What do you think of Asia's fence?

This is an atom: 
Chris Hazy, that boy over yonder
with the peg-stick, helped her dig the post-boles, but she done the
rest herself.

This is an atom: 
" said Redding, almost incredulously, as
he examined the fence and sidewalk.

This is an atom: 
"How old is she?

This is an atom: 
"

The girl left the flower-bed she was digging, and came forward.

This is an atom: 
"How
would you like to go up to the tile factory, and learn to do
decorating?

This is an atom: 
"

Her serious face lit up with great enthusiasm; she forgot her
shyness, and said, eagerly: "Oh, yes, sir!

This is an atom: 
Last fall she built that there little greenhouse out of
ole planks, an' kep' it full of flowers all winter; put a lamp in
durin' the cold spell.

This is an atom: 
You orter see the things she's painted.

This is an atom: 
She could jes' take some of that there mud
under that hoss's feet, an' make it look so much like you, you 
wouldn't know which was which.

This is an atom: 
"You come to the office with Billy in the morning," he called to
Asia, as they started off; "we'll see what can be done.

This is an atom: 
"

Asia went back to her digging with a will; the prospect of work, of
learning how to do things right, and, above all, of learning how to
paint, filled her with happiness.

This is an atom: 
"If I was you I'd make that bed in the shape of a star," said her
mother, breaking in on her rejections.

This is an atom: 
"Why don't you make it a
mason star?

This is an atom: 
"

"What is a mason star like?

This is an atom: 
Lands alive, I do believe there comes Miss
Lucy!

This is an atom: 
Here, of course, she heard a great
deal about the Eichorns, the elite of the Cabbage Patch, whose
domestic infelicities furnished the chief interest in Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Lucy had even stood on a chair, at the invalid's earnest
request, to count the jars of preserves in the Eichorn pantry.

This is an atom: 
Later
she had become acquainted with Miss Hazy, the patient little woman
in monochrome, whose whole pitiful existence was an apology when it
might have been a protest.

This is an atom: 
She
was sought for advice, called upon for comfort, and asked to share
many joys.

This is an atom: 
Her approach was usually heralded by a shout, "That's
her a-comin'!

This is an atom: 
" and she was invariably escorted across the commons by
a guard of ragged but devoted youngsters.

This is an atom: 
And the friendship of
these simple people opened her eyes to the great problems of
humanity, and as she worked among them and knew life as it was, the
hard little bud of her girlhood blossomed into the great soft rose
of womanhood.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, as she
led the way into the kitchen.

This is an atom: 
I don't see how you missed 'em!

This is an atom: 
If he'd
a sawn you with them vi'lets in yer belt, an' them roses in yer
cheeks, I bet he wouldn't 'a' went.

This is an atom: 
"Who said so?

This is an atom: 
I said they was regular star-eyes, jes' shining
blue with them black eyelashes rayin' out all 'round, an' he said
yes, that was the right name fer 'em--star-eyes.

This is an atom: 
"

There was a mist over the star-eyes as Lucy turned away.

This is an atom: 
"That's right; set right down there by the winder.

This is an atom: 
It's so pretty
out today it makes you feel good clean down yer back.

This is an atom: 
"

"I believe you always feel that way," said Lucy, pulling off her
gloves.

This is an atom: 
"Some folks goes right under when trouble comes, but I
carry mine fur an' easy.

This is an atom: 
"

"I don't mean grieving," said Lucy; "I mean worrying and fretting.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, taking a hot iron from the stove,
"I 've done that, too.

This is an atom: 
I remember onct last winter I was tooken
sick, an' I got to pesterin' 'bout what the childern 'ud do if I
died.

This is an atom: 
They wasn't no money in the house, an' they didn't know
where to git none.

This is an atom: 
By an' by I was so miserable I ast
the Lord what I mus' do, an' he tole me.

This is an atom: 
'

"Then I tole him all 'bout it, an' ast him if he wouldn't take my
body after I was gone, an' give the money to the childern.

This is an atom: 
'

"So he drawed up the papers, an' we both signed, an' a man with a
spine in his back an' a lady with the rheumatiz witnessed it.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, "I didn't die; you mark my words, it
ain't never no use puttin' up yer umbrell' till it rains!

This is an atom: 
"Well, you certainly practise what you preach.

This is an atom: 
"I'm 'feared I use' to worry some
over Mr.

This is an atom: 
"But no matter how bad he done, he always tried to do better.

This is an atom: 
"

"Who is Mr.

This is an atom: 
I clean up his room ever'
mornin' He coughs all the time, jes' like Mr.

This is an atom: 
Other day
he had a orful spell while I was there.

This is an atom: 
I wanted to git him some
whisky, but he shuck his head.

This is an atom: 
You orter see him watch fer Mr.

This is an atom: 
He sets by the
winder, all propped up with pillars, an' never tecks his eyes offen
that corner.

This is an atom: 
Bob comes in an' sets down by him an'
tells him what's goin' on, an' sorter fools with him a spell, looks
like he picks up right off.

This is an atom: 
That's right, too.

This is an atom: 
I hold that it's wrong to keep
ever'thing bottled up inside you.

This is an atom: 
Yer feelin's is like ras'berry
vineger: if you 're skeered to use 'em an' keep on savin' 'em, first
thing you know they 've done 'vaporated!

This is an atom: 
"

Lucy's experience had proved the contrary, but she smiled bravely
back at Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"You have taught me lots of things!

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, I guess I ain't the best by a long sight, but I may be the
happiest.

This is an atom: 
An' I got cause to be: four of the smartest childern that
ever lived, a nice house, fair to middlin' health when I ain't got
the rheumatiz, and folks always goin' clean out of the way to be
good to one!

This is an atom: 
Ain't that 'nough to make a person happy?

This is an atom: 
Lots of folks is walkin' 'round jes' as
dead as they'll ever be.

This is an atom: 
I believe in gittin' as much good outen
life as you kin--not that I ever set out to look fer happiness;
seems like the folks that does that never finds it.

This is an atom: 
I jes' do the
best I kin where the good Lord put me at, an' it looks like I got a
happy feelin' in me 'most all the time.

This is an atom: 
"Here is a dress I brought for Asia," she said, shaking out the
folds of a soft crepon.

This is an atom: 
"It does seem lucky that
your leavin's jes' fits Asia, an' Asia's jes' fits Austry; there
ain't no symptoms of them bein' handed down, neither!

This is an atom: 
We all model
right after you, but it looks like Asia's the only one that ketches
yer style.

This is an atom: 
" she added, as Lucy picked up her
gloves.

This is an atom: 
" It was an unwritten law that no guest should depart
without a gift of some kind.

This is an atom: 
Sometimes it was one of Asia's
paintings, again it was a package of sunflower seed, or a bottle of
vinegar, and once Lucy had taken home four gourds and a bunch of
paper roses.

This is an atom: 
"I declare I never will git no work done if this weather keeps up!

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, as she held the gate open.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER X

AUSTRALIA'S MISHAP

    "'T is one thing to be tempted,
    Another thing to fall.

This is an atom: 
Around the corner of
the shed which served as Cuba's dwelling-place, Australia and
Europena made mud-pies.

This is an atom: 
Peace and harmony reigned in this shabby
Garden of Eden until temptation entered, and the weakest fell.

This is an atom: 
"'T ain't no fun jes' keepin' on makin' mud-pies," announced
Australia, after enough pastry had been manufactured to start a
miniature bakery.

This is an atom: 
I'll tell you what's let do!

This is an atom: 
"

After some time the desired object was discovered on a shelf in the
shed.

This is an atom: 
"Do you reckon you
could hol' the chair while I climbed up on the back?

This is an atom: 
"

"Well, it don't need to have no bottom if I'm goin' to stand on its
back," said Australia, sharply.

This is an atom: 
"You might git killed," persisted Europena.

This is an atom: 
'Fore you was
borned I was drowned out in the country, that was one time; then I
fell in the ash-bar'l and was dead, that's two times; an'--an'
then I et the stove-polish, that's four times; an' I can't 'member,
but the nex' time will be seven.

This is an atom: 
I don't keer how much I git killed,
till it's eight times, then I'm goin' to be good all the time,
'cause when you are dead nine times they put you in a hole an' throw
dirt on you!

This is an atom: 
"

Australia had become so absorbed in her theory of reincarnation that
she had forgotten the paint, but the bottomless chair recalled it.

This is an atom: 
Europena, though violently opposed to the undertaking, would not
forsake her leader at a critical moment.

This is an atom: 
She had uttered her
protest, had tried in vain to stem the current of events; nothing
was left her now but to do or die.

This is an atom: 
Cuba looked mildly astonished as the plump figure of the little girl
appeared above his feed-box.

This is an atom: 
" cried Australia, reaching as high as possible,
and getting her forefinger over the edge of the big can.

This is an atom: 
At this juncture Cuba, whose nose had doubtless been tickled by
Australia's apron-string, gave a prodigious sneeze.

This is an atom: 
Europena,
feeling that retribution was upon them, fled in terror.

This is an atom: 
The ballast
being removed from the chair, the result was inevitable.

This is an atom: 
A crash, a
heterogeneous combination of small girl, green paint, and shattered
chair, then a series of shrieks that resembled the whistles on New
Year's eve!

This is an atom: 
He had just driven Billy to the
gate when the screams began, and with a bound he was out of the
buggy and rushing to the scene of disaster.

This is an atom: 
The picture that met his
eyes staggered him.

This is an atom: 
Australia, screaming wildly, lay in what
appeared to his excited vision to be a pool of green blood; Europena
was jumping up and down beside her, calling wildly for her mother,
while Cuba, with ears erect and a green liquid trickling down his
nose, sternly surveyed the wreck.

This is an atom: 
In a moment Redding had Australia
in his arms, and was mopping the paint from her face and hair.

This is an atom: 
" he was saying,
as Mrs.

This is an atom: 
The damage done proved external rather than internal, so after
assuring herself that no bones were broken Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Now, we'll all go up
to the kitchen, an' see what kin be did.

This is an atom: 
"

Now, Fate, or it may have been the buggy at the gate, decreed that
just as they turned the corner of the house, Lucy Olcott should be
coming up the walk.

This is an atom: 
For a moment she stood bewildered at the sight
that greeted her.

This is an atom: 
Redding, in his shirt sleeves, was leading
Australia by the hand; the little girl wore a red-flannel petticoat,
and over her face and hands and to the full length of her flaxen
braids ran sticky streams of bright green paint.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs, coming up; "it might 'a' put her eyes out.

This is an atom: 
"

Billy was despatched for turpentine; Lucy, with an apron pinned
about her, began operations on Australia's hair, while Redding sat
helplessly by, waiting for Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"I am afraid her hair will have to be cut," said Lucy, ruefully, as
she held up a tangled snarl of yellow and green.

This is an atom: 
"I ain't goin' to have my hair cut off!

This is an atom: 
"Well, if you will let Miss Olcott cut off all that ugly green hair,
and give the pretty curls a chance to grow back, I'll give you--
let's see, what shall I give you?

This is an atom: 
"

"A doll-buggy an' dishes," suggested Europena, who was standing by.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," he said, "doll-buggy and dishes, and a dollar besides!

This is an atom: 
Australia suffered herself
to be shorn, in view of the future tempering of the wind.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs,
admiringly, when the deed was accomplished; "yer voice jes' makes
folks do things!

This is an atom: 
"Where do you suppose Billy's went with the turkentine?

This is an atom: 
I declare
that boy would be a good one to send after trouble!

This is an atom: 
" she said, as Redding insisted
on putting on his coat.

This is an atom: 
As he turned to the door, a light hand touched his arm.

This is an atom: 
For a moment neither spoke, but her
eyes made the silence eloquent; they told the secret that her lips
dared not utter.

This is an atom: 
There are times when explanations are superfluous.

This is an atom: 
Redding threw discretion to the winds, and, regardless of Wiggses
and consequences, took the "Christmas Lady" in his arms, and kissed
away the year of grief and separation.

This is an atom: 
It was not until Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs saw their trap disappear in the twilight
that she recovered her speech.

This is an atom: 
"I 've heard of
'painters' colic,' but I never knowed it to go to the head before!

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XI

THE BENEFIT DANCE

    "Those there are whose hearts have a slope
    southward, and are open to the whole
    noon of Nature.

This is an atom: 
"

NOTWITHSTANDING the fact that calamities seldom come singly, it was
not until the Fourth of July that the Cabbage Patch was again the
scene of an accident.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs had been hanging out clothes, and was turning to pick up
the empty basket, when Billy precipitated himself into the yard,
yelling wildly:

"Chris Hazy's broke his leg!

This is an atom: 
Where's he at?

This is an atom: 
"Don't let on to Miss Hazy till we
git him in," she cautioned, snatching up a bundle of rags and a
bottle of liniment.

This is an atom: 
How it must hurt him!

This is an atom: 
"

She was breathless and trembling from excitement as she turned the
corner at Mrs.

This is an atom: 
A crowd of boys were coming up the track,
trundling a wheelbarrow, in which sat Chris Hazy, the merriest of
the lot, waving a piece of his wooden leg in the air.

This is an atom: 
I said he broke his leg," the boy gasped out as
best be could for laughing, "an' you never ast which one.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs laughed with the rest, but only
for a moment, for she spied Miss Hazy tottering toward them, and she
hastened forward to relieve her anxiety.

This is an atom: 
"Don't make much difference which one 't was," she sobbed; "it would
be 'bout as easy to git another sure-'nough leg as to git a new
wooden one.

This is an atom: 
That las' one cost seven dollars.

This is an atom: 
I jes' sewed an' saved
an' scrimped to git it, an' now it's--busted!

This is an atom: 
"

The boys stood around in silent sympathy, and when nobody was
looking Chris wiped his eyes on his coat sleeve.

This is an atom: 
"Boys," she said, and her voice had an inspiring ring, "I'll tell
you what let's do!

This is an atom: 
Every feller that's willin' to help,
hol' up his hand.

This is an atom: 
"

A dozen grimy hands were waved on high, and offers of assistance
came from all sides.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs saw that now was the time to utilize
their enthusiasm.

This is an atom: 
"I'll go right back to the house, an' git Asia to write out the
tickets, an' all you boys kin sell ten apiece.

This is an atom: 
Miss Hazy, you kin
come over an' help me git the house ready, an' we'll put Chris to
cleanin' lamp-chimbleys.

This is an atom: 
"

Under this able generalship, the work was soon under way; the boys
were despatched with the tickets, and the house was being put
straight--at least the parlor was.

This is an atom: 
It would have required many
days to restore order to the chaos that habitually existed in the
house of Wiggs.

This is an atom: 
"Asia, you help me roll these here barrels out on the porch, an' I
'll mop up the floor," said Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"Miss Hazy, you look 'round
in the kitchen, an' see if you can't find a taller candle.

This is an atom: 
Seems
like I put one in the sugar-bowl--that's it!

This is an atom: 
Now, if you'll jes'
cut it up right fine it'll be all ready to put on the floor when I
git done.

This is an atom: 
"

When the floor was dry and the candle sprinkled over it, Australia
and Europena were detailed to slide upon it until it became slick.

This is an atom: 
"Would you ast ever'body to bring a cheer, or would you have 'em
already here?

This is an atom: 
" insisted Asia, who had been to a
church social.

This is an atom: 
So a raid was made on the neighborhood, and every available chair
borrowed and ranged against the parlor wall.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs
received the funds, which amounted to six dollars.

This is an atom: 
It being a holiday, everybody was glad to come to the dance,
especially as the proceeds were to help little Miss Hazy.

This is an atom: 
At one time there threatened to be trouble about the music; some
wanted Uncle Tom, the old negro who usually fiddled at the dances,
and others preferred to patronize home talent and have Jake Schultz,
whose accordion could be heard at all hours in the Cabbage Patch.

This is an atom: 
"They kin take turn about," she
argued; "when one gits tired, the other kin pick up right where he
left oft, an' the young folks kin shake the'r feet till they shoes
drop off.

This is an atom: 
Uncle Tom an' Jake, too, is a heap sight better than them
mud-gutter bands that play 'round the streets.

This is an atom: 
"

"Wisht we could fix the yard up some," said Asia, when there was
nothing more to be done in the parlor.

This is an atom: 
what's John Bagby a-bringing' in here?

This is an atom: 
"

The grocery boy, staggering under the weight of an ice-cream freezer
and carrying something wrapped in white paper, came up the path.

This is an atom: 
John was cross-eyed, so
Miss Hazy thought he looked at Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"How'd they ever know it was my birthday?

This is an atom: 
"Why, I'd even forgot it myself!

This is an atom: 
Somehow, I never feel like good things b'long to
me till I pass 'em on to somebody else.

This is an atom: 
"

This necessitated a supply of saucers and spoons, and friends were
again called upon to provide as many as possible.

This is an atom: 
The Wiggses were quite busy until seven o'clock, when they stopped
to make their toilets.

This is an atom: 
Search was made, and she was
discovered standing on a chair in a corner of the parlor, calmly
eating the cinnamon drops off the birthday cake.

This is an atom: 
Billy was
so indignant that he insisted on immediate punishment.

This is an atom: 
Besides, the cake ain't spoiled; it's jes'
a 'N' now, 'stid of a 'W,' an' N stands fer Nancy jes' as good as W
stands fer Wiggs!

This is an atom: 
Krasmier; he had paid ten cents
toward the refreshments, and proposed to get his money's worth.

This is an atom: 
Eichorn came early, too, but for a different reason; she was very
stout, and her happiness for the evening depended largely upon the
size of the chair she secured.

This is an atom: 
Her
delay was caused by the loss of her false curls, which she had not
worn since the memorable night at the Opera House.

This is an atom: 
They were very
black and very frizzled, and had been bought at a reduced price from
a traveling salesman some ten years before.

This is an atom: 
Hence
consternation prevailed when they could not be found.

This is an atom: 
Drawers were
upset and boxes emptied, but with no success.

This is an atom: 
When hope was about abandoned, Asia suddenly darted out to the shed
where the children kept their play-things.

This is an atom: 
When she returned she
triumphantly displayed a battered doll, armless and footless, but
with a magnificent crowning glory of black, frizzed hair.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs waited until all the guests assembled before she made her
speech of thanks for the cake and cream.

This is an atom: 
It was a very fine speech,
having been written out beforehand by Mr.

This is an atom: 
It began, "Ladies
and gents, it gives me pleasure--" but before Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs got half
through she forgot it, and had to tell them in her own way how
grateful she was.

This is an atom: 
In conclusion she said: "Couldn't nobody be more
obliged than what I am!

This is an atom: 
The musicianers have come, so we
'll begin the party with a Virginer reel.

This is an atom: 
"

The young people scampered to their places, and when Mr.

This is an atom: 
Wiggs she laughingly took her place at the head
of the line, and at the first strains of "Old Dan Tucker" she went
down the middle with a grace and spirit that flatly contradicted the
little red fifty on the birthday cake.

This is an atom: 
"

Old Uncle Tom was warming up to his work, and the fun waxed furious.

This is an atom: 
Asia, looking very pretty in her new crepon, cast shy glances at Joe
Eichorn, who had been "keeping company" of late.

This is an atom: 
Billy, for whom
there was no room in the reel, let off his energy in the corner by a
noisy execution of the "Mobile Buck.

This is an atom: 
When the dance ended, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
She
was completely out of breath, and her false front had worked its way
down over her eyebrows

"Look--comin', ma!

This is an atom: 
Wiggs saw who it was she hastened down to the gate.

This is an atom: 
"

"No, thanks," said Redding, trying in vain not to look at Mrs.

This is an atom: 
What would you say if
I told you that I was going to marry the prettiest, sweetest,
dearest girl in the world?

This is an atom: 
"

"Why, that's Miss Lucy!

This is an atom: 
" She did
not have to tell them; her eyes, though suffering a partial eclipse,
fairly beamed with joy and satisfaction.

This is an atom: 
"

When they had driven away, she lingered a moment at the gate.

This is an atom: 
Music
and laughter came from the house behind her, as she stood smiling
out across the moonlit Cabbage Patch.

This is an atom: 
Her face still held the
reflected happiness of the departed lovers, as the sky holds the
rose-tints after the sun has gone.

This is an atom: 
"An' they 're goin' to git married," she whispered softly to
herself; "an' Billy's got promoted, an' Asia's got a place, an'
Chris'll have a new peg-stick.

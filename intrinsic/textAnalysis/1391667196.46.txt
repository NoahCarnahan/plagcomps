This is an atom: 
ï»¿Lon ceased questioning, dismissing the subject with a suggestion that he himself should reconnoiter
the ground. He left Lem, groped his way among the gravestones for several yards, and brought
up abruptly at the fence. From here he eyed the Brimbecomb mansion for some minutes; then he
cast his glance to the steps of the Shellington home beyond. After a few seconds a young man
ran down the stairs, and Lon slunk back to Lem in the toolhouse. An instant later both men
were startled by the cry of an owl. Lem rose uneasily, while Lon stared into the darkness.

This is an atom: 
"That weren't a real owl, were it, Lon?" Lem muttered.

This is an atom: 
"Nope," growled Lon; "it sounded more like Scraggy."

This is an atom: 
He looked at the one-armed man with suspicion.

This is an atom: 
"Can't prove it by me," said Lem darkly.

This is an atom: 
"Do ye know where she ever goes to?" demanded Cronk.

This is an atom: 
Lem shook his head in negation.

This is an atom: 
Crabbe dared not venture out again alone; for apprehension rose strong within him. He knew
that Scraggy had left the settlement to find their boy. Had she come to Tarrytown for him?
The two men crouched low, and talked no more during some minutes. Finally, Lon, bidding Lem
follow him, lifted his big body, and they left the toolhouse. The squatter led the way to the
fence. They stood there for a time watching in silence. Two shadows appeared upon a curtain
of the house before them. A man was lifting a woman in his arms, and the downward fall of her
head gave evidence of her unconsciousness. As the front door opened, the squatter and the scowman
retreated to their quarters. When Everett Brimbecomb threw the body of Screech Owl into the
cemetery, both were peering out. They saw the man carry the figure off into the shadows, marking
that he returned alone. Neither knew that the other was Scraggy; but, with a lust for mystery
and evil, they slipped out with no word. Lon made off to view the Shellington home once more,
and Lem disappeared in the direction from which Everett had come, easily following the tracks
in the snow. Coming within sight of the vault, Lem rounded it fearfully. On the ground he saw
the woman, and as he looked she rose to a sitting position.

This is an atom: 
Screech Owl was just recovering her battered senses. She was still dazed, and had not heard
the scowman's footsteps, nor did she now hear the mutterings in his throat. Faintly she called
to Black Pussy; but, receiving no response from the cat, she crawled deeper into the shadows
of the vault and tried to think. Her fitful whining brought Lem from his hiding place.

This is an atom: 
"Be that you, Owl?" he whispered.

This is an atom: 
"Yep. Where be the black cat?"

This is an atom: 
"I dunno. Where ye been? And how'd ye get here?"

This is an atom: 
Scraggy leaned back against the marble vault in exhaustion.

This is an atom: 
"I dunno. Where be I now?"

This is an atom: 
Lem bent nearer her, shaking her arm roughly.

This is an atom: 
"Ye be in Tarrytown. Did ye come here for the brat?"

This is an atom: 
"What brat be ye talkin' 'bout, Lem?"

This is an atom: 
"Our'n, Screechy. Weren't ye here lookin' for him?"

This is an atom: 
Through the darkness Lem could not see the crazed expression that flashed over Scraggy's face.
She thrust her fingers in her hair and shivered. The blow of Everett's fist had banished all
memory of the boy from her mind; but Lem lived there as vividly as in the olden days.

This is an atom: 
"We ain't got no boy, Lem," she said mournfully.

This is an atom: 
"Ye said we had, Screechy, and I know we have. Now, get up out of that there snow, or ye'll
freeze."

This is an atom: 
The scowman helped Screech Owl to her feet, and supported her back over the graves to the toolhouse.

This is an atom: 
"Ye stay here till I come for ye, Scraggy, and don't ye dare go 'way no place. Do ye hear?"

This is an atom: 
Screech Owl uttered an obedient assent, and Lem left her with a threat that he would beat her
if she moved from the spot. Then he crawled along the Brimbecomb fence, and saw Lon leaning
against a tree, some distance down the road.

CHAPTER NINETEEN

This is an atom: 
After Everett's departure, Ann tripped into Floyd's room in a happier state of mind than had
been hers for several days. It had been her habit to kneel beside the boy at night and send
up a petition for his recovery. Now she would thank God for his goodness to her,--Everett had
come to be more like himself, and Floyd's welcoming smile sent a thrill of joy through her.
As Ann entered, Fledra looked up from her book. Her pale, beseeching face drew Miss Shellington
to her.

This is an atom: 
"Fledra dear, you study too late and too hard. You don't look at all well."

This is an atom: 
"I keep tellin' her that same thing, Sister Ann," said Floyd; "but she keeps mutterin' over
them words till I know 'em myself."

This is an atom: 
Miss Shellington turned Fledra's face up to hers, smoothing down the dark curls.

This is an atom: 
"Go to bed, child; you're absolutely tired out. Kiss me goodnight, Dear."

This is an atom: 
Fledra loitered in the hall until she heard Miss Shellington leave Floyd; then she stole forward.

This is an atom: 
"Will you come to my room a little while, Sister Ann?"

This is an atom: 
Without a word, Ann took the girl's hand; together they entered the blue room.

This is an atom: 
Fledra wheeled about upon Miss Shellington, when the door had been, closed.

This is an atom: 
"Do you believe all those things you pray about, Sister Ann?" she appealed brokenly.

This is an atom: 
Ann questioned Fledra with a look; the girl made clearer her demand by adding:

This is an atom: 
"Do you believe that Jesus hears you when you ask Him something you want very, very bad?"

This is an atom: 
She looked so miserable, so frail and lonely, that Ann put her arms about her.

This is an atom: 
"Sit down here with me, Fledra. There! Put your little tired head right here, and I'll tell
you all I can."

This is an atom: 
"I want to be helped!" murmured Fledra.

This is an atom: 
"I've known that for sometime," Ann said softly; "and I'm so happy that you've come to me!"

This is an atom: 
"It's nothin' you can do; but I was thinkin' that perhaps Jesus could do it."

This is an atom: 
Ann pressed the girl closer.

This is an atom: 
"Is it something you can't tell me?"

This is an atom: 
Fledra nodded.

This is an atom: 
"And you can't tell my brother?"

This is an atom: 
The girl's nervous start filled Ann with dismay; for now she knew that the trouble rested with
Horace. She waited for an answer to her question, and at length Fledra, crestfallen, blurted out:

This is an atom: 
"I can't tell anybody but--"

This is an atom: 
"Jesus?" whispered Ann.

This is an atom: 
"Yes; and I don't know how to tell Him."

This is an atom: 
Ann thought a moment.

This is an atom: 
"Fledra, if you wanted someone to do something for you, about which that person knew nothing,
wouldn't you have to tell it before it could be granted?"

This is an atom: 
Fledra nodded.

This is an atom: 
"Then, that's what you are to do tonight. You are to kneel down here when I am gone, and you
are to feel positively sure that God will help, if you ask Him in Jesus' name. Do you think
you have faith enough to do that?"

This is an atom: 
"I don't know what faith is," replied Fledra in a whisper.

This is an atom: 
"I'll tell you what it is, Dear. Now, then, don't you remember how my brother and I prayed
for Floyd?"

This is an atom: 
Fledra pressed Ann's arm.

This is an atom: 
"And don't you remember, Dear, that almost immediately he was helped?"

This is an atom: 
"You had a doctor," said Fledra slowly.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, for a doctor is God's agent for the good of mankind; but we had faith, too. And in something
like this--Is your trouble illness?"

This is an atom: 
"Only here," answered Flea, laying her hand upon her heart.

This is an atom: 
Ann could not force Flea's confidence; so she said:

This is an atom: 
"Then if it is impossible to confide in Horace, or in me, will you pray tonight, fully believing
that you will be answered? You must remember how much Jesus loved you to come down to suffer
and die for you."

This is an atom: 
"I don't believe I thought that story was true, Sister Ann." Fledra drew back, and looked up
into Ann's shocked face as she spoke, "I shouldn't say I believed it if I didn't, should I?"

This is an atom: 
"No, Darling; but you must believe--you surely must! You must promise me that you will pray
first for faith, then for relief, and tomorrow you will feel better."

This is an atom: 
"I promise," answered Fledra.

This is an atom: 
For many minutes after Ann had left her, the girl lay stretched out upon the bed. Her heart
pained her until it seemed that she must go directly to Horace and confess her secret.

This is an atom: 
She got up slowly at last, and, kneeling, began a whispered petition. It was broken by sobs
and falling tears, by writhings that tore the tender soul offering it.

This is an atom: 
Fledra prayed for Horace, and then stopped.

This is an atom: 
After a time she rose, having done all a girl could do for those she loved, and, undressing,
slowly crawled into bed. Through the darkness as she lay looking upward she tried to imagine
what kind of a being God was, wondering if He were kindly visaged, or if, when His earthly
children sinned, He looked as Horace had looked when she confessed the lie told to Ann. In
her imagination, she framed the Savior of the world like unto the man she loved when he smiled
upon her, and then she believed, and believed mightily. In likening Jesus to Horace--in bringing
the Savior nearer through the lineaments of her loved one--she gathered out of her unbelief
a great belief that He could, and would, smooth away all the troubles that had arisen in her life.

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
That night she turned and tossed for several hours, praying and weeping, weeping and praying,
until from sheer fatigue she lay perfectly quiet. Suddenly she sat up and listened. The stupor
of slumber dulled her hearing, and she struggled to catch again the sound that had awakened
her. From somewhere across the hall she heard a faint click, click, which sounded as though
some mechanic's tool were being used.

This is an atom: 
Fledra slipped from the bed and opened the door stealthily. She crept along the hall in her
bare feet, terrified by the muffled sound, and stopped before the velvet curtains that were
drawn closely across the dining-room doorway. Someone was tampering with the silver chest.

This is an atom: 
For a moment terror almost forced Fledra back to her room without investigating; but the thought
that somebody was stealing Ann's precious family plate caused her to slip her fingers between
the curtains and peep in.

This is an atom: 
The lock of the steel safe was lighted by the rays of a dark-lantern, and Fledra could see
two shadowy figures on the floor before it. One held the light, while the other turned a small
hammer machine containing a slender drill. The girl did not have the courage to scream a warning
to Horace and the servants, and before she could move of a sudden one of the men whispered:

This is an atom: 
"The damn thing is harder'n hell, Lem. I guess I'll take a crack at this here hinge."

This is an atom: 
The name awoke the senses of the trembling girl, and instantly she knew the man who had spoken
to be Lon Cronk. A chill gathered round her heart and froze the very marrow in her bones. She
dropped the curtain and fled back to her room. Standing against the door, she pressed her hands
over her face to stifle the loud breathing. Lem and Lon were robbing the house! She would be
forced then to let thieves have the contents of the safe; for, if Pappy Lon knew that she and
Flukey were housed there, he would take them away. But, if he made off with the plate, no one
would ever know who had done it, and her sick brother would still be safe in Ann's care.

This is an atom: 
"I won't go to 'em. I won't! I won't! They can take the whole thing for all of me!"

This is an atom: 
She turned sharply as though she had heard a voice that had made answer to her. With her faculties
benumbed by the terror of the men in the dining-room, and yet remembering that her grief had
been subdued, she turned her face upward, and fancied she saw the Christ-man, so like Horace,
descending into the room. But the face, instead of smiling at her, looked melancholy and sad.

This is an atom: 
It was the dawn of a lasting belief in the Son of God, her first real vision of Him. She gazed
steadily at the beautiful apparition, and then said haltingly:

This is an atom: 
"I'm goin' back to stop 'em, and if Pappy Lon takes me back to the squatter settlement then
help me if ye can, dear Jesus!"

This is an atom: 
The struggle was over, and with rigid desperation Fledra again opened the door and stepped
into the hall. Gliding swiftly along to the entrance of the dining-room, she flung aside the
curtains and appeared like a shade before Lem and Lon.

This is an atom: 
The squatter saw her first; but in the semidarkness did not recognize her. He lifted his arm,
and a flash of steel sent her trembling backward.

This is an atom: 
"Don't open yer mug, Kid, or I'll shoot yer head off!"

This is an atom: 
Then he recognized her, and stepped back to Lem's side.

This is an atom: 
"It's Flea, it's Flea Cronk!" he gasped.

This is an atom: 
The girl advanced into the room.

This is an atom: 
"What do you want here, Pappy Lon? Did you come to steal?"

This is an atom: 
She saw Lem grimacing at her through the rays of the lantern. The scowman looked so evil, so
awful, as he grinningly raised his steel hook, that her faith very nearly fled. Crabbe's heavy
face was working with violent emotion. His full neck moved with horrid convulsions, while a
discord of low noises came from his throat. The girl, clad in her white nightgown, under which
he could trace the slender body, filled him again with passionate longing.

This is an atom: 
"By God! it's little Flea!" he exclaimed at last.

This is an atom: 
"Yep," threw back Lon. "We found somethin' we didn't expect--eh, Lem?"

This is an atom: 
"Did you come to steal?" Fledra demanded again, this time looking at the canalman.

This is an atom: 
"Yep; but we didn't know that you was here, Flea."

This is an atom: 
"Then you won't take anything--now, will you?"

This is an atom: 
"We don't go till you come with us, Flea!" Lon moved nearer her as he spoke. "Ye be my brat,
and ye'll come home with yer pappy!"

This is an atom: 
Fledra choked for breath.

This is an atom: 
"I can't go with you tonight," she replied, bending over in supplication. "Flukey's sick here,
and I have to stay."

This is an atom: 
"Sick! Sick, ye say?" Cronk exclaimed.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, he's been in bed ever since we left home, and he can't walk, and I won't go without him."

This is an atom: 
"I'll take ye both," said Lon ferociously. "I'll come after ye, and I'll kill the man what
keeps ye away from me! I'm a thinkin' a man can have his own brats!"

This is an atom: 
Fledra did not set up an argument upon this point. She wanted to get the men out of the house,
so that she might think out a plan to save her brother and herself.

This is an atom: 
"Ye'll have to let Flukey stay until he gets well, and then mebbe we'll come back."

This is an atom: 
"There ain't no mebbe about it," growled Lon. "Ye'll come when I say it, and Lem ain't through
with ye yet, nuther! Be ye, Lem?"

This is an atom: 
Never, since the children had left his hut, had Lon felt such a desire to torture them. The
dead woman seemed to call out to him for revenge. The wish for the Shellington baubles and
the money he might find was nothing compared to the delight he would feel in dragging the twins
back to Ithaca. Granny Cronk was there no longer, and everything would go his way! He put out
his hand and touched Crabbe.

This is an atom: 
"We ain't goin' to steal nothin' in this house, Lem," he said sullenly; "but I'll come tomorry
and take the kids. Then we be done with this town. Ye'll get yer brother ready by tomorry mornin'.
Ye hear, Flea?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes," answered Flea dully.

This is an atom: 
"If Flukey be too sick to walk, he can ride. I've got the money, and all I want be you two
brats, and, if ye don't come when I tell ye to, then it'll be worse for them what's harborin'
ye. And don't ye so much as breathe to the man what owns this house that we was here tonight--or--I'll
kill Flukey when I get him back to the shanty!"

This is an atom: 
His glance took in the beautiful room, and, unable to suppress a smile, he taunted:

This is an atom: 
"I'm a thinkin' ye'll see a difference 'tween the hut and this place--eh, Flea?"

This is an atom: 
"And between this and the scow," chuckled Lem.

This is an atom: 
"Yep, 'tween this an' the scow," repeated Lon. "Come on, Lem. We'll go now, an' tomorry we'll
come for ye, Flea. No man ain't no right to keep another man's kids."

This is an atom: 
Fledra's past experiences with her squatter father were still so vivid in her mind that she
made no further appeal to him; for she feared to suffer again the humiliation of a blow before
Lem. She stood near the table, shivering, her teeth chattering, and her body swaying with fright
and cold. To whom did she dare turn? Not to Ann or to Horace; for Lon had forbidden it. To
tell Flukey would only make him very ill again. Lon was advancing toward her as these thoughts
raced through her mind. She drew back when he thrust out one of his horny hands.

This is an atom: 
"I ain't a goin' to hit ye, Flea; but I'm goin' to make ye know that I ain't goin' to have
no foolin', and that ye belong to me, and so does Flukey, and that, when I come for ye, ye're
to have yer duds ready."

This is an atom: 
Lem neared the open window, and Lon turned to follow him.

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
For fully three minutes after they had gone, the girl stood watching the black hole through
which they had disappeared, where now the snow came fluttering in. Then she crept forward and
lowered the window noiselessly. With swift footsteps she ran back through the hall and into
the bedroom. After turning on the light, she drew on a dressing-gown and slipped her feet into
a pair of red slippers.

This is an atom: 
Somewhere from the story above came the sound of footfalls, and then the creaking of stairs.
The girl stood holding her hand over her beating heart. A servant, or possibly Ann, had heard
the noises and was coming down. Suddenly into her mind came the prayer Floyd loved.

This is an atom: 
"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild, look upon a little child."

This is an atom: 
She said the words over several times; but had ceased whispering when a low knock came upon
her door. She opened it, and saw Horace standing in his dressing-gown and slippers. For a moment
she looked at him with almost unseeing eyes, and her lips moved tremulously, as if she would
speak and could not. Horace, noticing her agitation, spoke first.

This is an atom: 
"Fledra, I thought I heard you. I looked down and saw a light shining from your window. Is
anything the matter?"

This is an atom: 
Fledra could not find her voice to reply. She had not expected him, and, locking her fingers
tightly together, she stood wide-lidded and trembling.

This is an atom: 
"Were you speaking to someone?" asked Horace.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, I was. I was speaking to Jesus just before you came. I was asking Him to help me."

This is an atom: 
The man looked at the red gown hanging over her white nightrobe, the tossed black curls, and
the pale, sensitive face before he said:

This is an atom: 
"Fledra, whatever is the matter with you? Surely, there is something I can do."

This is an atom: 
"Sister Ann said I would be happier, and we all would, if I asked Jesus; and I was askin' Him
jest now."

This is an atom: 
Horace eyed her dubiously.

This is an atom: 
"It is right to ask Him to help you, of course; but, child, it isn't right for you to act toward
me as you do."

This is an atom: 
Fledra was so desirous of his love and confidence that she made as if to speak. She took two
steps forward, then hesitated. Remembering Ann and the care she had given Floyd, her hand fell
convulsively on the door, and she tried to close it. She dared not tell him of Lon's midnight
visit to the home, and wondered if he would give her up to her squatter father, and let Flukey
be taken back to the settlement.

This is an atom: 
"I told ye the truth when I said I was prayin'," she said; "but I was thinkin', too, if it
was right for a father to have his own children, if he was to ask for 'em."

This is an atom: 
Horace, not understanding her enigmatical words, regarded her gravely.

This is an atom: 
"What a queer girl you are, anyway, Fledra!" he exclaimed. He spoke almost irritably. He felt
like grasping her up and shaking her as one might an obstreperous child.

This is an atom: 
His moody silence made Fledra repeat her words.

This is an atom: 
"I'm sure I don't know what you mean," Horace answered; "but, I suppose, if a father's children
were being kept from him, he could take them if he wished. Fledra, look at me!"

This is an atom: 
She raised her gaze slowly, her somber eyes smiting the watching man as might a blow. Her beseeching
expression arrested the bitter speech that rose to his lips. As the memory of her hard work
gripped him, he bent forward and took her slim, cold hand in his.

This is an atom: 
"Fledra, I want you to pay attention to what I am going to say. I feel sure that you want to
be a good girl. If I were not, I could not bear it. Even if you don't trust me, I'm going to
help you all I can, anyway."

This is an atom: 
"And pray," gasped Fledra, "pray, Brother Horace, that I can be just what you want me to be,
and that I can stay with Floyd in your house!"

This is an atom: 
The girl closed the door quickly in his face, and Shellington moved slowly away, racking his
brain for some solution of the problem.

This is an atom: 
With their minds in a perturbed state, Lem and Lon passed silently back into the cemetery.
The shock of the girl's appearance had awed them both. They were nearing the toolhouse before
Scraggy came into Lem's mind.

This is an atom: 
The whole situation was changed, now that Flea was coming to him. It was the same to him whether
she wanted to come or not; nor did it matter that he had promised Screech Owl that she should
be in the scow. He still wanted his boy to help him with his work; but Scraggy was a person
wholly out of his life.

This is an atom: 
The two men halted in front of the shed.

This is an atom: 
"There be a woman in there," said Lem in a low voice.

This is an atom: 
"What woman?" asked Lon.

This is an atom: 
"Scraggy."

This is an atom: 
"Scraggy! How'd she come in here?"

This is an atom: 
"I took her in," said Lem. "She were the woman what that guy throwed over the fence."

This is an atom: 
Lon pushed his companion aside and pressed through the small doorway. He cast the light of
the lantern about; but no Screech Owl was in sight.

This is an atom: 
"If Scraggy was over here, Lem," he said doubtfully, "then she's gone. We'd better scoot and
get a place to stay all night."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER TWENTY

This is an atom: 
When Fledra entered the breakfast room it was evident to both Ann and Horace that she had had
no sleep. Dark rings had settled under her eyes. The girl had decided that Lon would make good
his threat against the person who should try to keep his children from him, and, if she went
to school, Lem and her father might come when she was gone. As they rose from the table, she
said sullenly:

This is an atom: 
"I'm not goin' to school any more. I don't like that place. I want to stay at home."

This is an atom: 
"Are you ill, Dear?" asked Ann, coming forward.

This is an atom: 
"No, I'm not sick; but I can't go to school."

This is an atom: 
Horace's brow darkened.

This is an atom: 
"That's hardly the way to speak to my sister, Fledra," he chided gently.

This is an atom: 
Ann glanced at him in appeal. Fledra was standing before them, and her eyes dropped under his
words.

This is an atom: 
"If I asked you to let me stay home," she said in a low tone, "you'd both say I couldn't; so
I just had to say that I won't go."

This is an atom: 
Fledra knew no other way to stand guard over the houseful of loved ones. If Lon were to come
while she was gone, he might take her brother. If she told Horace that thieves had entered
his home, and if she named them, that would draw fatal consequences down on Floyd. She could
only hold her peace and let matters take their course. At any rate, she did not intend to go
to school. Now she cast a quick glance at Ann; but kept her eyes studiously from Horace. Noting
Miss Shellington's entreating face, Fledra flung out her hands.

This is an atom: 
"I didn't want to be mean," she said quickly; "but I want you to let me stay home today. Can
I? Please, can I?"

This is an atom: 
"There! I knew that you'd apologize to my sister," Horace said, smiling.

This is an atom: 
At this, Fledra turned upon him. He had never felt a pair of eyes affect him as did hers. How
winsomely sweet she was! It came over him in a flash that he had not dealt quite justly with
her; so he smiled again and held out his hands.

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
During the morning Fledra crept ghostlike about the house. She strained her eyes, now at one
window and then at another, for the first glimpse of Lon. The luncheon hour came and passed,
and still the thieves gave no sign of coming. Horace had returned from his office early in
the afternoon, and was smoking a cigar in the library, when suddenly a loud peal of the doorbell
roused him. Fledra, too, heard it distinctly. She was sitting beside Floyd; but had not dared
to breathe their danger to him. Her cheeks paled at the sound, and she rested silent until
presently summoned to the drawing-room.

This is an atom: 
"What's the matter?" asked her brother.

This is an atom: 
"Nothin', Fluke, lay down, and if ye hear anyone talkin' keep still. Somebody's coming."

This is an atom: 
"Somebody comes every day," answered Floyd. "That ain't nothin'. What ye doin', Flea?"

This is an atom: 
She was standing at the door with her ear to the keyhole. She heard the servant pass her, heard
the door open, and Lon's voice asking for Mr. Shellington. Then she slid back to Flukey, trembling
from head to foot.

This is an atom: 
"Ye're sick, Dear," said the boy. "Get off this bed, Snatchet! Lay down here by me, Flea and rest."

This is an atom: 
The girl dropped down beside him and closed her eyes with a groan. Floyd placed his thin hand
upon her, and Fledra remained silent, until she was summoned to the drawing-room.

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
"Who wanted me?" Horace asked the question of the mystified servant.

This is an atom: 
"I didn't catch the name, Sir. I didn't understand it. He's a dreadful-looking man."

This is an atom: 
Horace rose, put down his cigar, and walked into the hall.

This is an atom: 
Lon Cronk was waiting with a shabby cap in his hand. He bowed awkwardly to Shellington, and
essayed to speak; but Horace interrupted:

This is an atom: 
"Do you wish to see me?"

This is an atom: 
"Yep," answered Lon, glancing sullenly over the young lawyer. "I've come for my brats."

This is an atom: 
"Your what?"

This is an atom: 
"My kids, Flea and Flukey Cronk."

This is an atom: 
Horace felt something clutch at his heart. Fledra's radiant face rose before his mental vision,
and he swallowed hard, as he thought of her relation to the brutal fellow before him.

This is an atom: 
"Walk in here, please," he said.

This is an atom: 
Then he bade the servant call his sister.

This is an atom: 
Miss Shellington obeyed the summons so quickly that her brother was indicating a chair for
the squatter as she walked in. At sight of the uncouth stranger she glanced about her in dismay.

This is an atom: 
"Ann," said Horace, "this is the father--of--"

This is an atom: 
Ann's expression snapped off his statement. She knew what he would say without his finishing.
She remembered the stories of terrible beatings, and the story of Fledra's fear of a wicked
man who wanted her for his woman. The boy's words came back to her plainly. "And he weren't
goin' to marry her nuther, Mister, and that's the truth." Nevertheless, she stepped forward,
throwing a look from her brother to the squatter.

This is an atom: 
"But he can't have them--of course, he can't have them!"

This is an atom: 
Lon had come with a determination to take the twins peaceably if he could; he would fight if
he had to. He had purposely applied to Shellington in his home, fearing that he might meet
Governor Vandecar in Horace's office. As long as everyone thought the children his, he could
hold to the point that they had to go back with him. He would make no compromise for money
with the protectors of his children; for he had rather have their bodies to torment than be
the richest man in the state. He had not yet avenged that woman dead and gone so many years
back. At thought of her, he rose to his feet and smiled at Ann with twitching lips.

This is an atom: 
"Ye said, Ma'm, that I couldn't have my brats. I say that I will have 'em. I'm goin' to take
'em today. Do ye hear?"

This is an atom: 
"He can't have them, Horace. Oh! you can't say yes to him!"

This is an atom: 
Horace's mind turned back to Fledra, and he mentally blessed the opportunity he had to protect her.

This is an atom: 
"I don't think, Mr. Cronk, that you will take your children," he said, "even granted that they
are yours. I'm not sure of that yet."

This is an atom: 
Lon's brown face yellowed. Had they discovered the secret that he had kept all the dark, revengeful
years?

This is an atom: 
Horace's next words banished that fear: "I shall have to have you identified by one of them
before I should even, consider your statement."

This is an atom: 
Cronk smiled in relief; and Ann shuddered, as she thought of Flukey's frail body in the man's
thick, twisting fingers.

This is an atom: 
"That be easy enough to do. Jest call the gal--or the boy."

This is an atom: 
"The boy is too ill to get up," said Ann huskily; "and I beg of you to go away and leave them
with us. You don't care for them--you know you don't."

This is an atom: 
"Who said as how I don't care for my own brats?"

This is an atom: 
"The little girl told me the night she came here that you hated her, and also that you abused
them."

This is an atom: 
"I'll fix her for that!" muttered Lon.

This is an atom: 
"I don't believe you'll touch her while she is with me," said Horace hotly. "I shall send for
the girl, and, if you are their father, then--"

This is an atom: 
"They can't go!" cried Ann.

This is an atom: 
"I haven't said that they could go, Ann. I was just going to say to Mr. Cronk that if they
wanted to go of course we couldn't keep them. Otherwise, there is a remedy for him." Horace
leaned over toward the squatter and threw out his next words angrily, "There's the law, Mr.
Cronk! Ann, please call Fledra."

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
The girl responded with the weight of the world on her. Had some arrangements been made for
her and Floyd between Horace and Lon? She knew that Ann was there, and that Mr. Shellington
had been talking with the squatter long enough to decide what should be done. She walked slowly
to the door, her head spinning with anxiety and fear. For one single moment she paused on the
threshold, then stepped within.

This is an atom: 
Drop by drop, the color went from her cheeks, leaving them waxen white. She threw the squatter
an unbending opposing glance.

This is an atom: 
"Did you come for Fluke and me, Pappy Lon?" she stammered.

This is an atom: 
Her lips trembled perceptibly; but she went forward, and, taking Ann's hand in hers, stood
facing Cronk.

This is an atom: 
Lon looked her over from head to foot. First, his gaze took in the pretty dark head; then it
traveled slowly downward, until for an instant his fierce eyes rested on her small feet.

This is an atom: 
"Yep," he replied, raising a swift look, "I comed for ye both--you and Flukey, too. Go and
git ready!"

This is an atom: 
Fledra dared not appeal to Horace. He stood so quietly in his place, making no motion to speak,
that she felt positive that he wished her to go away. She was too dazed to count up the sum
of her troubles. Her face fell into a shadow and grew immeasurably sad. Lon was glowering at
her, and she read his decision like an open page. The dreadful opposition in his shaggy brown
eyes spurred Fledra forward; but Ann's arms stole about her waist, and the slender figure was
drawn close. A feeling of thanksgiving rushed over the girl. How glad she was that she had
kept the secret of Everett's unfaithfulness!

This is an atom: 
"Sister Ann," she gasped, "can't ye keep us from him? Fluke nor me don't want to go, and Pappy
Lon don't like us, either. I couldn't go--I'd ruther die, I would! He'd make me go to Lem's
scow! Ye can see I can't go, can't you?" She wheeled around and looked at Horace, her eyes
filled with a frightened appeal. Shellington's glance was compassionate and tender.

This is an atom: 
"I not only see that you can't go," said he; "but I will see to it that you don't go. Mr. Cronk,
I shall have to ask you to leave my house."

This is an atom: 
"I don't go one step," growled Lon, "till I get them kids! Where's Flukey?" He made a move
toward the door; but Horace thrust his big form in front of him.

This is an atom: 
"The boy shall not know that you are here," said he. "I shall keep it from him because he's
ill, and because a great worry like this might seriously harm him. It might even kill him."

This is an atom: 
Lon's temper raced away with his judgment.

This is an atom: 
"What do I care if he dies or not? I'm goin' to have him, dead or alive!"

This is an atom: 
Shellington noted the hatred and menace in the other's tones, and he smiled in triumph.

This is an atom: 
"It's about as I thought, Mr. Cronk. You care no more for these children than if they were
animals. That statement you just made will go against you at the proper time, all right. Please
go now, and remember what I've said, that you have the law. And remember another thing: if
you do fight, I shall bring everything I can find against you, if I have to ask the aid of
Governor Vandecar. I see no other course open to you. Good-day, Sir."

This is an atom: 
Cronk glared about until his gaze rested upon the two girls. His eyes pierced into the soul
of Fledra. She shuddered and drew closer to Miss Shellington. The squatter walked toward the
door, and once more looked back, an evil expression crossing his face and settling in deep
lines about his mouth.

This is an atom: 
"Ye remember what I told ye, Flea, the last time I seed ye! I meant what I said then, and I
say it over again!"

This is an atom: 
The emphasis upon the words struck terror to Fledra's sensibilities. But, with new courage
in her eyes, she advanced a step, and, raising a set face, replied:

This is an atom: 
"Ye can't have us, Pappy Lon--you can't! I'll take care of Flukey, and Mr. Shellington'll take
care--of--me."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

This is an atom: 
Horace set his teeth firmly as he closed the door, upon Cronk. Through the door window he saw
the squatter take his lumbering way down the steps, and noticed that the man paused and looked
back at the house. The heavy face was black with baffled rage, and Lon raised his fist and
shook it threateningly. If Horace had been determined in the first instant that the squatter
should not get possession of the twins, he was now many times more resolute to keep to his
decision. For his life, he could not imagine Lon Cronk the father of his young charges.

This is an atom: 
He returned to the drawing-room, and found Ann and Fledra still together, the girl's face hidden
in Miss Shellington's lap.

This is an atom: 
"Horace," cried Ann, "there can't be any way in which he can take them, can there? He didn't
tell you how he found out they were here, did he?"

This is an atom: 
"No, I forgot to ask him, and it doesn't matter about that. Our only task now will be to keep
them from him. Fledra, when you have finished talking with Ann, will you come to me?"

This is an atom: 
Fledra raised her head. Something in Horace's eyes frightened her. She had never seen him so
pale, nor had his lips ever been so set and white.

This is an atom: 
Ann rose quickly. Of late Horace's actions had aroused her suspicions. She was now fully convinced
that Everett had been right. Moreover, she had come to feel that she would willingly overlook
Fledra's birth, if her brother's intentions were serious.

This is an atom: 
"Go to him now, and trust--have faith that you will not have to go away!"

This is an atom: 
Fledra kissed Ann's hands and tremblingly followed Shellington into his study.

This is an atom: 
She sat down without waiting for an invitation; for her legs seemed too weak to hold her. Her
attitude was attentive, and her poise was graceful. For some minutes Horace arranged the papers
on his desk, while Fledra peeped at him from under her lashes. He looked even sterner than
when he had ordered Lon to leave the house, and his silence terrified her more than if he had
scolded her. At last he turned quickly.

This is an atom: 
"Fledra, I've asked you to come here, because I can't stand our troubles any longer. I believe
in my soul that you love me; for you have told me so, and--and have given me every reason to
hope it. We are facing a new danger, both for you and for Floyd, and I am sure you want to
help me all you can." He paused a moment, and went on, "Your suffering is over as far as your
own people are concerned. There is no law that can force a child as old as you are to return
to such a hateful place, and I shall take it upon myself to see that neither you nor your brother
is forced to leave here."

This is an atom: 
Fledra uttered a cry and half-rose to her feet; but, as Horace continued speaking, she sank down.

This is an atom: 
"I think it probable that we shall have to go to law, for Mr. Cronk looks like a very determined
man; but he'll find that I will fight his claim every inch of the way." Shellington bent toward
her and rested a hand on the papers he had been sorting. "I'm very glad you didn't go to school
today, and you must not go again until it is over. This man may try to kidnap you." He found
it impossible to call Lon her father.

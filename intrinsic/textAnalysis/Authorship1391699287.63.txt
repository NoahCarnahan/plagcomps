JANUARY
                                1659-60

This is an atom: 
[The year did not legally begin in England before the 25th March
     until the act for altering the style fixed the 1st of January as the
     first day of the year, and previous to 1752 the year extended from
     March 25th to the following March 24th.  Thus since 1752 we have
     been in the habit of putting the two dates for the months of January
     and February and March 1 to 24--in all years previous to 1752.
     Practically, however, many persons considered the year to commence
     with January 1st, as it will be seen Pepys did.  The 1st of January
     was considered as New Year's day long before Pepys's time.  The
     fiscal year has not been altered; and the national accounts are
     still reckoned from old Lady Day, which falls on the 6th of April.]

Blessed be God, at the end of the last year I was in very good health, without any sense of
my old pain, but upon taking of cold.

This is an atom: 
[Pepys was successfully cut for the stone on March 26th, 1658.  See
     March 26th below.  Although not suffering from this cause again
     until the end of his life, there are frequent references in the
     Diary to pain whenever he caught cold.  In a letter from Pepys to
     his nephew Jackson, April 8th, 1700, there is a reference to the
     breaking out three years before his death of the wound caused by the
     cutting for the stone: "It has been my calamity for much the
     greatest part of this time to have been kept bedrid, under an evil
     so rarely known as to have had it matter of universal surprise and
     with little less general opinion of its dangerousness; namely, that
     the cicatrice of a wound occasioned upon my cutting for the stone,
     without hearing anything of it in all this time, should after more
     than 40 years' perfect cure, break out again."  At the post-mortem
     examination a nest of seven stones, weighing four and a half ounces,
     was found in the left kidney, which was entirely ulcerated.]

I lived in Axe Yard,

This is an atom: 
[Pepys's house was on the south side of King Street, Westminster;
     it is singular that when he removed to a residence in the city, he
     should have settled close to another Axe Yard.  Fludyer Street
     stands on the site of Axe Yard, which derived its name from a great
     messuage or brewhouse on the west side of King Street, called "The
     Axe," and referred to in a document of the 23rd of Henry VIII--B.]

The condition of the State was thus; viz. the Rump, after being disturbed by my Lord Lambert,

This is an atom: 
[John Lambert, major-general in the Parliamentary army.  The title
     Lord was not his by right, but it was frequently given to the
     republican officers.  He was born in 1619, at Calton Hall, in the
     parish of Kirkby-in-Malham-Dale, in the West Riding of Yorkshire.
     In 1642 he was appointed captain of horse under Fairfax, and acted
     as major-general to Cromwell in 1650 during the war in Scotland.
     After this Parliament conferred on him a grant of lands in Scotland
     worth L1000 per annum.  He refused to take the oath of allegiance to
     Cromwell, for which the Protector deprived him of his commission.
     After Cromwell's death he tried to set up a military government.
     The Commons cashiered Lambert, Desborough, and other officers,
     October 12th, 1659, but Lambert retaliated by thrusting out the
     Commons, and set out to meet Monk.  His men fell away from him, and
     he was sent to the Tower, March 3rd, 1660, but escaped.  In 1662 he
     was tried on a charge of high treason and condemned, but his life
     was spared.  It is generally stated that he passed the remainder of
     his life in the island of Guernsey, but this is proved to be
     incorrect by a MS. in the Plymouth Athenaeum, entitled "Plimmouth
     Memoirs collected by James Yonge, 1684" This will be seen from the
     following extracts quoted by Mr. R. J. King, in "Notes and Queries,"
     "1667 Lambert the arch-rebel brought to this island [St. Nicholas,
     at the entrance of Plymouth harbour]."  "1683 Easter day Lambert
     that olde rebell dyed this winter on Plimmouth Island where he had
     been prisoner 15 years and more."]

This is an atom: 
[Sir John Lawson, the son of a poor man at Hull, entered the navy as
     a common sailor, rose to the rank of admiral, and distinguished
     himself during the Protectorate.  Though a republican, he readily
     closed with the design of restoring the King.  He was vice-admiral
     under the Earl of Sandwich, and commanded the "London" in the
     squadron which conveyed Charles II. to England.  He was mortally
     wounded in the action with the Dutch off Harwich, June, 1665.  He
     must not be confounded with another John Lawson, the Royalist, of
     Brough Hall, in Yorkshire, who was created a Baronet by Charles II,
     July 6th, 1665.]

married Ann Clarges, March, 1654, died January 3rd, 1676.]--is with his army in Scotland. 
Only my Lord Lambert is not yet come into the Parliament, nor is it expected that he will without
being forced to it.  The new Common Council of the City do speak very high; and had sent to
Monk their sword-bearer, to acquaint him with their desires for a free and full Parliament,
which is at present the desires, and the hopes, and expectation of all.  Twenty-two of the

     Guildhall, and there he declared for the members whom the army had
     forced away in year forty-seven and forty-eight, who were known by
     the names of secluded members."--Burnet's Hist. of his Own Time,
     book i.]

My own private condition very handsome, and esteemed rich, but indeed very poor; besides my
goods of my house, and my office, which at present is somewhat uncertain.  Mr. Downing master
of my office.

This is an atom: 
[George Downing was one of the Four Tellers of the Receipt of the
     Exchequer, and in his office Pepys was a clerk.  He was the son of
     Emmanuel Downing of the Inner Temple, afterwards of Salem,
     Massachusetts, and of Lucy, sister of Governor John Winthrop.  He is
     supposed to have been born in August, 1623.  He and his parents went
     to New England in 1638, and he was the second graduate of Harvard
     College.  He returned to England about 1645, and acted as Colonel
     Okey's chaplain before he entered into political life.  Anthony a
     Wood (who incorrectly describes him as the son of Dr. Calybute
     Downing, vicar of Hackney) calls Downing a sider with all times and
     changes: skilled in the common cant, and a preacher occasionally.
     He was sent by Cromwell to Holland in 1657, as resident there.  At
     the Restoration, he espoused the King's cause, and was knighted and
     elected M.P. for Morpeth, in 1661.  Afterwards, becoming
     Secretary to the Treasury and Commissioner of the Customs, he was in
     1663 created a Baronet of East Hatley, in Cambridgeshire, and was
     again sent Ambassador to Holland.  His grandson of the same name,
     who died in 1749, was the founder of Downing College, Cambridge.
     The title became extinct in 1764, upon the decease of Sir John
     Gerrard Downing, the last heir-male of the family.  Sir George
     Downing's character will be found in Lord Clarendon's "Life," vol.
     iii.  p. 4.  Pepys's opinion seems to be somewhat of a mixed kind.
     He died in July, 1684.]

with great skirts, having not lately worn any other, clothes but them.  Went to Mr. Gunning's

This is an atom: 
[Peter Gunning, afterwards Master of St. John's College, Cambridge,
     and successively Bishop of Chichester and Ely.  He had continued to
     read the Liturgy at the chapel at Exeter House when the Parliament
     was most predominant, for which Cromwell often rebuked him.  Evelyn
     relates that on Christmas Day, 1657, the chapel was surrounded with
     soldiers, and the congregation taken prisoners, he and his wife
     being among them.  There are several notices of Dr. Gunning in
     Evelyn's Diary.  When he obtained the mastership of St. John's
     College upon the ejection of Dr. Tuckney, he allowed that
     Nonconformist divine a handsome annuity during his life.  He was a
     great controversialist, and a man of great reading.  Burnet says he
     "was a very honest sincere man, but of no sound judgment, and of no
     prudence in affairs" ("Hist. of his Own.  Time").  He died July 6th,
     1684, aged seventy-one.]

of time God sent his Son, made of a woman," &c.; showing, that, by "made under the law," is
meant his circumcision, which is solemnized this day.  Dined at home in the garret, where my
wife dressed the remains of a turkey, and in the doing of it she burned her hand.  I staid
at home all the afternoon, looking over my accounts; then went with my wife to my father's,
and in going observed the great posts which the City have set up at the Conduit in Fleet-street.

I gave him a shilling for his pains.  Then I went to Mr. Sheply,--[Shepley was a servant of
Admiral Sir Edward Montagu]--who was drawing of sack in the wine cellar to send to other places
as a gift from my Lord, and told me that my Lord had given him order to give me the dozen of
bottles.  Thence I went to the Temple to speak with Mr. Calthropp about the L60 due to my Lord,

This is an atom: 
[Sir Edward Montagu, born 1625, son of Sir Sidney Montagu, by
     Paulina, daughter of John Pepys of Cottenham, married Jemima,
     daughter of John Crew of Stene.  He died in action against the Dutch
     in Southwold Bay, May 28th, 1672.  The title of "My Lord" here
     applied to Montagu before he was created Earl of Sandwich is of the
     same character as that given to General Lambert.]

     Law and Speaker of the House of Commons.  He sat for Brackley in the
     Long Parliament.  Created Baron Crew of Stene, in the county of
     Northampton, at the coronation of Charles II.  He married Jemima,
     daughter and co-heir of Edward Walgrave (or Waldegrave) of Lawford,
     Essex.  His house was in Lincoln's Inn Fields.  He died December
     12th, 1679.]

nothing to do.  Then I walked a great while in Westminster Hall, where I heard that Lambert
was coming up to London; that my Lord Fairfax

This is an atom: 
[Thomas, Lord Fairfax, Generalissimo of the Parliament forces.
     After the Restoration, he retired to his country seat, where he
     lived in private till his death, 1671.  In a volume (autograph) of
     Lord Fairfax's Poems, preserved in the British Museum, 11744, f. 42,
     the following lines occur upon the 30th of January, on which day the
     King was beheaded.  It is believed that they have never been
     printed.

This is an atom: 
"O let that day from time be bloted quitt,
               And beleef of 't in next age be waved,

               But if the powre devine hath ordered this,
               His will's the law, and our must aquiess."

This is an atom: 
These wretched verses have obviously no merit; but they are curious
     as showing that Fairfax, who had refused to act as one of Charles
     I's judges; continued long afterwards to entertain a proper horror
     for that unfortunate monarch's fate.  It has recently been pointed
     out to me, that the lines were not originally composed by Fairfax,
     being only a poor translation of the spirited lines of Statius
     (Sylvarum lib. v.  cap. ii.  l. 88)

These verses were first applied by the President de Thou to the
     massacre of St. Bartholomew, 1572; and in our day, by Mr. Pitt, in
     his memorable speech in the House of Commons, January, 1793, after
     the murder of Louis XVI.--B.]

was in the head of the Irish brigade, but it was not certain what he would declare for.  The
House was to-day upon finishing the act for the Council of State, which they did; and for the
indemnity to the soldiers; and were to sit again thereupon in the afternoon.  Great talk that
many places have declared for a free Parliament; and it is believed that they will be forced
to fill up the House with the old members.  From the Hall I called at home, and so went to
Mr. Crew's (my wife she was to go to her father's), thinking to have dined, but I came too
late, so Mr. Moore and I and another gentleman went out and drank a cup of ale together in
the new market, and there I eat some bread and cheese for my dinner.  After that Mr. Moore
and I went as far as Fleet-street together and parted, he going into the City, I to find Mr.
Calthrop, but failed again of finding him, so returned to Mr. Crew's again, and from thence
went along with Mrs. Jemimah

This is an atom: 
[Mrs. Jemimah, or Mrs. Jem, was Jemima, eldest daughter of Sir
     Edward Montagu.  At this time she and her sister, Mrs. Ann, seem to
     have been living alone with their maids in London, and Pepys's duty
     was to look after them.]

home, and there she taught me how to play at cribbage.  Then I went home, and finding my wife
gone to see Mrs. Hunt, I went to Will's,

This is an atom: 
[Pepys constantly visited "Will's" about this time; but this could
     not be the famous coffee-house in Covent Garden, because he mentions
     visiting there for the first time, February 3rd, 1663-64.  It was
     most probably the house of William Joyce, who kept a place of
     entertainment at Westminster (see Jan. 29th).]

and there sat with Mr. Ashwell talking and singing till nine o'clock, and so home, there, having
not eaten anything but bread and cheese, my wife cut me a slice of brawn which.  I received
from my Lady;--[Jemima, wife of Sir Edward Montagu, daughter of John Crew of Stene, afterwards
Lord Crew.]--which proves as good as ever I had any.  So to bed, and my wife had a very bad
night of it through wind and cold.

to stop her from coming to see me to-day, because of Mrs. Jem's corning, thence I went to the
Temple to speak with Mr. Calthrop, and walked in his chamber an hour, but could not see him,
so went to Westminster, where I found soldiers in my office to receive money, and paid it them.
At noon went home, where Mrs. Jem, her maid, Mr. Sheply, Hawly, and Moore dined with me on
a piece of beef and cabbage, and a collar of brawn.  We then fell to cards till dark, and then
I went home with Mrs. Jem, and meeting Mr. Hawly got him to bear me company to Chancery Lane,
where I spoke with Mr. Calthrop, he told me that Sir James Calthrop was lately dead, but that
he would write to his Lady, that the money may be speedily paid. Thence back to White Hall,
where I understood that the Parliament had passed the act for indemnity to the soldiers and
officers that would come in, in so many days, and that my Lord Lambert should have benefit
of the said act. They had also voted that all vacancies in the House, by the death of any of
the old members, shall be filled up; but those that are living shall not be called in.  Thence
I went home, and there found Mr. Hunt and his wife, and Mr. Hawly, who sat with me till ten
at night at cards, and so broke up and to bed.

4th.  Early came Mr. Vanly--[Mr Vanley appears to have been Pepys's landlord; he is mentioned
again in the Diary on September 20th, 1660.]--to me for his half-year's rent, which I had not
in the house, but took his man to the office and there paid him.  Then I went down into the
Hall and to Will's, where Hawly brought a piece of his Cheshire cheese, and we were merry with
it.  Then into the Hall again, where I met with the Clerk and Quarter Master of my Lord's troop,
and took them to the Swan' and gave them their morning's draft,

they being just come to town.  Mr. Jenkins shewed me two bills of exchange for money to receive
upon my Lord's and my pay.  It snowed hard all this morning, and was very cold, and my nose
was much swelled with cold. Strange the difference of men's talk!  Some say that Lambert must
of necessity yield up; others, that he is very strong, and that the Fifth-monarchy-men [will]
stick to him, if he declares for a free Parliament.  Chillington was sent yesterday to him
with the vote of pardon and indemnity from the Parliament.  From the Hall I came home, where
I found letters from Hinchinbroke

This is an atom: 
[Hinchinbroke was Sir Edward Montagu's seat, from which he
     afterwards took his second title.  Hinchinbroke House, so often
     mentioned in the Diary, stood about half a mile to the westward of
     the town of Huntingdon.  It was erected late in the reign of
     Elizabeth, by Sir Henry Cromwell, on the site of a Benedictine
     nunnery, granted at the Dissolution, with all its appurtenances, to
     his father, Richard Williams, who had assumed the name of Cromwell,
     and whose grandson, Sir Oliver, was the uncle and godfather of the
     Protector.  The knight, who was renowned for, his hospitality, had
     the honour of entertaining King James at Hinchinbroke, but, getting
     into pecuniary difficulties, was obliged to sell his estates, which
     were conveyed, July 28th, 1627, to Sir Sidney Montagu of Barnwell,
     father of the first Earl of Sandwich, in whose descendant they are
     still vested.  On the morning of the 22nd January, 1830, during the
     minority of the seventh Earl, Hinchinbroke was almost entirely
     destroyed by fire, but the pictures and furniture were mostly saved,
     and the house has been rebuilt in the Elizabethan style, and the
     interior greatly improved, under the direction of Edward Blore,
     Esq., R.A.--B.]

and news of Mr. Sheply's going thither the next week.  I dined at home, and from thence went
to Will's to Shaw, who promised me to go along with me to Atkinson's about some money, but
I found him at cards with Spicer and D. Vines, and could not get him along with me.  I was
vext at this, and went and walked in the Hall, where I heard that the Parliament spent this
day in fasting and prayer; and in the afternoon came letters from the North, that brought certain
news that my Lord Lambent his forces were all forsaking him, and that he was left with only
fifty horse, and that he did now declare for the Parliament himself; and that my Lord Fairfax
did also rest satisfied, and had laid down his arms, and that what he had done was only to
secure the country against my Lord Lambert his raising of money, and free quarter.  I went
to Will's again, where I found them still at cards, and Spicer had won 14s. of Shaw and Vines.
Then I spent a little time with G. Vines and Maylard at Vines's at our viols.

This is an atom: 
[It was usual to have a "chest of viols," which consisted of six,
     viz., two trebles, two tenors, and two basses (see note in North's
     "Memoirs of Musick," ed.  Rimbault, p. 70).  The bass viol was also
     called the 'viola da gamba', because it was held between the legs.]

This is an atom: 
So home, and from thence to Mr. Hunt's, and sat with them and Mr. Hawly at cards till ten at
night, and was much made of by them.  Home and so to bed, but much troubled with my nose, which
was much swelled.

This is an atom: 
5th.  I went to my office, where the money was again expected from the Excise office, but none
brought, but was promised to be sent this afternoon.  I dined with Mr. Sheply, at my Lord's
lodgings, upon his turkey-pie.  And so to my office again; where the Excise money was brought,
and some of it told to soldiers till it was dark.  Then I went home, and after writing a letter
to my Lord and told him the news that the Parliament hath this night voted that the members
that were discharged from sitting in the years 1648 and 49, were duly discharged; and that
there should be writs issued presently for the calling of others in their places, and that
Monk and Fairfax were commanded up to town, and that the Prince's lodgings were to be provided
for Monk at Whitehall. Then my wife and I, it being a great frost, went to Mrs. Jem's, in expectation
to eat a sack-posset, but Mr. Edward--[Edward Montage, son of Sir Edward, and afterwards Lord
Hinchinbroke.]--not coming it was put off; and so I left my wife playing at cards with her,
and went myself with my lanthorn to Mr. Fage, to consult concerning my nose, who told me it
was nothing but cold, and after that we did discourse concerning public business; and he told
me it is true the City had not time enough to do much, but they are resolved to shake off the
soldiers; and that unless there be a free Parliament chosen, he did believe there are half
the Common Council will not levy any money by order of this Parliament. From thence I went
to my father's, where I found Mrs. Ramsey and her grandchild, a pretty girl, and staid a while
and talked with them and my mother, and then took my leave, only heard of an invitation to
go to dinner to-morrow to my cosen Thomas Pepys.--[Thomas Pepys, probably the son of Thomas
Pepys of London (born, 1595), brother of Samuel's father, John Pepys.]--I went back to Mrs.
Jem, and took my wife and Mrs. Sheply, and went home.

the soldiers till one o'clock, at which time we made an end, and I went home and took my wife
and went to my cosen, Thomas Pepys, and found them just sat down to dinner, which was very
good; only the venison pasty was palpable beef, which was not handsome. After dinner I took
my leave, leaving my wife with my cozen Stradwick,--[Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Pepys,
Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and wife of Thomas Stradwick.]--and went to Westminster to Mr.
Vines, where George and I fiddled a good while, Dick and his wife (who was lately brought to
bed) and her sister being there, but Mr. Hudson not coming according to his promise, I went
away, and calling at my house on the wench, I took her and the lanthorn with me to my cosen
Stradwick, where, after a good supper, there being there my father, mother, brothers, and sister,
my cosen Scott and his wife, Mr. Drawwater and his wife, and her brother, Mr. Stradwick, we
had a brave cake brought us, and in the choosing, Pall was Queen and Mr. Stradwick was King.
After that my wife and I bid adieu and came home, it being still a great frost.

came after, and I got a dish of steaks and a rabbit for them, while they were playing a game
or two at cards.  In the middle of our dinner a messenger from Mr. Downing came to fetch me
to him, so leaving Mr. Hawly there, I went and was forced to stay till night in expectation
of the French Embassador, who at last came, and I had a great deal of good discourse with one
of his gentlemen concerning the reason of the difference between the zeal of the French and
the Spaniard.  After he was gone I went home, and found my friends still at cards, and after
that I went along with them to Dr. Whores (sending my wife to Mrs. Jem's to a sack-posset),
where I heard some symphony and songs of his own making, performed by Mr. May, Harding, and
Mallard. Afterwards I put my friends into a coach, and went to Mrs. Jem's, where I wrote a
letter to my Lord by the post, and had my part of the posset which was saved for me, and so
we went home, and put in at my Lord's lodgings, where we staid late, eating of part of his
turkey-pie, and reading of Quarles' Emblems. So home and to bed.

the life of Christ, and told us good authority for us to believe that Christ did follow his
father's trade, and was a carpenter till thirty years of age.  From thence to my father's to
dinner, where I found my wife, who was forced to dine there, we not having one coal of fire
in the house, and it being very hard frosty weather.  In the afternoon my father, he going
to a man's to demand some money due to my Aunt Bells my wife and I went to Mr. Mossum's, where
a strange doctor made a very good sermon.  From thence sending my wife to my father's, I went
to Mrs. Turner's, and staid a little while, and then to my father's, where I found Mr. Sheply,
and after supper went home together.  Here I heard of the death of Mr. Palmer, and that he
was to be buried at Westminster tomorrow.

This is an atom: 
9th.  For these two or three days I have been much troubled with thoughts how to get money
to pay them that I have borrowed money of, by reason of my money being in my uncle's hands.
I rose early this morning, and looked over and corrected my brother John's speech, which he
is to make the next apposition,--[Declamations at St. Paul's School, in which there were opponents
and respondents.]--and after that I went towards my office, and in my way met with W. Simons,
Muddiman, and Jack Price, and went with them to Harper's and in many sorts of talk I staid
till two of the clock in the afternoon.  I found Muddiman a good scholar, an arch rogue; and
owns that though he writes new books for the Parliament, yet he did declare that he did it
only to get money; and did talk very basely of many of them.  Among other things, W. Simons
told me how his uncle Scobel was on Saturday last called to the bar, for entering in the journal
of the House, for the year 1653, these words: "This day his Excellence the Lord General Cromwell
dissolved this House;" which words the Parliament voted a forgery, and demanded of him how
they came to be entered.  He answered that they were his own handwriting, and that he did it
by virtue of his office, and the practice of his predecessor; and that the intent of the practice
was to--let posterity know how such and such a Parliament was dissolved, whether by the command
of the King, or by their own neglect, as the last House of Lords was; and that to this end,
he had said and writ that it was dissolved by his Excellence the Lord G[eneral]; and that for
the word dissolved, he never at the time did hear of any other term; and desired pardon if
he would not dare to make a word himself when it was six years after, before they came themselves
to call it an interruption; but they were so little satisfied with this answer, that they did
chuse a committee to report to the House, whether this crime of Mr. Scobell's did come within
the act of indemnity or no. Thence I went with Muddiman to the Coffee-House, and gave 18d.
to be entered of the Club.  Thence into the Hall, where I heard for certain that Monk was coming
to London, and that Bradshaw's 2 lodgings were preparing for him.  Thence to Mrs. Jem's, and
found her in bed, and she was afraid that it would prove the small-pox. Thence back to Westminster
Hall, where I heard how Sir H. Vane--[Sir Harry Vane the younger, an inflexible republican.
He was executed in 1662, on a charge of conspiring the death of Charles I.]--was this day voted
out of the House, and to sit no more there; and that he would retire himself to his house at
Raby, as also all the rest of the nine officers that had their commissions formerly taken away
from them, were commanded to their farthest houses from London during the pleasure of the Parliament.
Here I met with the Quarter Master of my Lord's troop, and his clerk Mr. Jenings, and took
them home, and gave them a bottle of wine, and the remainder of my collar of brawn; and so
good night.  After that came in Mr. Hawly, who told me that I was mist this day at my office,
and that to-morrow I must pay all the money that I have, at which I was put to a great loss
how I should get money to make up my cash, and so went to bed in great trouble.

mathematical instrument maker of his day.  He is frequently mentioned by Pepys.]--and at an
alehouse he showed me the first sphere of wire that ever he made, and indeed it was very pleasant;
thence to Mr. Crew's, and borrowed L10, and so to my office, and was able to pay my money.
Thence into the Hall, and meeting the Quarter Master, Jenings, and Captain Rider, we four went
to a cook's to dinner.  Thence Jenings and I into London (it being through heat of the sun
a great thaw and dirty) to show our bills of return, and coming back drank a pint of wine at
the Star in Cheapside.  So to Westminster, overtaking Captain Okeshott in his silk cloak, whose
sword got hold of many people in walking.  Thence to the Coffee-house, where were a great confluence
of gentlemen; viz.  Mr. Harrington, Poultny, chairman, Gold, Dr, Petty; &c., where admirable
discourse till at night.  Thence with Doling to Mother Lams, who told me how this day Scott

Mr. Crew's, but came too late to dine, and therefore after a game at shittle-cocks--[The game
of battledore and shuttlecock was formerly much played even in tennis courts, and was a very
violent game.]--with Mr. Walgrave and Mr. Edward, I returned to my father, and taking him from
W. Joyce's, who was not abroad himself, we inquired of a porter, and by his direction went
to an alehouse, where after a cup or two we parted.  I went towards London, and in my way went
in to see Crowly, who was now grown a very great loon and very tame. Thence to Mr. Steven's
with a pair of silver snuffers, and bought a pair of shears to cut silver, and so homeward
again.  From home I went to see Mrs. Jem, who was in bed, and now granted to have the small-pox.
Back again, and went to the Coffee-house, but tarried not, and so home.

Moon, where I found the Captain and Mr. Billingsly and Newman, a barber, where we were very
merry, and had the young man that plays so well on the Welsh harp.  Billingsly paid for all.
Thence home, and finding my letters this day not gone by the carrier I new sealed them, but
my brother Tom coming we fell into discourse about my intention to feast the Joyces.  I sent
for a bit of meat for him from the cook's, and forgot to send my letters this night.  So I
went to bed, and in discourse broke to my wife what my thoughts were concerning my design of
getting money by, &c.

told me how high Haselrigge, and Morly, the last night began at my Lord Mayor's to exclaim
against the City of London, saying that they had forfeited their charter.  And how the Chamberlain
of the City did take them down, letting them know how much they were formerly beholding to
the City, &c.  He also told me that Monk's letter that came to them by the sword-bearer was
a cunning piece, and that which they did not much trust to; but they were resolved to make
no more applications to the Parliament, nor to pay any money, unless the secluded members be
brought in, or a free Parliament chosen.  Thence to my office, where nothing to do.  So to
Will's with Mr. Pinkney, who invited me to their feast at his Hall the next Monday.  Thence
I went home and took my wife and dined at Mr. Wades, and after that we went and visited Catan.
From thence home again, and my wife was very unwilling to let me go forth, but with some discontent
would go out if I did, and I going forth towards Whitehall, I saw she followed me, and so I
staid and took her round through Whitehall, and so carried her home angry.  Thence I went to
Mrs. Jem, and found her up and merry, and that it did not prove the small-pox, but only the
swine-pox; so I played a game or two at cards with her.  And so to Mr. Vines, where he and
I and Mr. Hudson played half-a-dozen things, there being there Dick's wife and her sister.
After that I went home and found my wife gone abroad to Mr. Hunt's, and came in a little after
me.--So to bed.

from Westminster Hall with Mr. Moore (with whom I had been in the lobby to hear news, and had
spoke with Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper about my Lord's lodgings) to his house, I met with Captain
Holland, who told me that he hath brought his wife to my house, so I posted home and got a
dish of meat for them.  They staid with me all the afternoon, and went hence in the evening.
Then I went with my wife, and left her at market, and went myself to the Coffee-house, and
heard exceeding good argument against Mr. Harrington's assertion, that overbalance of propriety
[i.e., property] was the foundation of government.  Home, and wrote to Hinchinbroke, and sent
that and my other letter that missed of going on Thursday last.  So to bed.

neighbours that I could not sleep for an hour or two, I slept late, and then in the morning
took physic, and so staid within all day.  At noon my brother John came to me, and I corrected
as well as I could his Greek speech to say the Apposition, though I believe he himself was
as well able to do it as myself.  After that we went to read in the great Officiale about the
blessing of bells in the Church of Rome. After that my wife and I in pleasant discourse till
night, then I went to supper, and after that to make an end of this week's notes in this book,
and so to bed.  It being a cold day and a great snow my physic did not work so well as it should
have done.

to-morrow with Mr. Edward to Twickenham, and likewise did talk to me concerning things of state;
and expressed his mind how just it was that the secluded members should come to sit again.
I went from thence, and in my way went into an alehouse and drank my morning draft with Matthew
Andrews and two or three more of his friends, coachmen.  And of one of them I did hire a coach
to carry us to-morrow to Twickenham. From thence to my office, where nothing to do; but Mr.
Downing he came and found me all alone; and did mention to me his going back into Holland,
and did ask me whether I would go or no, but gave me little encouragement, but bid me consider
of it; and asked me whether I did not think that Mr. Hawly could perform the work of my office
alone or no.  I confess I was at a great loss, all the day after, to bethink myself how to
carry this business.  At noon, Harry Ethall came to me and went along with Mr. Maylard by coach
as far as Salsbury Court, and there we set him down, and we went to the Clerks, where we came
a little too late, but in a closet we had a very good dinner by Mr. Pinkny's courtesy, and
after dinner we had pretty good singing, and one, Hazard, sung alone after the old fashion,
which was very much cried up, but I did not like it.  Thence we went to the Green Dragon, on
Lambeth Hill, both the Mr. Pinkney's, Smith, Harrison, Morrice, that sang the bass, Sheply
and I, and there we sang of all sorts of things, and I ventured with good success upon things
at first sight, and after that I played on my flageolet, and staid there till nine o'clock,
very merry and drawn on with one song after another till it came to be so late.  After that
Sheply, Harrison and myself, we went towards Westminster on foot, and at the Golden Lion, near
Charing Cross, we went in and drank a pint of wine, and so parted, and thence home, where I
found my wife and maid a-washing. I staid up till the bell-man came by with his bell just under
my window as I was writing of this very line, and cried, "Past one of the clock, and a cold,
frosty, windy morning."  I then went to bed, and left my wife and the maid a-washing still.

Hall I met Mr. Woodfine, and took him to Will's and drank with him. Thence the child and I

parted and went homewards, it being market day at Brainford [Brentford].  I set my wife down
and went with the coach to Mr. Crew's, thinking to have spoke with Mr. Moore and Mrs. Jem,
he having told me the reason of his melancholy was some unkindness from her after so great
expressions of love, and how he had spoke to her friends and had their consent, and that he
would desire me to take an occasion of speaking with her, but by no means not to heighten her
discontent or distaste whatever it be, but to make it up if I can. But he being out of doors,
I went away and went to see Mrs. Jem, who was now very well again, and after a game or two
at cards, I left her.  So I went to the Coffee Club, and heard very good discourse; it was
in answer to Mr. Harrington's answer, who said that the state of the Roman government was not
a settled government, and so it was no wonder that the balance of propriety [i.e., property]
was in one hand, and the command in another, it being therefore always in a posture of war;
but it was carried by ballot, that it was a steady government, though it is true by the voices
it had been carried before that it was an unsteady government; so to-morrow it is to be proved
by the opponents that the balance lay in one hand, and the government in another.  Thence I

where a lazy poor sermon.  And so home with Mrs. Turner and sitting with her a while we went
to my father's where we supt very merry, and so home.  This day I began to put on buckles to
my shoes, which I have bought yesterday of Mr. Wotton.

finding Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, I took him to the Axe and gave him his morning draft.  Thence
to my office and there did nothing but make up my balance.  Came home and found my wife dressing
of the girl's head, by which she was made to look very pretty.  I went out and paid Wilkinson
what I did owe him, and brought a piece of beef home for dinner.  Thence I went out and paid
Waters, the vintner, and went to see Mrs. Jem, where I found my Lady Wright, but Scott was
so drunk that he could not be seen.  Here I staid and made up Mrs. Ann's bills, and played
a game or two at cards, and thence to Westminster Hall, it being very dark.  I paid Mrs. Michell,
my bookseller, and back to Whitehall, and in the garden, going through to the Stone Gallery--[The
Stone Gallery was a long passage between the Privy Garden and the river.  It led from the Bowling
Green to the Court of the Palace]--I fell into a ditch, it being very dark.  At the Clerk's
chamber I met with Simons and Luellin, and went with them to Mr. Mount's chamber at the Cock
Pit, where we had some rare pot venison, and ale to abundance till almost twelve at night,
and after a song round we went home.  This day the Parliament sat late, and resolved of the
declaration to be printed for the people's satisfaction, promising them a great many good things.

Ethell and Mr. Stevens, I went and told part of the excise money till twelve o'clock, and then
called on my wife and took her to Mr. Pierces, she in the way being exceedingly troubled with
a pair of new pattens, and I vexed to go so slow, it being late.  There when we came we found
Mrs. Carrick very fine, and one Mr. Lucy, who called one another husband and wife, and after
dinner a great deal of mad stir. There was pulling off Mrs. bride's and Mr. bridegroom's ribbons;

[The scramble for ribbons, here mentioned by Pepys in connection
     with weddings (see also January 26th, 1660-61, and February 8th,
     1662-3), doubtless formed part of the ceremony of undressing the
     bridegroom, which, as the age became more refined, fell into disuse.
     All the old plays are silent on the custom; the earliest notice of
     which occurs in the old ballad of the wedding of Arthur O'Bradley,
     printed in the Appendix to "Robin Hood," 1795, where we read--

                    For the honour of Arthur O'Bradley."

Sir Winston Churchill also observes ("Divi Britannici," p. 340) that
     James I. was no more troubled at his querulous countrymen robbing
     him than a bridegroom at the losing of his points and garters.  Lady
     Fanshawe, in her "Memoirs," says, that at the nuptials of Charles
     II. and the Infanta, "the Bishop of London declared them married in
     the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and then they
     caused the ribbons her Majesty wore to be cut in little pieces; and
     as far as they would go, every one had some."  The practice still
     survives in the form of wedding favours.

A similar custom is still of every day's occurrence at Dieppe.  Upon
     the morrow after their marriage, the bride and bridegroom
     perambulate the streets, followed by a numerous cortege, the guests
     at the wedding festival, two and two; each individual wearing two
     bits of narrow ribbon, about two inches in length, of different
     colours, which are pinned crossways upon the breast.  These morsels
     of ribbons originally formed the garters of the bride and
     bridegroom, which had been divided amidst boisterous mirth among the
     assembled company, the moment the happy pair had been formally
     installed in the bridal bed.--Ex. inf.  Mr. William .Hughes,

with a great deal of fooling among them that I and my wife did not like. Mr. Lucy and several
other gentlemen coming in after dinner, swearing and singing as if they were mad, only he singing
very handsomely.  There came in afterwards Mr. Southerne, clerk to Mr. Blackburne, and with
him Lambert, lieutenant of my Lord's ship, and brought with them the declaration that came
out to-day from the Parliament, wherein they declare for law and gospel, and for tythes; but
I do not find people apt to believe them.  After this taking leave I went to my father's, and
my wife staying there, he and I went to speak with Mr. Crumlum (in the meantime, while it was
five o'clock, he being in the school, we went to my cozen Tom Pepys' shop, the turner in Paul's
Churchyard, and drank with him a pot of ale); he gave my father directions what to do about
getting my brother an exhibition, and spoke very well of my brother.  Thence back with my father
home, where he and I spoke privately in the little room to my sister Pall about stealing of
things as my wife's scissars and my maid's book, at which my father was much troubled.  Hence
home with my wife and so to Whitehall, where I met with Mr. Hunt and Luellin, and drank with
them at Marsh's, and afterwards went up and wrote to my Lord by the post.  This day the Parliament
gave order that the late Committee of Safety should come before them this day se'nnight, and
all their papers, and their model of Government that they had made, to be brought in with them.
So home and talked with my wife about our dinner on Thursday.

make perfect, and likewise gave me his order for L500 to carry to Mr. Frost, which I did and
so to my office, where I did do something about the character till twelve o'clock.  Then home
find found my wife and the maid at my Lord's getting things ready against to-morrow. I went
by water to my Uncle White's' to dinner, where I met my father, where we alone had a fine jole

hung upon it in the middle of the street.  I called at Paul's Churchyard, where I bought Buxtorf's
Hebrew Grammar; and read a declaration of the gentlemen of Northampton which came out this
afternoon.  Thence to my father's, where I staid with my mother a while and then to Mr. Crew's
about a picture to be sent into the country, of Mr. Thomas Crew, to my Lord.  So [to] my Lady
Wright to speak with her, but she was abroad, so Mr. Evans, her butler, had me into his buttery,
and gave me sack and a lesson on his lute, which he played very well.  Thence I went to my
Lord's and got most things ready against tomorrow, as fires and laying the cloth, and my wife
was making of her tarts and larding of her pullets till eleven o'clock.  This evening Mr. Downing
sent for me, and gave me order to go to Mr. Jessop for his papers concerning his dispatch to
Holland which were not ready, only his order for a ship to transport him he gave me.  To my
Lord's again and so home with my wife, tired with this day's work.

This is an atom: 
26th.  To my office for L20 to carry to Mr. Downing, which I did and back again.  Then came
Mr. Frost to pay Mr. Downing his L500, and I went to him for the warrant and brought it Mr.
Frost.  Called for some papers at Whitehall for Mr. Downing, one of which was an Order of the
Council for L1800 per annum, to be paid monthly; and the other two, Orders to the Commissioners
of Customs, to let his goods pass free.  Home from my office to my Lord's lodgings where my
wife had got ready a very fine dinner--viz. a dish of marrow bones; a leg of mutton; a loin
of veal; a dish of fowl, three pullets, and two dozen of larks all in a dish; a great tart,
a neat's tongue, a dish of anchovies; a dish of prawns and cheese.  My company was my father,
my uncle Fenner, his two sons, Mr. Pierce, and all their wives, and my brother Tom.  We were
as merry as I could frame myself to be in the company, W. Joyce talking after the old rate
and drinking hard, vexed his father and mother and wife.  And I did perceive that Mrs. Pierce
her coming so gallant, that it put the two young women quite out of courage.  When it became
dark they all went away but Mr. Pierce, and W. Joyce, and their wives and Tom, and drank a
bottle of wine afterwards, so that Will did heartily vex his father and mother by staying.
At which I and my wife were much pleased.  Then they all went and I fell to writing of two
characters for Mr. Downing, and carried them to him at nine o'clock at night, and he did not
like them but corrected them, so that to-morrow I am to do them anew.  To my Lord's lodging
again and sat by the great log, it being now a very good fire, with my wife, and ate a bit
and so home. The news this day is a letter that speaks absolutely Monk's concurrence with this
Parliament, and nothing else, which yet I hardly believe.  After dinner to-day my father showed
me a letter from my Uncle Robert,  in answer to my last, concerning my money which I would
have out of my Coz. Beck's' hand, wherein Beck desires it four months longer, which I know
not how to spare.

This is an atom: 
27th.  Going to my office I met with Tom Newton, my old comrade, and took him to the Crown
in the Palace, and gave him his morning draft.  And as he always did, did talk very high what
he would do with the Parliament, that he would have what place he would, and that he might
be one of the Clerks to the Council if he would.  Here I staid talking with him till the offices
were all shut, and then I looked in the Hall, and was told by my bookseller, Mrs. Michell,
that Mr. G. Montagu had inquired there for me. So I went to his house, and was forced by him
to dine with him, and had a plenteous brave dinner and the greatest civility that ever I had
from any man.  Thence home and so to Mrs. Jem, and played with her at cards, and coming home
again my wife told me that Mr. Hawly had been there to speak with me, and seemed angry that
I had not been at the office that day, and she told me she was afraid that Mr. Downing may
have a mind to pick some hole in my coat.  So I made haste to him, but found no such thing
from him, but he sent me to Mr. Sherwin's about getting Mr. Squib to come to him tomorrow,
and I carried him an answer.  So home and fell a writing the characters for Mr. Downing, and
about nine at night Mr. Hawly came, and after he was gone I sat up till almost twelve writing,
and--wrote two of them.  In the morning up early and wrote another, my wife lying in bed and
reading to me.

This is an atom: 
28th.  I went to Mr. Downing and carried him three characters, and then to my office and wrote
another, while Mr. Frost staid telling money.  And after I had done it Mr. Hawly came into
the office and I left him and carried it to Mr. Downing, who then told me that he was resolved
to be gone for Holland this morning.  So I to my office again, and dispatch my business there,
and came with Mr. Hawly to Mr. Downing's lodging, and took Mr. Squib from White Hall in a coach
thither with me, and there we waited in his chamber a great while, till he came in; and in
the mean time, sent all his things to the barge that lay at Charing-Cross Stairs. Then came
he in, and took a very civil leave of me, beyond my expectation, for I was afraid that he would
have told me something of removing me from my office; but he did not, but that he would do
me any service that lay in his power. So I went down and sent a porter to my house for my best
fur cap, but he coming too late with it I did not present it to him.  Thence I went to Westminster
Hall, and bound up my cap at Mrs. Michell's, who was much taken with my cap, and endeavoured
to overtake the coach at the Exchange and to give it him there, but I met with one that told
me that he was gone, and so I returned and went to Heaven,

L300 by content. He gave me half a piece and carried me in his coach to St. Clement's, from
whence I went to Mr. Crew's and made even with Mr. Andrews, and took in all my notes and gave
him one for all.  Then to my Lady Wright and gave her my Lord's letter which he bade me give

of the Galatians, about the difference that fell between St. Paul and St. Peter (the feast
day of St. Paul being a day or two ago), whereby he did prove, that, contrary to the doctrine
of the Roman Church, St. Paul did never own any dependance, or that he was inferior to St.
Peter, but that they were equal, only one a particular charge of preaching to the Jews, and
the other to the Gentiles.  Here I met with Mr. Moore, and went home with him to dinner to
Mr. Crew's, where Mr. Spurrier being in town did dine with us.  From thence I went home and
spent the afternoon in casting up my accounts, and do find myself to be worth L40 and more,
which I did not think, but am afraid that I have forgot something.  To my father's to supper,
where I heard by my brother Tom how W. Joyce would the other day have Mr. Pierce and his wife
to the tavern after they were gone from my house, and that he had so little manners as to make
Tom pay his share notwithstanding that he went upon his account, and by my father I understand

3 o'clock and then I taking my L12 10s. 0d. due to me for my last quarter's salary, I went
with them by water to London to the house where Signr. Torriano  used to be and staid there
a while with Mr. Ashwell, Spicer and Ruddier.  Then I went and paid L12 17s. 6d. due from me
to Captn. Dick Matthews according to his direction the last week in a letter.  After that I
came back by water playing on my flageolette and not finding my wife come home again from her
father's I went and sat awhile and played at cards with Mrs. Jam, whose maid had newly got
an ague and was ill thereupon.  So homewards again, having great need to do my business, and
so pretending to meet Mr. Shott the wood monger of Whitehall I went and eased myself at the
Harp and Ball, and thence home where I sat writing till bed-time and so to bed.  There seems

Hence to Will's, where I sat an hour or two with Mr. Godfrey Austin, a scrivener in King Street.
Here I met and afterwards bought the answer to General Monk's letter, which is a very good
one, and I keep it by me.  Thence to Mrs. Jem, where I found her maid in bed in a fit of the
ague, and Mrs. Jem among the people below at work and by and by she came up hot and merry,
as if they had given her wine, at which I was troubled, but said nothing; after a game at cards,
I went home and wrote by the post and coming back called in at Harper's and drank with Mr.
Pulford, servant to Mr. Waterhouse, who tells me, that whereas my Lord Fleetwood should have
answered to the Parliament to-day, he wrote a letter and desired a little more time, he being
a great way out of town. And how that he is quite ashamed of himself, and confesses how he
had deserved this, for his baseness to his brother.  And that he is like to pay part of the

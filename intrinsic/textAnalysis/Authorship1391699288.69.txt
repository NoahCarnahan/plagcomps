CHAPTER I.

This is an atom: 
THE ARRIVAL AT BIG BONANZA.

This is an atom: 
It was just about five o'clock in the afternoon of a cool day in autumn when Young Wild West
and his friends rode into a little mining camp called Big Bonanza, which was situated in the
heart of the range, known as the Silver Bend Mountains, Nevada.

This is an atom: 
It was the first signs of anything like civilization that the party had seen in two days, and
though there were but half a dozen little shanties in it, the sight of it was a welcome one.

This is an atom: 
Young Wild West was beyond a doubt the greatest and best known of the heroes of the Wild West,
and though but a boy in years, he had made a name for himself that many an elder person would
have been proud to own.

This is an atom: 
He had earned the title of the Champion Deadshot of the West by his remarkable skill with the
rifle and revolver, and he was ever ready to defend the title against all comers.

This is an atom: 
Many of his warmest friends called him the Prince of the Saddle, because he was without a peer
at breaking and riding the wildest and most vicious horses of the West.

This is an atom: 
When upon the back of the beautiful sorrel stallion he always rode he made a picture that was
dashing and handsome in the extreme. When on his trips through the wildest parts of the Great
West he invariably was attired in a fancy buckskin hunting suit, and with his sombrero tipped
well back upon his head, he surely showed up as a dashing young hero.

This is an atom: 
The flash in his eye told of his courage and persistence, while his athletic form betokened
his strength and quickness.

This is an atom: 
But of all his qualifications to make up a dashing young Westerner his greatest was his coolness
and fixed purpose to do right, no matter what the cost might be.

This is an atom: 
Few, indeed, are possessed of such sterling qualities, and it is only those who are that make
real heroes.

This is an atom: 
But, as we have already stated, and the majority of our readers know, Young Wild West was a
genuine boy hero of the Wild West, and that is only saying the truth.

This is an atom: 
Being the owner of several gold and silver mines, the young deadshot had an income that was
more than sufficient to permit him to pursue his favorite hobby, which was riding about through
the wildest parts of the states and territories in search of adventure.

This is an atom: 
At the time of which we write there was plenty of excitement and adventure to be found in that
region, and Young Wild West was helping along the advance of civilization, which, by the way,
has not reached all parts of the West yet, speaking in a true sense, and reckoning in law and
order.

This is an atom: 
In company with our boy hero were his two partners, Cheyenne Charlie and Jim Dart, and two
very pretty young girls and a young woman.

This is an atom: 
Cheyenne Charlie was a government scout and one of the best known Indian-fighters of his time.
He was yet a young pan, and though he had been "through the mill," as the saying goes, he was
better satisfied to be led than to lead, and thus it was that he had cast his lot with Wild.

This is an atom: 
The scout was a tall man, straight as an arrow, and his long black hair and mustache, together
with his bronzed face, gave him the appearance of being just what he was--an out-and-out Westerner.

This is an atom: 
Jim Dart was a boy of about the same age as our hero, born and reared in the West, and though
he seldom had much to say, he was full of grit, and always ready to do his share.

This is an atom: 
The two were known as the partners of Young Wild West, and they always dressed in the same
style he did.

This is an atom: 
The two girls of the party were Arietta Murdock, the charming sweetheart of our hero, and Eloise
Gardner, Jim Dart's sweetheart; the young woman was the wife of Cheyenne Charlie, and her name
was Anna.

This is an atom: 
The girls, as they always called them, loved to travel around with our hero and his partners,
and they had learned to look upon the dangers they were constantly coming in contact with rather
lightly.

This is an atom: 
Arietta was the only one of the three who had been born and reared in the West, but Anna and
Eloise had been there long enough to become accustomed to its ways, and they could ride horseback
and shoot with great skill.

This is an atom: 
Two Chinamen, who were riding bronchos and leading pack-horses, were with our friends, and
as they came to a halt in front of a saloon that had a sign across the front declaring it to
be a hotel, one of them hastily dismounted, and before Young Wild West and the rest knew what
he was up to he disappeared around the corner of the shanty.

This is an atom: 
There were three men, besides the man who ran the saloon, in front of the roughly-constructed
building, and they seemed to be cowboys, by their general appearance.

This is an atom: 
All four of the men were regarding the new arrivals with no little interest, and when the Chinaman
slid around the corner of the shanty one of them called out:

This is an atom: 
"One of your heathens is dry, I reckon, strangers. I'll bet he's headin' fur ther back door."

This is an atom: 
"Yer kin bet your life on that!" Cheyenne Charlie answered. "Hop likes his tanglefoot once
in a while, an' he never loses a chance ter git it."

This is an atom: 
"Well, if that's ther case I'd better go in an' wait on ther galoot, then," spoke up the proprietor
of the place. "We ain't used ter seein' gals around here, an' I sorter hate ter leave, too.
But business is business."

This is an atom: 
The man spoke in a way that was not meant to be disrespectful, for what he had said was undoubtedly
the truth. The few inhabitants of Big Bonanza were not in the habit of seeing female visitors.

This is an atom: 
"Well, gentlemen," said Young Wild West, "we have just dropped in here by accident, and I reckon
if there's no objection we'll camp around here somewhere until morning. We are making a trip
across the state, and we are going in a straight line as much as possible. What we happen to
strike makes little difference to us; whether it is a mining camp or a desert. We are used
to all kinds of traveling, and generally go prepared for anything."

This is an atom: 
"Talks like he was someone what sorter knows all about things, eh, boys?" remarked the cowboy
who had called out that the Chinaman was heading for the back door to get into the saloon.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," answered one of his companions, while the other gave a nod.

This is an atom: 
"Looks as neat as a pin, too, don't he?" went on the man, who evidently took it that our hero
was a boy fond of showing off in an expensive costume, and that he did not amount to a great deal.

This is an atom: 
"They all look neat," one of the others observed. "Them gals is sartinly worth lookin' at,
ain't they? They've struck it rich somewhere, an' ther first big town they come ter they've
bought new clothes. I reckon I kin judge things all right."

This is an atom: 
"So you think you can judge pretty well, eh?" said Young Wild West, as he dismounted. "Well,
what do you take me to be?"

This is an atom: 
"A putty smart boy, who thinks it looks nice ter have his hair long, an' who likes ter put
on lugs 'cause he's got some putty gals with him," answered the cowboy, after a slight pause.

This is an atom: 
"So that is your opinion, is it?"

This is an atom: 
"I reckon it is, young feller."

This is an atom: 
"Well, don't you think a person has a right to wear good clothes if he can well afford it?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes. I ain't sayin' nothin' about that. But clothes don't make ther man--or boy, either.
How long have you been West, Sonny?"

This is an atom: 
"How long have you been West?"

This is an atom: 
"About fifteen years, I reckon."

This is an atom: 
"Well, I can beat you by three or four years, then. Anything more you would like to know?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, tell him ter dry up, Luke!" said the first speaker. "What's ther use of talkin' ter ther
young dandy? Him an' ther other boy has hired ther man they've got with 'em ter take 'em around
an' show 'em ther sights; an' they've, got ther man rigged out in buckskin an' fancy trimmin's,
jest ter make 'em all attract attention. I'll bet I'm right on that!"

This is an atom: 
He turned to our hero as he said this and acted as though he was sure he was right.

This is an atom: 
"How much will you bet, you windy galoot?"

This is an atom: 
As Young Wild West said this he drew a roll of bills from his pocket and showed it to the three
cowboys.

This is an atom: 
It was just then that the saloon-keeper appeared in the door, and behind him was the Chinaman
who had sneaked in at the rear door of the shanty.

This is an atom: 
"What's all this talk about, gents?" he asked. "I hear some putty loud talk, so there must
be somethin' goin' on."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, there isn't anything going on yet; but there might be, if the fellows don't get a little
more civil," our hero answered, coolly. "It seems that they are trying to pick a row just because
we have on better clothes than they have. If they are looking for anything like that I reckon
they can get it mighty quick."

This is an atom: 
"Wow!" exclaimed the most talkative of the three cowboys. "Did you hear that, boys? Well, well!
Who would have thought it?"

This is an atom: 
Cheyenne Charlie acted as though he would like to take a hand in the controversy, but he managed
to keep quiet.

This is an atom: 
Jim Dart and the girls were looking on with smiles on their faces, while the Chinaman, looking
out of the doorway, over the shoulder of the keeper of the saloon, actually grinned with delight.

This is an atom: 
They all knew that Young Wild West was quite able to take care of all three of the men if it
became necessary and they also knew that something was likely to happen very soon.

This is an atom: 
The two companions of the talkative cowboy laughed uproariously.

This is an atom: 
They evidently agreed with him that the boy was away off in his remarks.

This is an atom: 
Cheyenne Charlie could keep still no longer.

This is an atom: 
"Jest show ther galoots that yer ain't foolin', Wild," he said. "Shake 'em up it little."

This is an atom: 
"Lat light, Misler Wild!" called out the Chinaman, from the door. "Makee allee samee be polite,
so be."

This is an atom: 
"Shet up, you heathen!" roared the nearest cowboy, and with that he caught the Celestial by
the pig-tail and pulled him out.

This is an atom: 
A kick followed this and the Son of the Flowery Kingdom let out a yell of pain.

This is an atom: 
Biff!

This is an atom: 
Young Wild West darted forward and struck the cowboy a blow on the breast that sent him reeling.

This is an atom: 
"If you insist on it I'll give it to you good and straight," he said, calmly. "How do you like
that?"

This is an atom: 
Biff!

This is an atom: 
This time he landed one on the man's ribs, and down he went in a heap.

This is an atom: 
The other two started to interfere, but out went the boy's left and one of them landed on all
fours in a jiffy.

This is an atom: 
Spat!

This is an atom: 
Our hero's right caught the other on the chin and he went, too.

This is an atom: 
As was to be expected, all three of the cowboys made moves to pull their guns.

This is an atom: 
But Young Wild West got ahead of them.

This is an atom: 
"Let go of those playthings--quick!" he shouted. "I will show you galoots that you have got
to be more civil with us. Get up and say you are sorry for interfering with us."

This is an atom: 
There was something about the manner of the boy that told them that they really had made a
mistake. The revolver was held by a hand that was steady as a rock, and there was no doubt
in their minds but that lead would fly from it if they disobeyed.

This is an atom: 
They let go their revolvers and scrambled to their feet.

This is an atom: 
"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Cheyenne Charlie. "A fine lot of galoots you are! Young Wild West is
only a boy, all right, but I reckon he kin lick a stagecoach load of sich fellers as you are!
Make 'em do ther tenderfoot dance, Wild. Go on--jest fur fun!"

This is an atom: 
"All right, Charlie," was the reply, and the young deadshot fired a shot that hit the ground
near the feet of the spokesman of the trio.

This is an atom: 
"Hold on!" the cowboy shouted. "It's all right, Young Wild West. I know who yer are now. I'll
'pologize. Don't shoot no more!"

This is an atom: 
Crack!

This is an atom: 
Again the boy fired, and then all three, knowing what was wanted of them, began to dance for
all they were worth.

This is an atom: 
Crack--crack!

This is an atom: 
Cheyenne Charlie now took a hand in the game, and, while the girls and Jim Dart laughed merrily,
the three cowboys did the "tenderfoot dance" in fine shape.

This is an atom: 
Both Wild and the scout fired three or four shots apiece, and some of them took chips off the
high heels of the boots the cowboys wore.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon that will be about all," said our hero, as he ejected the shells from his revolver
and then coolly proceeded to reload the chambers. "You galoots will know better the next time.
I don't much like the looks of you, but I want to tell you that if you happen to take a notion
to get square with us for what has happened you'll get the worst of it. I hope you understand
what I say."

This is an atom: 
The rascals--for they were undoubtedly such--did not stop to make a reply, but darted into
the saloon.

This is an atom: 
The Chinaman gave a parting laugh, and then, turning to the other Celestial, observed:

This is an atom: 
"Me havee velly nallow escapee, my blother."

This is an atom: 
"You allee samee velly muchee fool!" was the retort. "You allee timee lookee for um tanglefoot,
so be."

This is an atom: 
"Me havee two velly nicee lillee dlinks, my blother; you no havee."

This is an atom: 
"Me no wantee," was the scornful rejoinder.

This is an atom: 
It was Wing, the cook, who claimed he did not want any whisky.

This is an atom: 
He was just a common, everyday Chinee, who did his work well and slept whenever he had nothing
else to do, providing no one disturbed him.

This is an atom: 
Hop, on the other hand, was one of the very shrewd and cunning ones of his race.

This is an atom: 
Gifted with the art of sleight-of-hand, a lover of gambling and a fondness for playing jokes
on people had made him a great character, indeed.

This is an atom: 
But he was a real fixture to the party that Young Wild West led, and as he had on more than
one occasion been the means of saving the lives of different members of it through his cleverness,
he was thought a great deal of by them all, and many of his shortcomings were overlooked.

This is an atom: 
Having disposed of the cowboys, Young Wild West now asked the keeper of the saloon if he thought
there would be any objections to their pitching a camp somewhere around in the vicinity.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon not," was the reply. "There ain't no one as lives here in Big Bonanza, what would
'ject ter anything like that. They've all heard tell about Young Wild West, I reckon, an' some
of 'em says as how they've seen yer. Yer kin bet that yer will be welcome here! Jest help yourselves
ter any spot yer want."

This is an atom: 
"Thank you. I thought perhaps some one might raise objections--the three cowboys, for instance."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, they're strangers here. I never seen them until this afternoon. They must have come a
putty long ways, fur there ain't a ranch in a hundred miles of here, as I knows of. Go ahead
an' pick out a place ter camp. Ther boys will be here in a few minutes, fur it's about quittin'
time now. I'll tell 'em that Young Wild West, ther champion deadshot, is here, an' you kin
bet that they'll give yer a royal welcome!"

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER II.

This is an atom: 
OUR FRIENDS HEAR ABOUT FORBIDDEN PASS.

This is an atom: 
Young Wild West was not long in picking out a spot to camp upon.

This is an atom: 
It was right near a little, running brook that came tumbling down the steep rocks and wound
its way through the gentle slope upon which was located the cluster of shanties.

This is an atom: 
It was easy to tell that the mining camp had not been in existence very long, for the shanties
were new.

This is an atom: 
As soon as the pack horses were unloaded our friends allowed the two Chinamen to go ahead with
the work of getting the camp in shape, while they took a look around.

This is an atom: 
Almost opposite to the point they had rounded in order to ride into the mining camp was a high
ridge, which was easily a hundred feet above the level. It extended around on both sides and
joined the sloping, irregular side of the mountain over which the trail ran.

This is an atom: 
Almost in the centre of this was a cut that was about thirty feet in width, and it was so regular
in shape that one would almost have taken it to be the work of man.

This is an atom: 
But it was nothing more than one of the passes that are to be found in the mountains, and which
are so handy for travelers to proceed to a given point in a more direct line.

This is an atom: 
Young Wild West noticed that a trail ran through the camp direct to the pass. But it did not
appear as though it was used a great deal, since the wagon-ruts and hoof-prints had become
obliterated in some parts.

This is an atom: 
"I wonder where that trail leads to?" our hero observed, as he tamed to his two partners. "Wherever
it goes, there are not many using it now, it seems."

This is an atom: 
"It leads on up in the wilds of the mountains, by the looks of things," Jim Dart answered.
"It may be that prospectors have gone that way and, not finding anything worth while, have
come back through the pass again."

This is an atom: 
"Sorter looks that way, I reckon," said Cheyenne Charlie. "But, hello! Ther miners is quittin'
work. Now we'll soon see how many of 'em knows us, as ther saloon man said they did."

This is an atom: 
Sure enough, the miners were seen heading for the saloon. They came from different directions,
for it was just six o'clock now, and they had quit work for the day.

This is an atom: 
The claims that were being worked were all within sight of the shanties, the nearest one being
but a couple of hundred yards away from the saloon, which appeared to be the leading place
in the camp.

This is an atom: 
But as the store was very near to it, it might be that some of the men were bound there.

This is an atom: 
Having satisfied themselves that it was a very nice, little mining camp, our friends turned
to and assisted the Chinamen to get things in shape.

This is an atom: 
They did not intend to remain there any longer to get a rest than for a day or two, but they
were always interested when they struck a spot where gold dust was being taken out.

This is an atom: 
No end of good luck had followed them in their search for gold, and Arietta, the charming sweetheart
of the dashing young deadshot, had the lead over them all, as far as making discoveries that
were profitable to them were concerned.

This is an atom: 
But it was nothing more than chance that had brought them to Big Bonanza, and, as was usually
the case, a little excitement had started immediately upon their arrival.

This is an atom: 
But none of our friends minded what had happened.

This is an atom: 
They were so used to meeting "bad men," as many of the miners and cowboys were proud to style
themselves, that there was absolutely nothing new to it.

This is an atom: 
Meanwhile the miners were not long in reaching the saloon, and the store adjacent to it.

This is an atom: 
Then it was only a few minutes before half a dozen were seen approaching the spot where the
two Chinamen had finished putting up the tents that belonged to the camping outfit.

This is an atom: 
"Hello, Young Wild West!" called out a big man, with a short, gray beard on his face. "How
are yer? An' how's everybody with yer?"

This is an atom: 
"First rate," answered Wild, as he shook hands with the miner, but failed to recognize him.
"How are you?"

This is an atom: 
"Me? Oh, I'm fine! I've struck it rich here in ther wilds of Nevady, my boy! I'm ther prospector
what started ther camp. I named her Big Bonanza, an' it sartinly has been a big bonanza fur
me. Beats minin' up in Weston, all right."

This is an atom: 
"Weston, eh?"

This is an atom: 
Then our hero remembered of having seen the man before.

This is an atom: 
The short, gray beard had changed his appearance wonderfully.

This is an atom: 
The miner was John Sedgwick, a former bartender at a hotel in the little town in the Black
Hills that had been named for our hero.

This is an atom: 
"Sedgwick, I didn't know you," he said, smiling at him. "What in the world are you doing with
that gray beard? It makes you look twenty years older."

This is an atom: 
"Well, we ain't got no barber shop here yet, an' I never was much good at shavin' myself, so
I jest let ther beard grow. But what's ther odds? I'll shave up an' spruce up jest as soon
as I've made my pile. Then I'll light out fur home, an' me an' my wife will live on ther fat
of ther land. I've got nigh to a hundred thousand now, an' jest as soon as I git it I'm goin'
ter strike out fur ther East. Hello, Charlie! Hello, Jim!"

This is an atom: 
He now shook hands with our hero's partners, for they had recognized him as an old acquaintance
the moment Wild spoke to him.

This is an atom: 
The girls had seen Sedgwick, too, and they greeted him warmly.

This is an atom: 
"Well," said the miner, "I reckon there ain't many here in Big Bonanza what ain't heard tell
of Young Wild West an' his pards. I've kept ther boys interested in tellin' 'em about ther
wonderful things you've done. Come up an' shake hands with ther whitest boy what ever stuck
his toe in a stirrup, boys!"

This is an atom: 
The last was addressed to the men who had come over with him, and they now pressed forward eagerly.

This is an atom: 
Young Wild West sized them up quickly and made up his mind that they were an honest lot, indeed.

This is an atom: 
He had come in contact with so many rough characters that he had made it a point to read faces
and study character that way.

This is an atom: 
It was seldom that he made a mistake in his estimation of a man, either.

This is an atom: 
The miners seemed very glad to know the dashing young deadshot and his friends, and after they
had talked awhile they, turned to make their way to their shanties, so they might get their
suppers.

This is an atom: 
As our hero followed Sedgwick a little way from the camp his glance happened to turn toward
the mouth of the narrow pass at the other side of the valley.

This is an atom: 
"Where does that trail lend to, John?" he asked, pointing it out.

This is an atom: 
"That?" the miner queried, as he shook his head. "That trail leads ter Silver Bend, which is
another minin' camp a good deal bigger than this here one. It's only ten miles from here by
goin' through that pass. But few as know about ther pass goes that way. They would rather go
around about twenty-five miles, so they don't have ter go through it. They calls it 'Forbidden
Pass,' yer know."

This is an atom: 
"Forbidden Pass, eh?"

This is an atom: 
Young Wild West looked interested.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, that's it."

This is an atom: 
"But what do they call it that for?"

This is an atom: 
"Well, there's a certain gang what belongs ter Silver Bend what runs things their own way,
an' they say that they've organized inter a gang of outlaws ter clean out them what travels
through ther pass. They put up a sign at either end of ther pass, which is only about a mile
an' a half long, ter let any one what kin read know that they're forbid ter go through. If
they do go through they have ter git robbed; that's all. Ter save trouble an' money ther most
of folks would rather go around ther other way, or else keep away from Silver Bend, that's all."

This is an atom: 
"Well, that sounds pretty good, I think, Sedgwick. I reckon I'll have to go through that pass,
just to see what will happen."

This is an atom: 
"I knowed you would say that, Wild. But if I was you I wouldn't bother about it. They're a
bad lot, an' no mistake--ther men what runs things in that pass. They say there's about twenty
of 'em, an' that ther most of 'em is tough cowboys what have been forced ter light out fur
stealin' cattle an' sich like. Though there ain't any doubt that some of 'em lives right in
Silver Bend, no one knows who they are. They're a mighty bad lot, an' since there ain't no
chance of catchin' 'em, on account of ther many caves what's along on either side of ther pass,
they've been doin' business there ever since we opened up ther camp, here, an' a mighty good
business they've done, too."

This is an atom: 
"That seems a little strange," and our hero shook his head. "What sort of people are they over
in Silver Bend?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, about ther same as anywheres else, I s'pose. But I've heard say that it's ther fault of
them what's in charge of affairs over there. It might be that some of 'em is in with ther outlaws
of ther Forbidden Pass."

This is an atom: 
"It might be, that's true. Well, Sedgwick, you can bet that I am going through that pass! I
want to meet this gang of robbers, just to see if they are any different from any other robbers
I've come across. How about it, boys?"

This is an atom: 
Wild turned and looked at Cheyenne Charlie and Jim Dart as he said the last.

This is an atom: 
"Yer kin bet your life we'll go through ther blamed old pass!" the scout answered, while Dart
nodded, as though it was a matter of course.

This is an atom: 
"I knowed it!" exclaimed Sedgwick. "Ther minute I heard you was here I know'd that you'd be
fur goin' through ther Forbidden Pass. It struck me, first off that you'd come here jest fur
that very, purpose."

This is an atom: 
"No," answered our hero, shaking his head. "We never heard of Forbidden Pass. But we are mighty
glad to hear of it now, I reckon. Sedgwick, you know pretty well what we think of gangs of
outlaws, and the like."

This is an atom: 
"I do," was the reply. "If you start after 'em once, you always land 'em too."

This is an atom: 
"Well, we'll start after this gang, then. You can bet that we'll come mighty near landing them,
too!"

This is an atom: 
"I'm sure of that, Wild."

This is an atom: 
"Say!" said our hero, as the miners started again to go. "Didn't you say that the outlaws consist
of cowboys who have been forced to light out from the ranches they worked upon?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, that's what I heard over in Silver Bend."

This is an atom: 
"Well, there are three cowboys over at the saloon now. I've sized them up pretty well, and
it strikes me now that they might belong to that gang. Anyhow, I am sure that they are no good."

This is an atom: 
"I saw them galoots, Wild. I don't know who they are. But they seemed to be mighty respectful.
Hoker, ther saloon keeper, was tryin' ter tell me how you had some fun with 'em an' made 'em
understand that they couldn't do as they pleased. But I was so anxious ter git over here an'
see yer that I didn't pay much attention. I s'pose I'll have a chance ter talk to yer after
supper?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes. We'll take a walk over to the saloon. I'll ask the cowboys about the outlaws of Forbidden
Pass, too."

This is an atom: 
The miners now left and returned to their respective homes.

This is an atom: 
"Well, Wild, I suppose you are very glad to learn all this," said Arietta, as our hero walked
back to where the girls were standing.

This is an atom: 
She, as well as the rest, had heard all that was said, and her face now wore a smile as she
looked at her dashing young lover.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, Et, I am glad to know that there is a place here that is forbidden to travelers. You
know very well that it would only make me more anxious to do a thing if I was told that I must
not do it. I am certainly going through Forbidden Pass!"

This is an atom: 
"Well, I don't blame you, Wild."

This is an atom: 
The girl possessed a spirit of fearlessness, and she was not the one to advise Wild to show
himself afraid of any gang of outlaws.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon we've struck a blamed funny sort of camp, all right," remarked the scout, as he pulled
the ends of his long mustache. "It couldn't have been better if we'd been lookin' up somethin'
that was ter be good an' excitin', could it?"

This is an atom: 
"Hardly," answered Jim.

This is an atom: 
"Well, never mind about it now, boys. I reckon we'll think about the supper. Hurry up, Wing.
Just get a little move on you."

This is an atom: 
"Allee light, Misler Wild," answered the cook, smilingly. "Me havee, um supper leady allee
samee pletty quickee, so be."

This is an atom: 
"Me helpee my blother," spoke up Hop, grinning. "He allee samee velly muchee slow."

This is an atom: 
"Me no slow," retorted Wing; "me allee light."

This is an atom: 
"There!" interposed Wild. "Don't get in a wrangle over it. Hurry the supper along, that's all."

This is an atom: 
The two Celestials said no more, but both worked away as fast as they could.

This is an atom: 
It was not long before the supper was cooked, and then all hands did fall justice to it.

This is an atom: 
"Now, boys," said Wild, as he finished eating, "I reckon a good cigar wouldn't go bad, so we
will go over to the saloon and buy some. The girls will be all right here, since we won't hardly
be out of sight of them. Come on!"

This is an atom: 
The three soon took their departure, and they had scarcely done so when Hop, the clever Chinaman,
sneaked around a clump of trees and took a course that would fetch him around to the rear of
the saloon.

This is an atom: 
It was hard to keep him away from such places, for he loved gambling and practical joking,
not to speak of "tanglefoot," to such a degree that he could not be held back.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER III.

This is an atom: 
THE OUTLAWS OF FORBIDDEN PASS.

This is an atom: 
The three cowboys were just getting ready to leave when Young Wild West and his two partners
reached the saloon.

This is an atom: 
They had loaded up pretty well with "tanglefoot," and they were doing some very loud talking.

This is an atom: 
But when they saw the young deadshot they became suddenly silent.

This is an atom: 
"Hello!" called out Wild, speaking in his cool and easy way. "So you are going back to the
ranch, eh?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes," answered the one he had handled so roughly. "I reckon we've about had our spree, so
we'll go back now."

This is an atom: 
"How far is your ranch from here?" queried Wild, as he stepped up closer to them.

This is an atom: 
"About thirty miles, I reckon," was the reply.

This is an atom: 
"Why, I heard there were no ranches within a hundred miles of here. That's mighty queer."

This is an atom: 
"Whoever told yer that don't know nothin' about this part of ther country, I reckon."

This is an atom: 
"Well, it was the boss of the saloon who told us. Perhaps he isn't much acquainted around here."

This is an atom: 
Neither of them said anything to this, but went on buckling up their saddle-girths.

This is an atom: 
"Which way are you going?" Wild asked, as they were ready to mount their horses.

This is an atom: 
"Right out that way," was the reply, and the speaker pointed toward the pass.

This is an atom: 
"What! You are not afraid of being held up in Forbidden Pass, then?"

This is an atom: 
"No. I reckon that's all rot what's said about that. Some galoots named it Forbidden Pass,
jest fur fun, an' since then there's them what's afraid of their own shadders what's added
enough to it ter make folks think it's dangerous ter go through there. We come that way, an'
I reckon we'll go back that way. I don't believe there's any gang of outlaws hangin' around
there than there is right in this camp."

This is an atom: 
"Well, I am sorry to hear that. I had an idea that we could have a little excitement hunting
out the gang. If there is no gang there we will be disappointed."

This is an atom: 
All three of the cowboys looked at him sharply.

This is an atom: 
It was evident that they did not know just what to make of the boy.

This is an atom: 
They swung themselves on their horses, however, and started to ride off.

This is an atom: 
"Say!" said Wild, calling out loudly to them. "If you happen to run across any outlaws in Forbidden
Pass just tell them that Young Wild West is looking for them. Don't forget that, will you?"

This is an atom: 
One of the cowboys gave a reply that was not quite intelligible, but as there was an oath attached
to it, our hero knew that it was not complimentary to him.

This is an atom: 
He did not stop them, however, and they rode away straight for the narrow pass at the other
side of the pleasant little valley the camp was located in.

This is an atom: 
Not until they saw the three men disappear in the pass did our friends go into the saloon.

This is an atom: 
But let us follow the cowboys and find out something more about them.

This is an atom: 
When our hero had said that they might belong to the outlaws of Forbidden Pass he had hit the
nail right on the head.

This is an atom: 
The fact was that there was a gang of eighteen villains located in the pass, and these three
had been picked by the leader to ride to Big Bonanza for the sole purpose of leading the miners
to believe that there was no longer any danger for travelers to go through that way when they
wanted to go to Silver Bend.

This is an atom: 
During the time the trio was in the saloon they had been talking in this way, and they had
partly made Hoker, the proprietor, believe that there was something in what they said.

This is an atom: 
The man Wild had treated so roughly bore the name of Chuck Snivel, and he was a sort of lieutenant
of the band.

This is an atom: 
The leader of the outlaws was a scheming man of a fair education, who was called Cap Roche.

This is an atom: 
This villain owned a store in Silver Bend and was also the postmaster there.

This is an atom: 
He divided his time with his lawless band and the store, and, being well thought of in the
mining camp, he had all the chance in the world to pursue his villainy and profit greatly from it.

This is an atom: 
As Chuck Snivel and his two companions entered the pass they turned and took one last look
at Young Wild West and his partners.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon there's trouble ahead, fellers," the lieutenant of the outlaw band observed. "That
boy is about ther worst one I ever had tackle me; an' ther others is putty nigh as bad, no
doubt. It sorter strikes me that they're here fur ther purpose of findin' us out. Yer all heard
what ther boy said as we come away, I reckon?"

This is an atom: 
"I sartinly did, fur one," answered the man nearest him.

This is an atom: 
"He said if we happened ter run across any outlaws in Furbidden Pass we should tell 'em that
Young Wild West is lookin' fur 'um," the other added, quickly.

This is an atom: 
"That's jest what he said!" exclaimed Snivel. "Now, then, what does that mean?"

This is an atom: 
"It means that he's after us," said the second, shaking his head and shrugging his shoulders.

This is an atom: 
"It looks that way," the third villain admitted.

This is an atom: 
"Well, yer kin bet your life we'll tell ther outlaws, won't we?"

This is an atom: 
"We sartinly will."

This is an atom: 
"Come on, then! Let's git to ther cave."

This is an atom: 
They set their bronchos at a gallop and moved rapidly through the pass.

This is an atom: 
"I wonder if ther sign was all right?" said one, as they rode along. "I was thinkin' so much
about what that boy said that I never thought ter look."

This is an atom: 
"It was all right," replied Snivel; "I looked at it. Ther sign that Cap Roche made on a barrel-head
is there. Yer kin bet that it'll stay there, too. Young Wild West might take a notion ter knock
it down; but if he does we'll see to it that it's put up ag'in, or another jest like it."

This is an atom: 
When they had covered about a mile they slowed down a little and began to look behind them
very often.

This is an atom: 
The fact was that they were nearing the hidden headquarters of the outlaw band of Forbidden Pass.

This is an atom: 
The pass itself was just about two miles in length, the entrance being less than a quarter
of a mile from the cluster of shanties that made up the mining camp of Big Bonanza.

This is an atom: 
At the other end the regular trail to Silver Bend would be reached, and by taking the cut through
the short pass just about fifteen miles could be saved on a journey to Silver Bend.

This is an atom: 
But, as John Sedgwick had told Young Wild West, the miners no longer took the short cut, since
so many holdups had occurred in the pass.

This is an atom: 
The clever man who captained and ran the gang of villains was now trying to make the traffic
be resumed through the pass, and, as has been said, Chuck Snivel and two others were sent over
to the little mining camp to make the miners believe that there was no longer any danger to
travel that way.

This is an atom: 
There was no doubt but that they had succeeded pretty well, too, since they were now certain
that Young Wild West was coming through that way.

This is an atom: 
The boy had said enough to convince them of that.

This is an atom: 
It was a little more than half way through the pass that time three villains, who had posed
as cowboys at Big Bonanza, came to a halt.

This is an atom: 
They looked cautiously in both directions, and, not seeing a sign of a human being, Chuck Snivel
nodded his head and exclaimed:

This is an atom: 
"I reckon everything's all right, boys. Come ahead!"

This is an atom: 
Then he turned and rode sharply to the left, to what seemed to be a solid wall of rock.

This is an atom: 
Reaching out his hand, he grasped a rope that was hidden beneath some hanging vines.

This is an atom: 
A sharp pull on this and up rolled a curtain, leaving an opening that was large enough for
a horse and rider to pass through.

This is an atom: 
The curtain was made of some flexible material and was painted to imitate the rock that was
on either side and above it.

This is an atom: 
Snivel rode in the opening and his companions followed him.

This is an atom: 
Once inside they all dismounted, and then Snivel walked over to the edge of the entrance and
lifted a log that was lying there to an almost upright position, leaning it against a rock.

This is an atom: 
As he did this the curtain rolled down.

This is an atom: 
It was a rather simple affair, since the rope that was attached to the top of the curtain was
tied to the log, and when the log was made to drop the curtain went up.

This is an atom: 
It would drop just as quickly when released, as there was a weight at the bottom.

This is an atom: 
The part of the cave the three men were now in was hardly any wider than the entrance itself,
but it extended back a short distance and then took a sharp turn to the left.

This is an atom: 
As they led their horses to this point they came upon a natural underground apartment that
was fully fifty feet long and thirty in width.

This is an atom: 
Though irregular in shape, it was surely an ideal place for a band of robbers to hold forth.

This is an atom: 
The natural ceiling was high, and through the face of the cliff light was admitted through
several zig-zag cracks.

This is an atom: 
Fully a dozen men were sitting in the cave on boxes and stools or lying in bunks that were
built along two sides of it, and none of them appeared to be much disturbed by the entrance
of the trio.

This is an atom: 
"Where's Cap?" asked Chuck Snivel, when he had led his horse to a dark part of the cave and
tied it to the long strip of wood that was there for the purpose.

This is an atom: 
"He's over to ther store, I reckon," answered one of them. "How did yer make out in Big Bonanza,
Chuck?"

This is an atom: 
"Putty good, I reckon," was the retort. "Everything would have been all right if we hadn't
met Young Wild West an' his pards there."

This is an atom: 
"Young Wild West an' his pards!" exclaimed one of the robbers, jumping to his feet, excitedly.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, that's what I said. Why, do you know anything about them galoots, Bob?"

This is an atom: 
"Do I? Well, I reckon I do! I had ther chance ter see 'em a couple of times down in Prescott,
Arizona. I belonged ter a gang near there, which got cleaned out by them same three galoots
yer jest spoke of. I got away jest by ther skin of my teeth, an' I was mighty thankful fur
it, yer kin bet! Young Wild West ain't nothin' but a boy, an' neither is one of his pards.
But ther three of 'em makes ther toughest proposition I ever seen. So they're here, are they?
Well, I wish they wasn't, fur it means bad fur us. I'll bet they'll be lookin' fur us afore
many hours!"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes. There ain't no mistake about that part of it. They'll be lookin' fur us. What do
yer s'pose Young Wild West told me as we left Big Bonanza?"

This is an atom: 
"I don't know. What was it?"

This is an atom: 
"He said if we seen any outlaws in Furbidden Pass ter tell 'em that he was lookin' fur 'em."

This is an atom: 
Bob shook his head and showed that he felt very uneasy.

This is an atom: 
"I know how it'll be," he said, half to himself, "We're in fur it now. That boy has got more
lives than a cat, an' when he shoots he kills every time. He's ther luckiest galoot what ever
tried ter do a thing, an' if he has made up his mind ter clean us out yer kin bet he'll do it!"

This is an atom: 
"Pshaw!" spoke up one of the others. "That's all foolishness. Jest because these galoots you're
talkin' about happened ter clean out ther gang you belonged to in Arizony, don't say that they're
goin' ter do anything like that with us. What did I hear yer say--that Young Wild West is only
a boy?"

This is an atom: 
"That's all he is," Bob answered. "But he kin do more than any man I ever seen."

This is an atom: 
"An' there's only three of 'em?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes."

This is an atom: 
"An' there's another boy?"

This is an atom: 
"That's right."

This is an atom: 
"Well, what is ther third galoot?"

This is an atom: 
"He's a man--a big, powerful one, with no mercy when he gits after a crook."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, he's man, eh?' I thought maybe he might be a woman," and the outlaw chuckled.

This is an atom: 
Nearly all of them laughed at this.

This is an atom: 
But it was plain that the villain called Bob was very uneasy over what he had heard.

This is an atom: 
And Chuck Snivel and the two who had accompanied him to Big Bonanza were not in a jolly mood,
either.

This is an atom: 
Their experience with the Champion Deadshot and his partners had been quite enough to make
them understand that they had struck a proposition that was a little different from what they
were in the habit of facing.

This is an atom: 
While they were talking over it a horseman rode into the cave.

This is an atom: 
It was Cap Roche, the leader of the outlaw band.

This is an atom: 
"Now, then, we'll see what Cap says about it," said Bob, his face brightening a little.

This is an atom: 
"He'll soon fix it so Young Wild West won't amount ter much, I reckon," spoke up one of the
men, confidently.

This is an atom: 
The villainous leader was soon among them and listening to the news Chuck Snivel had brought
from Big Bonanza.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER IV.

This is an atom: 
OUR FRIENDS GO TO THE MOUTH OF THE PASS AND READ THE SIGN.

This is an atom: 
When Wild and his partners entered the barroom of the shanty saloon they saw that quite a crowd
had gathered there.

This is an atom: 
Nearly all the miners working the claims that had been staked out in the camp made the saloon
their headquarters evenings.

This is an atom: 
There were but two or three of the thirty miners who did not drink and gamble, and they usually
spent their idle time with the storekeeper, smoking and talking until it was time to retire
for the night.

This is an atom: 
Our hero cast a swift glance around the room and saw Hop standing almost in the centre of the
room, the miners gathered around him, and their faces wearing grins.

This is an atom: 
The clever Chinaman had come in by the back way while our three friends were watching the cowboys
as they rode into Forbidden Pass.

This is an atom: 
The first thing he did was to try and make himself solid with the miners.

This is an atom: 
Though Nevada had plenty of Chinese at the time of which we write, it so happened that there
were none in Big Bonanza until Young Wild West arrived with his two servants.

This is an atom: 
The men all knew what Chinamen were pretty well, and there was a sort of feeling against them
that they were something not to be exactly classed with human beings, so to speak.

This is an atom: 
Hop knew this as well as any of them, and hence his desire to make himself in good standing
with them.

This is an atom: 
The first thing he did on entering, then, was to pull a chunky piece of bamboo from under his
coat and hold it up.

This is an atom: 
It was not more than eight inches in length and looked to be a very common-looking thing.

This is an atom: 
But while the miners were wondering what the "heathen Chinee" was up to, Hop suddenly gave
the piece of bamboo a twist, and the next minute a small, bright-colored parasol was in his hand.

This is an atom: 
This was raised in a jiffy, and then he went parading around the room with it over his head.

This is an atom: 
Only a minute did this continue, however, and then the parasol vanished as quickly as it had
appeared.

This is an atom: 
The Chinaman roiled the piece of bamboo in his hands and that, too, disappeared.

This is an atom: 
Then he stood still in the middle of the room and bowed right and left.

This is an atom: 
"Me allee samee velly smartee Chinee, so be," he observed, blandly. "Me likee Melican mans
velly muchee."

This is an atom: 
The next thing he did was to toss a silver coin to the ceiling and as it came down he caught
it in his mouth and went through the motions of swallowing it.

This is an atom: 
"Me allee samee eatee money, so be," he went on to say, smiling and bowing again.

This is an atom: 
It was just then that our hero and his partners came into the room.

This is an atom: 
"Hello, Wild!" called out Sedgwick, who was one of those present. "Your funny Chinaman has
been doing some stunts fur us."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, he is liable to do almost anything," was the reply. "What is the matter, Hop? Who told
you that you could come over here?"

This is an atom: 
"Allee samee nothing the mattee, Misler Wild," answered Hop, shaking his head and looking serious.
"Nobody say me comee over here; me comee allee samee, so be."

This is an atom: 
There was a laugh at this, and then Hop had succeeded in doing what he had tried for. He had
got the good will of the miners.

This is an atom: 
Having satisfied himself on this point, he stepped up to the bar, and, nodding pleasantly to
Hoker, the boss, he observed:

This is an atom: 
"Me likee chuckee dicee for um dlinks, so be."

This is an atom: 
"You would, eh? Well, I never yet chucked dice with a Chinee; but blamed if I don't do it jest
this once. What's it goin' ter be, fur all hands?"

This is an atom: 
"Lat light; allee samee all hands gittee lillee dlink. If me lose me pay; if you lose you allee
samee givee um dlinks."

This is an atom: 
"Good!"

This is an atom: 
The saloon keeper brought out the dice, and, shaking them in the leather box, rolled them out.

This is an atom: 
"There yer are!" he said, exultantly. "There's fourteen fur yer ter beat. If yer do it you're
a mighty good one."

This is an atom: 
"Allee light," was the reply; "me velly muchee lucky Chinee, so be."

This is an atom: 
Then Hop picked up the little cubes and appeared to be examining them closely.

This is an atom: 
But he was doing something else, too.

This is an atom: 
He had three dice of his own, and when he rattled the box preparatory to making his throw they
were the ones in it.

This is an atom: 
Hop's dice were not straight dice.

This is an atom: 
They had only fives and sixes stamped on them, so no matter how they were rolled less than
fifteen could not come up.

This is an atom: 
Though the dice were not exactly the size of those furnished by Hoker, it would be hard to
tell the difference, unless one made a close examination of them.

This is an atom: 
Hop rolled out the dice and two sixes and a five showed up.

This is an atom: 
"Lat velly goodee thlow, so be," he observed, and then he picked up the dice and dropped the
regular ones in the box.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon it is," answered the saloon keeper. "Come on, boys. It's on me. I lost, but I made
him throw big to beat me."

This is an atom: 
Young Wild West and his partners knew that Hop had all sorts of trick dice, and they could
easily guess that he had played a trick on the man in order to beat him.

This is an atom: 
But since there was no money involved, our hero would not say anything.

This is an atom: 
He did not like Hop to fleece any one honest, though, and as the clever Celestial was always
bent on cheating some one, it often became necessary to make him give back his winnings.

This is an atom: 
Our hero thought he had better let the boss of the place and his patrons know that the Chinaman
was a sharp and trick gambler, so just as Hoker proposed that they throw again, and for five
dollars on the side, he spoke out:

This is an atom: 
"Gentlemen, I advise you not to gamble with Hop Wah. He is a very smart one at the business,
and he will relieve you of all the money you have, if you play with him. Being a sleight-of-hand
performer, he can do things that you could not see. Just go it light on that point. I don't
want to have him get into trouble, and that is what he generally does when he wins a whole
lot of money. There is always some one to accuse him of cheating, whether they catch him or
not, and then there is trouble. Now don't play cards or throw dice with him for money, if you
don't feel like losing your money."

This is an atom: 
"All right, Young Wild West; I'll take your advice," said the boss of the saloon. "I reckon
that you know what you're talkin' about."

This is an atom: 
Hop put on an injured air and went and sat down at a table.

This is an atom: 
It was now getting dark and the lamps were lighted in the saloon.

This is an atom: 
Wild called Sedgwick to him and they got to talking about the cowboys who had left a short
time before.

This is an atom: 
The miner related what he had heard them say about Forbidden Pass, and the young deadshot nodded
in a pleased way.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon that means something," he said. "Business has been pretty bad, I suppose, and the
outlaws are anxious to have travel through the pass resumed. Well, I reckon I'll take a walk
over and see how it looks at this end of the pass, anyhow. Come on, boys!"

This is an atom: 
Charlie and Jim promptly responded to the call, and Sedgwick hastened to declare that he would
go with them, if there were no objections.

This is an atom: 
"Certainly not," our hero assured him. "Come on!"

This is an atom: 
The four left the saloon and walked over to the pass.

This is an atom: 
Though it was now quite dark, they had no trouble in seeing the sign that was posted at the
entrance.

This is an atom: 
It consisted of a barrel-head nailed together, and the words upon it were as follows:

This is an atom: 
"FORBIDDEN PASS!"
    "Travelers must pay toll, or go some other way."
        "Private Road!"

This is an atom: 
Jim Dart struck a match so the inscription could be read, and when they had made it out our
three friends looked at each other and nodded, while the miner waited to hear what would be said.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon that's what I call putty good," said the scout, a smile creeping over his bronzed
face. "'Private Road,' eh? Well, I wonder who is ther owner of it!"

This is an atom: 
"We'll find out all about it, Charlie," said Wild, assuringly. "Just wait till to-morrow morning.
We'll take a ride through the pass, and don't you forget it!"

This is an atom: 
"Well, it might be that yer won't be bothered now, fur it's jest likely that ther outlaws has
quit ther pass an' gone somewhere else," Sedgwick remarked. "If them cowboys is all right,
an' they kin go through without bein' bothered, it are most likely that you fellers kin."

This is an atom: 
"But I don't believe they are all right," our hero answered. "I think that they belong to the
outlaw gang, and that they came over here and talked that way just on purpose to get the people
here to use the pass, instead of going by the roundabout way to Silver Bend."

This is an atom: 
"It looks that way, I'll admit, Wild."

This is an atom: 
"Well, no matter how it is, we'll go through the pass to-morrow, I reckon. And we'll come back,
too, if it takes a whole day to do it."

This is an atom: 
It was just then that the sounds made by a approaching horse came to their ears.

This is an atom: 
"Somebody is coming through now," said the scout, as he listened.

This is an atom: 
"Get behind the rocks here," Wild whispered. "We will watch him as he goes past, and see what
he does, if anything."

This is an atom: 
A few seconds later a horseman came in view.

This is an atom: 
Our friends could distinguish the outlines of both horse and rider, and when they saw the man
halt right at the end of the pass they were not a little interested.

This is an atom: 
The rider turned and looked at the sign, and, nodding when he found that the sign was there
all right, he started on for the little collection of shanties.

This is an atom: 
"That's Cap Roche, ther storekeeper over in Silver Bend," Sedgwick whispered, as he went on.

This is an atom: 
"Is that so?" Wild queried. "Well, I reckon we'll go back to the saloon and find out what kind
of a fellow Cap Roche is."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER V.

This is an atom: 
CAP ROCHE MEETS YOUNG WILD WEST.

This is an atom: 
Chuck Snivel was not long in telling Cap Roche all that had taken place over in Big Bonanza.

This is an atom: 
The face of the leader of the outlaws wore a troubled look as he listened, and when the man
was through he shook his head and said:

This is an atom: 
"I reckon I'll have to go over and have a look at this dangerous boy, boys. I have heard of
him, and I have reason to believe that he is a hard one to beat. Though he is mighty young,
he has spent his time looking for trouble ever since he was big enough to shoot a gun, and
he has had so much luck that I suppose now he thinks that he is invincible."

This is an atom: 
"He's a regular terror, Cap," spoke up Bob. "I know what I'm talkin' about. I've seen him,
an' I've seen what he could do. He's jest as cool as a chunk of ice, an' yer can't no more
scare him than yer kin a mad grizzly. If he's after us you kin bet that he'll git us, unless
he's catched afore he gits a good start on."

This is an atom: 
"Well, I reckon he'll have the hardest time of his life getting us, though," the leader answered.
"But I'll ride over, anyhow and try and find out something. Told you to tell any outlaws you
met that he was after them, eh, Chuck?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes; that's right, Cap."

This is an atom: 
"Well, we'll see about that. I won't be long in findin' out what he's up to. If he gets through
Forbidden Pass without paying toll he's got to be a good one, that's all. His life will probably
be the price demanded for toll, too. I reckon that's what I'll make it."

This is an atom: 
After a few minutes further conversation on the subject the leader of the gang, who was posing
as an honest business man in Silver Bend, left the cave, leading his horse out under the curtain
that was rolled up by one of the men for him.

This is an atom: 
He rode along in the direction of the little mining camp at an easy gait, and in a short time
he reached the end of the pass.

This is an atom: 
He paused long enough to see that the sign he had himself painted was in place, and then he
made for the saloon, never once thinking that there was any one so close by watching his movements.

This is an atom: 
Cap Roche was well known in Big Bonanza, and he was satisfied that no one dreamed that he was
anything else but an honest man.

This is an atom: 
He made up his mind to tell the miners that he had decided to ride through the pass just for
the purpose of finding out if the outlaws were still there.

This is an atom: 
"I'll have no trouble in making them think that it is safe to go through now," he muttered,
as he rode up to the saloon.

This is an atom: 
Dismounting, he entered the shanty and found the biggest part of the population gathered there.

This is an atom: 
"Hello, boys!" he called out, familiarly. "How are you all? I took a notion to ride over to-night
through Forbidden Pass. I did not let the notion get out of my head, and came right away. How
is business, anyway?"

This is an atom: 
Several of the men hastened to shake hands with him, and soon a lively conversation was taking
place.

This is an atom: 
"So yer come through ther pass, eh?" observed Hoker, after there came a lull. "A putty risky
thing ter do, I reckon."

This is an atom: 
"Well, I don't know. You see, I have had the place watched pretty closely the last few days,
and not the least sign of any one has been discovered there. I feel that the outlaws, if there
were any there, have left for some other parts."

This is an atom: 
Just then Cap Roche happened to set eyes on Hop Wah, who was sitting at a table, showing half
a dozen miners some tricks with a pack of cards.

This is an atom: 
"Hello! You've got a heathen here, eh?" he exclaimed. "When did he strike here!"

This is an atom: 
"Late this afternoon, Cap," answered Hoker. "He's a great Chinee, too. He's a sleight-of-hand
feller, an' he kin handle dice an' cards any way he wants ter. A man don't stand no more show
winnin' from him than he does walkin' on air."

This is an atom: 
"Ah! He must be a curious sort of a heathen, then. Did he come here alone?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, no. He come here with Young Wild West. You've heard of him, I reckon?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, I believe I have. A sort of dashing young fellow, who can shoot well, isn't he?"

This is an atom: 
"Well, I should say so! You oughter been here a couple of hours ago an' seen what he done ter
three cowboys! He sartinly did take ther starch out of 'em in no time."

This is an atom: 
"Yes?" and the two-faced man arched his eyebrows and looked surprised. "I should like to get
acquainted with the young fellow. Where is he stopping?"

This is an atom: 
"Right down below here. He carries a campin' outfit with him, an' he's got two young gals an'
a young woman along, as well as his two pards an' this Chinee an' another one. Oh, Young Wild
West is used ter goin' about, an' it don't 'pear ter make any difference ter him an' his friends
whether there's a hotel ter put up at or not. They didn't even ask me if I could accommodate 'em."

This is an atom: 
Hoker shook his head, as though he felt that he had been slighted somewhat.

This is an atom: 
But Cap Roche only smiled.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon they could tell by the size of your shanty that there wasn't much chance of getting
accommodated here," he said. "I don't wonder that they didn't ask you. Why don't you put up
a bigger shanty, like we've got over at the Bend? This place is growing all the time, and the
time will soon be here when you'll have the chance to fill a good-sized building with boarders.
I reckon there's plenty of dust here that hasn't been dug out yet."

This is an atom: 
"There ain't no doubt about that, Cap," spoke up one of the miners. "This is goin' ter be one
of ther best minin' camps in ther middle part of Nevada, an' there ain't no mistake on that.
It's most placer minin' that we've been doin' here, 'cause we ain't got no machinery ter go
down deep in ther ground. But that there's big deposits down under us there ain't no doubt.
I've cleaned up a cool, thousand so fur this week, an' I've got two more days ter make almost
another one. I'm goin' ter send my stuff over to ther Bend Saturday afternoon."

This is an atom: 
"By the long route, I suppose?" and Cap Roche smiled in a peculiar way.

This is an atom: 
"Yes; that's ther way ther wagons goes nowadays."

This is an atom: 
"Well, I'll guarantee that it will be safe to go through the pass, just the same."

This is an atom: 
"How is it that you are able to give such a guarantee as that, stranger?"

This is an atom: 
The voice came from the doorway, and, turning, Cap Roche saw a dashing-looking boy, with a
wealth of chestnut hair hanging over his shoulders, standing there, looking at him.

This is an atom: 
The villain knew who it was without being told.

This is an atom: 
"Young Wild West, I reckon?" he said, coolly. "Come on in; don't stand there. I don't know
just what kind of a guarantee I can give that this man's gold will go safely through the pass,
but it is my opinion that there are no robbers there. That's why I spoke that way."

This is an atom: 
"Oh!"

This is an atom: 
Our hero walked in followed by his partners and John Sedgwick.

This is an atom: 
As the reader may judge, Wild had suspected the man the moment he saw him looking at the sign
at the mouth of the pass.

This is an atom: 
When he heard Sedgwick say he was the storekeeper over in Silver Bend he did not alter his
opinion, either.

This is an atom: 
Determined to find out more about the man, he had walked over to the saloon.

This is an atom: 
Cap Roche was talking when our friends got there, and as his back happened to be toward the
door he did not see them until after the young deadshot spoke.

This is an atom: 
Wild knew that the only way to get anything out of the man would be first to anger him.

This is an atom: 
He had tried to do this, but apparently he had not succeeded.

This is an atom: 
The face of Roche wore, a smile as he came in, and, giving a nod, he said:

This is an atom: 
"I never saw you before, but I knew you right away. I am glad to meet you, Young Wild West."

This is an atom: 
"All right, Cap Roche. I am glad to meet you, too."

This is an atom: 
"Ah! You know me, then?"

This is an atom: 
"Well, Sedgwick told me who you were. We saw you looking at the sign over at the pass. Quite
a sign, isn't it?"

This is an atom: 
"You saw me looking at it?" queried the man, showing just the least bit of uneasiness.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, we were over there when you came out. The man who painted the letters on the barrel-head
is quite an artist, and he knows how to spell, all right. They say there is another sign at
the other end of the pass."

This is an atom: 
"Yes, there's one just like it there," replied Roche. "I can't help looking at them every time
I come through Forbidden Pass. To-night is the first time I have been through in a week or
two, so I could not help looking to see if the signs were still in place. As you heard me say
before you came in here, I am satisfied that there are no longer any outlaws hanging about
the pass. I reckon they must have got disgusted with the lack of business and moved away."

This is an atom: 
"Maybe they did. But if they haven't moved away they will move before many hours, and you can
bet all you're worth on that!"

This is an atom: 
"You are going after them, then?"

This is an atom: 
"Well, such work just suits me, and whenever we think we can do a community a good turn we
always go ahead and do it. Outlaws don't like me, and I don't like outlaws. It is the same
with my partners. Some might call us a little meddlesome sometimes, but it is a way we have
got, and we simply can't help it. Are you going back through the pass to-night, Mr. Roche?"

This is an atom: 
"Why, yes. It is only ten miles from here to my store over in Silver Bend. That is no distance
to make, you know."

This is an atom: 
"That's right. Well, if you happen to meet any of the outlaws while going through just tell
them that we will be looking for them to-morrow."

This is an atom: 
A peculiar smile flitted across the features of Roche, but he quickly changed it and laughed
lightly.

This is an atom: 
"All right, Young Wild West," he said. "If I happen to meet any of them I'll surely tell them
what you say."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VI.

This is an atom: 
CAP ROCHE FALLS A VICTIM TO HOP.

This is an atom: 
Cap Roche now turned his attention to the table at which Hop was sitting.

This is an atom: 
"So the heathen is showing you something with the cards, eh, boys?" he said, smilingly.

This is an atom: 
"That's right, Cap," answered one of them. "An' he's mighty slick, too."

This is an atom: 
"He is, eh? Well, I'd like to see what he can do."

This is an atom: 
"Me showee velly nicee lillee tlick," spoke up Hop, nodding pleasantly.

This is an atom: 
The Chinaman was quite sure that Young Wild West suspected that the man was not altogether
right, for he was a keen observer and an attentive listener.

This is an atom: 
That made him decide to make a victim of him, if he could.

This is an atom: 
Hop had thought out a brand new trick with a deck of cards, and he was all fixed to work it
on somebody.

This is an atom: 
He was pleased to find that he had a victim.

This is an atom: 
Shuffling the pack well, he spread them out like a fan and held the cards so that some of the
faces could be seen by Roche.

This is an atom: 
"You see um jack of hearts?" he asked.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," was the reply.

This is an atom: 
"Allee light; you allee samee lemember um jack of hearts."

This is an atom: 
Then he gave the cards another shuffle, and in doing it one of them slipped up his sleeve unobserved
by any one.

This is an atom: 
There was really nothing wonderful about this, since there was a thin piece of elastic attached
to the card, and the moment it was released it left the pack.

This is an atom: 
As might be supposed, it was the jack of hearts.

This is an atom: 
But Hop had another jack of hearts, as he needed it to carry out the trick.

This is an atom: 
He kept this one concealed in his hand and passed the deck to Roche, saying:

This is an atom: 
"You pickee outee um jack of hearts and me allee samee showee how me makee fly away."

This is an atom: 
The man quickly looked over the cards and found that the jack of hearts was not among them.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon you took it when no one was looking," he said, with a smile. "That is not much of
a trick; I could do that myself."

This is an atom: 
"Me no takee," declared the Celestial, putting on a look of surprise. "Maybe allee samee dlop
on um floor."

This is an atom: 
He got up from his chair, and then, dropping upon his hands and knees, began looking around
on the floor under the table.

This is an atom: 
While doing this he cleverly slipped the card he had in his hand into the boot-top of Roche.

This is an atom: 
Then, before he got up, he pulled the card that had the elastic attached to it from his sleeve
and held it so the elastic was concealed.

This is an atom: 
"Here um card," he said, as he showed it to every one. "Me puttee in um pack, so be."

This is an atom: 
Roche was watching him closely, for he knew that the Chinaman was up to something, and he was
certain that the card went into the pack.

This is an atom: 
But it did not.

This is an atom: 
It slipped up Hop sleeve the same as it had done the first time.

This is an atom: 
"Now you findee um jack of hearts," he said, smilingly.

This is an atom: 
Roche nodded and proceeded to look for it.

This is an atom: 
"It isn't here," he said, looking surprised.

This is an atom: 
"You wantee tly foolee poor Chinee," Hop declared, putting on an injured look. "You takee um
card and puttee in your boot, so be."

This is an atom: 
"What's that?" cried Roche, half angrily. "Do you mean to say that I stole the card from the pack?"

This is an atom: 
"Me allee samee bettee ten dollee you gottee um card somewhere, so be!" was the quick retort.

This is an atom: 
"You will, eh? All right. I'm a betting man, I am. It don't make any difference who I bet with,
either. I'll bet you ten dollars that I haven't got the card on me. If one has got it you're
the one, for you are doing the trick."

This is an atom: 
Hop held up both hands and threw open his coat, to show that he did not have it.

This is an atom: 
Then he laid ten dollars on the table.

This is an atom: 
"Boys," said Roche, looking at those around him, "I don't know just what kind of a game I am
up against; but I do know that I haven't got that card anywhere on my person. I feel so sure
of it that I'll bet a hundred dollars instead of ten!"

This is an atom: 
"Allee light."

This is an atom: 
As quick as a wink Hop's hand went into his pocket and out came a roll of bills.

This is an atom: 
He quickly counted out ninety dollars more and put it on the table.

This is an atom: 
Roche immediately covered it, and then, rising to his feet, he moved away from the table and
called out:

This is an atom: 
"Hoker, come here and search me. If you find the jack of hearts anywhere on me the Chinaman
wins. If you don't find it I win."

This is an atom: 
"Lat light," said Hop, nodding to the boss of the place.

This is an atom: 
Hoker came forward and proceeded to go through the man's pockets.

This is an atom: 
He did not find the card in any of the pockets, so he went on down and tried the boot-tops.

This is an atom: 
Then it was that he pulled out a card from one of them.

This is an atom: 
"Here she is, Cap!" he exclaimed, as he arose and held out the card so all could see it. "Here's
ther jack of hearts!"

This is an atom: 
"Tricked, by thunder!" exclaimed Roche, as Hop smiled and put the money in his pocket.

This is an atom: 
"Mighty clever, I should say," ventured Sedgwick. "Cap, yer shouldn't have bet."

This is an atom: 
"I couldn't help it," was the reply. "But I know how it was done. He put the card in my bootleg
when he was looking around under the table."

This is an atom: 
"No; that couldn't be," declared the saloon keeper. "He put ther card in ther pack after that.
An' I'll swear that he wasn't near enough ter put it on you after that, even if he had it in
his hand."

This is an atom: 
"Well, that is true, come to think of it. But he got it there, somehow."

This is an atom: 
Roche took the card and looked it over.

This is an atom: 
Then he picked up the pack and compared the backs of the cards with the one he held in his hand.

This is an atom: 
"I lose the hundred, that's all," he exclaimed. "But I'll bet another hundred he can't work
that trick again!"

This is an atom: 
Hop smiled.

This is an atom: 
"You allee samee watched too muchee," he said.

This is an atom: 
"You bet I would watch."

This is an atom: 
The cards were laid on the table by him, and Hop picked them up in an offhanded way.

This is an atom: 
"Here um nicee lillee tlick," he said, as he ran the cards up his arm in a long string. "Evelybody
no do lat, so be."

This is an atom: 
Then he let them go back again, and in doing so two or three of them dropped to the floor.

This is an atom: 
Hop was on his knees gathering them up in a twinkling.

This is an atom: 
Then it was that he slipped a card in the bootleg of Roche again.

This is an atom: 
But he was not caught doing it, however.

This is an atom: 
He got the cards that had dropped and did the trick over again, this time not losing any of
them when they ran back to his hand.

This is an atom: 
Then he suddenly showed the jack of hearts again.

This is an atom: 
"Do you want to try the other trick again?" the man front Silver Bend asked.

This is an atom: 
"You no givee poor Chinee um showee to play um tlick, so be," answered Hop.

This is an atom: 
"What kind of a show do you want? There you are with the jack of hearts in your hand. Now I'll
bet you that you can't get it into my bootleg again!"

This is an atom: 
He moved back from the table, so he would be entirely clear from the Chinaman, as he said this.

This is an atom: 
Hop let all hands have a look at the jack of hearts, and then he allowed it to flip up his sleeve.

This is an atom: 
He shuffled the pack, laid it on the table and brought his fist down upon it with considerable
force.

This is an atom: 
"Lere um go!" he exclaimed. "Me bettee you hundled dollee you gottee um jack of hearts in you
bootleg, so be!"

This is an atom: 
"What!" cried Roche, as he looked down at his feet. "Do you mean that, you heathen?"

This is an atom: 
"Me allee samee meanee," was the reply. "Me wantee givee you chancee to gittee square, so be."

This is an atom: 
The villain had a hundred dollars out in a hurry.

This is an atom: 
"There you are!" he exclaimed. "Cover that!"

This is an atom: 
"Me covee allee samee pletty quickee, so be."

This is an atom: 
Hop did cover it, too; and then, folding his arms, he looked at Roche and remained silent for
a moment.

This is an atom: 
"Search me, somebody," said the latter, looking around. "Here, Sam! He bet that the jack of
hearts was in my bootleg again. You look and see."

This is an atom: 
"All right, Cap," answered the miner.

This is an atom: 
The leader of the outlaws stretched out his limbs and gave the man a good chance to make the
search before the eyes of the lookers-on.

This is an atom: 
He found the card the first thing, and, with a look of amazement on his face, he held it up.

This is an atom: 
"There she is, Cap!" he exclaimed, with a shake of his head. "I didn't think it was there;
I thought ther Chinee was jest goin' ter let yer git your money back. But there's ther jack
of hearts, an' it sartinly was in your boot!"

This is an atom: 
"Well, by ginger!" cried Roche. "I reckon I'm done with this kind of a game. The heathen Chinee
is altogether too much for me."

This is an atom: 
"Young Wild West told us he could beat anything there was goin'," spoke up John Sedgwick. "He's
a sleight-of-hand Chinee, that's what he is."

This is an atom: 
"Well, I am not a squealer, as you all know," said Roche. "But I do think that some one should
have told me that I was betting against a sleight-of-hand performer."

This is an atom: 
"That wasn't fur us ter do, Cap," replied Sedgwick, shaking his head. "You knowed that he was
clever when yer seen him foolin' with ther cards, an' doin' them other tricks. You lost your
money jest because you thought you was smarter than he was. I happen ter know that a man does
a very foolish thing when he bets ag'in a man showin' a trick. That's what ther feller doin'
it wants, an' he wins every time, too."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VII.

This is an atom: 
WILD MAKES AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.

This is an atom: 
Cap Roche nodded his head at what Sedgwick said.

This is an atom: 
"All right," he said. "I reckon I'm satisfied. I am not broke, just because I lost a couple
of hundred dollars."

This is an atom: 
After that he made himself very agreeable to all hands, and when he got ready to ride back
to the cave in the pass he bade them good night and invited them to call at his store when
in Silver Bend.

This is an atom: 
Young Wild West and his partners waited until the man rode off, and then they hurriedly left
the shanty saloon.

This is an atom: 
Wild set out on a run for the camp.

This is an atom: 
He had made up his mind all at once to follow Cap Roche through Forbidden Pass.

This is an atom: 
He got his horse in a jiffy, and, hastily telling the girls where he was going rode off toward
the pass.

This is an atom: 
So quickly had the young deadshot acted that Roche had not more than three or four minutes
the start of him.

This is an atom: 
If he went along at an easy gait Wild would be able to overtake him before he got through the pass.

This is an atom: 
So quickly had the young deadshot acted that Roche had not more than three or four minutes
the start of him.

This is an atom: 
If he went along at an easy gait Wild would be able to overtake him before he got through the pass.

This is an atom: 
Our hero knew that he was undertaking a risky thing, for he was quite sure that there was a
band of outlaws located somewhere in the pass, or very near to it.

This is an atom: 
But he went on without any hesitation, prepared for anything that might turn up.

This is an atom: 
The place was totally strange to him, but the boy had confidence in the sorrel stallion he rode.

This is an atom: 
Spitfire would surely follow the horse that was ahead.

This is an atom: 
There was no mistake about that.

This is an atom: 
On went the dashing young deadshot, covering the ground rapidly.

This is an atom: 
He figured it that the storekeeper of Silver Bend was not going very fast, however, and when
he thought he ought to be pretty close to him he brought his horse to a sudden halt and listened.

This is an atom: 
Wild had reckoned rightly, for he could hear the clatter of hoofs ahead.

This is an atom: 
"Ah!" he exclaimed, under his breath. "That was a pretty good guess. Another minute and I would
have been right up chose to him--close enough for him to see me, perhaps. But I hardly think
he has heard me, so I'll keep right on."

This is an atom: 
He set out again, keeping his horse at a walk.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly the hoofbeats ahead ceased.

This is an atom: 
Wild let the horse walk right on, for the sounds that came from Spitfire's hoofs could hardly
be heard, the ground being very soft just there.

This is an atom: 
But when about a hundred feet had been covered Wild brought his horse to a halt and dismounted.

This is an atom: 
Throwing the bridle rein over the animals head, he hurried forward on foot.

This is an atom: 
He rounded a turn in the pass just in time to distinguish the outlines of a horse, and rider
making straight for the almost perpendicular wall at the left of the pass.

This is an atom: 
Then, all of a sudden, both man and horse disappeared!

This is an atom: 
"By jove!" exclaimed our hero, under his breath. "I reckon Cap Roche has made a stop before
going over to Silver Bend. Now it is for me to find out where he has stopped. I didn't think
I would have as much luck as this. Whew! I reckon it won't take us long to settle accounts
with the outlaws of Forbidden Pass."

This is an atom: 
Stepping forward noiselessly, he was soon at the very spot where he had last seen the horse
and rider.

This is an atom: 
There was nothing there now and only the bleak walls of stone were before him.

This is an atom: 
It was very dark in the pass too, but he could see the stars twinkling overhead, and he was
thus enabled to distinguish objects.

This is an atom: 
Wild went straight to the face of the cliff.

This is an atom: 
He put out his hand.

This is an atom: 
It was not rock that he touched, but a piece of canvas or similar material.

This is an atom: 
This was nothing new to the dashing young deadshot, for he had been up against all kinds of
devices, and, he simply gave a low chuckle of satisfaction.

This is an atom: 
"I'm mighty glad I followed you, Mr. Cap Roche," he thought. "Now, I reckon it will be easy
to settle the business. I'll just mark this spot, and then ride back to the camp."

This is an atom: 
It was an easy thing to mark the spot, for he did it by rolling three stones together, which
he had no trouble in finding with his feet.

This is an atom: 
He took care that they were not directly in front of the hidden opening, so they could not
be knocked aside by horses, should they come out.

This is an atom: 
But Wild knew just where he put them, anyhow, and then he went back to the waiting sorrel,
and, mounting, rode off at a walk.

This is an atom: 
Not until he was a hundred yards from where he had mounted his horse did he set out at a gallop,
and then he was not long in reaching the end of the pass.

This is an atom: 
Wild rode to the little camp and dismounted, surprising his waiting friends for getting back
so soon.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon yer couldn't catch up to ther galoot, eh, Wild?" remarked Cheyenne Charlie.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, I caught up with him, all right," was the reply. "Things worked just the way I wanted
them to."

This is an atom: 
"Is that so? Good enough!"

This is an atom: 
"Yes. I caught up to Cap Roche, and I was just in time to see him disappear."

This is an atom: 
"Disappear?" echoed Arietta. "Then he fooled you, after all?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, no. He didn't fool me, Et, for I found where he went."

This is an atom: 
"Git out!" exclaimed the scout, jubilantly.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, I was right there in the proper time. But I'll tell you all about it."

This is an atom: 
This the young deadshot did, and when he had done the faces of his partners and the girls wore
smiles of delight and satisfaction.

This is an atom: 
Even the girls were always anxious to see him make a success of hunting down outlaws and bad
men, no matter how much the danger was in doing it.

This is an atom: 
They had become so used to it that they thought that Wild and his partners were simply following
the natural law in doing such things.

This is an atom: 
"I am glad you did not go into the place, Wild," Arietta said. "If you had done so you might
have been caught, and then we would not have known where to look for you."

This is an atom: 
"That is just why I didn't take the risk of doing it, Et," was the reply. "To-morrow will be
time enough to get inside the cave, or whatever it may be. But you can bet that both Charlie
and Jim will know just where it is before I make the attempt."

This is an atom: 
Our friends usually retired quite early nights, and as they were pretty well tired out from
an all-day ride, they decided to get the sleep they needed.

This is an atom: 
Hop had not returned yet, but Wild thought he would allow him to stay out, since there was
nothing to do in the morning.

This is an atom: 
He felt that the Chinaman would not get in any trouble at the saloon, since the miners all
seemed to like him.

This is an atom: 
It was after midnight when Hop returned to the camp, and when he came he sneaked in quietly.

This is an atom: 
But Cheyenne Charlie was awake, and he let him know that he heard him.

This is an atom: 
"You yaller galoot, you've been fillin' up with tanglefoot ag'in!" he exclaimed in a whisper.
"Don't think I don't know."

This is an atom: 
"Allee light, Misler Charlie," was the Chinaman's reply; "me feel allee samee velly goodee.
Whattee you care?"

This is an atom: 
The scout let it go at this, and soon the camp was wrapped in silence.

This is an atom: 
Early the next morning they were up and stirring, however.

This is an atom: 
Hop was still sound asleep, however, and when his brother tried to arouse him it did no good.

This is an atom: 
It was not until our friends had eaten their breakfast that it occurred to them that it was
time for Hop to get up.

This is an atom: 
Charlie undertook the task of rousing him.

This is an atom: 
He threw a pail of water on him, and, as might be supposed, it had the desired effect.

This is an atom: 
"Lat allee light, Misler Charlie," said the Celestial, as he made for the brook, after crawling
out of the tent; "me allee samee git tee square, so be!"

This is an atom: 
"You're square now, if I know anything about it," was the retort. "You don't count ther tricks
you're played on me, I s'pose? Now, you'd better look out what yer do ter me, 'cause I won't
stand it, if yer rub somethin' good an' hard on me."

This is an atom: 
"Allee light, Misler Charlie," was all Hop said just then.

This is an atom: 
The breakfast being over, Young Wild West decided to take a ride through the pass, and thus
keep his promise.

This is an atom: 
"Come, boys," said he, "I reckon we'll start out now. We'll go right on through, unless it
happens that we are stopped by the outlaws. When we come back I'll show you the place where
Cap Roche disappeared last night."

This is an atom: 
"I would like to go along, Wild," spoke up Arietta, "Why can't we all go?"

This is an atom: 
"Well, it might make it a little bad in case the villains took a notion to hold us up," was
the reply. "But if you want to go real bad I suppose you may."

This is an atom: 
"We do want to go real bad, don't we, girls?" said Arietta, as she turned to Anna and Eloise.

This is an atom: 
"Of course, we do!" was the quick reply.

This is an atom: 
"All right, then. Hop and Wing will stay in charge of the camp. Get yourselves ready, and be
sure that you take your rifles with you. If we are attacked by a masked gang about half way
through the pass I won't be much surprised."

This is an atom: 
The horses were soon saddled, and then, after giving the two Chinamen instructions to keep
a watch on the camp, and not to get into mischief, Wild led the way for Forbidden Pass.

This is an atom: 
"We are going through, and we won't pay any toll, either!" he said.

This is an atom: 
"If there is any toll to pay, I'll pay it!" exclaimed Arietta, as she touched the butt of her
revolver.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VIII.

This is an atom: 
CAPTURED IN THE PASS.

This is an atom: 
As our friends neared the commencement of Forbidden Pass they saw that a crowd of the miners
of the camp were watching them.

This is an atom: 
A man, whom they easily recognized as Sedgwick, waved his hand to them, and they answered it.

This is an atom: 
"I suppose he thinks that something will surely happen to us, if the outlaws are still hanging
around here," our hero observed. "Well, he may be right; we can't tell."

This is an atom: 
"I want to read that sign, Wild," spoke up Arietta, as she brought her horse to a halt. "Well,
it was not painted by an ignorant man, anyhow. It is about the first sign, with so many letters
to it, that I have seen spelled correctly--in a little camp, like this, anyhow."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, I reckon Cap Roche made the sign, all right, Et," replied our hero. "He seems to be a
pretty smart man. The lettering is good, I must say. And there is even a painted background--something
I did not notice last night, boys. A pale-blue background, with white letters. Well, that is
all right!"

This is an atom: 
"We have got to pay toll, I suppose, Arietta," said Jim, with a twinkle in his eye.

This is an atom: 
"I said a minute or two ago that I would pay it, if any was demanded," she retorted. "Just
leave that part to me."

This is an atom: 
No one knew exactly what she meant, and it is hardly likely that she did herself. But there
was one thing evident, and that was that she did not mean that any money was to be handed over
to the outlaws, should it be demanded.

This is an atom: 
They did not remain at a halt long, but proceeded on their way, their horses at a gentle canter.

This is an atom: 
"Just keep your eyes on the watch for three stones lying close together," said Wild, as they
got nearly a mile through the pass. "They are stones a little larger than a goose egg, I should
judge."

This is an atom: 
"All right," answered the scout, with a confident nod. "I reckon I'll see 'em, if they kin
be seen, Wild."

This is an atom: 
A minute or two later they came to the very spot where Wild had seen the villain disappear
the night before.

This is an atom: 
The boys could tell when he got there right away, as he had noticed the spot where he had dismounted,
the ground being rather soft there; and the hoofprints, as well as his own footprints were
discernible.

This is an atom: 
Charlie and Jim noticed the prints, too, and they were almost straining their eyes to catch
sight of the three stones.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly the scout gave an exclamation of satisfaction, and then quickly added:

This is an atom: 
"I see 'em, Wild."

This is an atom: 
"So do I," said Jim, almost at the same instant.

This is an atom: 
"All right, boys. We'll go right on through the pass, and when we come back we'll make an investigation."

This is an atom: 
The girls also saw the three little stones, but when they found that Wild did not seem to want
to make much of them just then they rode on, with only a passing comment.

This is an atom: 
They reached the other end of the pass without meeting a human being or seeing anything that
would indicate the presence of any.

This is an atom: 
Then they dismounted and took a look at the sign that was posted there.

This is an atom: 
It was so nearly like the other that if the two had been side by side the difference could
not have been told.

This is an atom: 
This one was nailed to a big tree, and after he had looked it over Wild decided to take it
down and see if there was anything on the other side of it.

This is an atom: 
He used the butt of a revolver in place of a hammer and soon knocked the barrel-head loose
from the tree.

This is an atom: 
Then it was quickly pried off.

This is an atom: 
Much to his satisfaction, he saw that there was some lettering on the back of the sign.

This is an atom: 
But it was done in black, and the letters were daubed on in a careless way, such as a shipping
house clerk does it.

This is an atom: 
Young Wild West's face lighted up with a smile as he read the following:

This is an atom: 
"Cap Roche,"
    "General Store,"
    "Silver Bend, Nev."

This is an atom: 
"What do you think of that?" he asked, holding the barrel-head so his companions could read
it. "I reckon we know where the material to make the sign came from now."

This is an atom: 
"Great gimlets!" exclaimed Cheyenne Charlie. "If you hadn't seen Roche go inter ther cave last
night you would know now that he was connected with ther outlaws. This is what I calls great!"

This is an atom: 
"Well, I'll just put the sign up again," said our hero, after a moment of thought. "But I'll
put it so the back part can be read. It may make Cap Roche wonder a little, and if anybody
else, not connected with his gang, sees it they may do a little studying and wondering."

This is an atom: 
He soon knocked the nails out, and then he lost no time in nailing the sign to the tree in
the manner he had proposed to do.

This is an atom: 
"There you are!" he said. "You can't see the words as plainly as you could the others; but
I reckon they can be read all right, if one takes the trouble to get up a little close to the
tree."

This is an atom: 
"I reckon if any one comes this way they'll notice it quick enough," the scout declared.

This is an atom: 
As they intended to go no further, they simply took a look at the trail that came around the
mountain at that point and then continued on toward the southwest.

This is an atom: 
"There's the way to Silver Bend," said Wild. "I reckon we'll go through there when we get done
with Forbidden Pass."

This is an atom: 
"That's right, Wild," Arietta spoke up. "We will need something from the general store that
can't be bought in Big Bonanza."

This is an atom: 
They all laughed at this, and then, mounting their horses, turned and rode back into the narrow
pass.

This is an atom: 
The mile to the spot where the secret entrance to the cave had been discovered by our hero
the night before was soon made, and then they came to a halt.

This is an atom: 
Wild was just going to dismount to make an examination when a revolver shot sounded and his
hat was knocked off his head.

This is an atom: 
The next instant fully a dozen came down the rocky side of the pass and confronted them with
drawn revolvers.

This is an atom: 
"Hands up--everybody!" called out one of them, who was easily recognized as Chuck Snivel, the
cowboy.

This is an atom: 
Crack--crack!

This is an atom: 
Charlie fired two shots in quick succession, and then urged the girls to flee.

This is an atom: 
Wild saw that nearly all the men were pointing their weapons at him, so he thought it best
to obey the command.

This is an atom: 
He seemed to be the one they wanted, and he felt that one hostile word from him would insure
his death.

This is an atom: 
Two of the outlaws had dropped when the scout fired, but the others were so close upon them
that Wild was seized and pulled from his horse in less than a second, almost.

This is an atom: 
The young deadshot struck at them with his clenched fists and made it decidedly unpleasant
for them.

This is an atom: 
But he knew he could not get away, and he was simply doing this to give his companions a chance.

This is an atom: 
They all took advantage of it but one, and that was Arietta.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon you'll pay toll fur coming through Forbidden Pass, Young Wild West!" one of the villains
exclaimed. "Hold him tight, boys! I'm glad yer didn't kill him when that shot was fired at
him. I told Chuck not ter do it. Ther captain wants him alive. Git ther gal, too! This is what
I call collectin' toll, all right!"

This is an atom: 
Arietta's horse had been seized by the bit, and a ruffianly fellow stood holding him with one
hand, while his other held a revolver that was pointed at the girl's breast.

This is an atom: 
The rest of the party had succeeded in getting around a bend, but Wild knew they would not
go very far.

This is an atom: 
But before they had time to get back and do anything both he and Arietta were dragged up close
to what seemed to be the rocky wall of the cliff.

This is an atom: 
Then the curtain rolled up, and in they went, the outlaws following with those who had fallen
and the horses.

This is an atom: 
It was all done so quickly that our hero found himself in the darkness before he fairly realized
what had happened.

This is an atom: 
Arietta uttered a scream as she was hurried into the mouth of the hidden cave, but a hand was
quickly placed over her mouth, and that ended any further chance to let Charlie and the rest
know where they were being carried.

This is an atom: 
Wild's weapons were taken from him while he was being dragged into the cave, and it was a very
rough handling that he received.

This is an atom: 
But he knew how useless it was, so he did no further struggling.

This is an atom: 
The fact that the rest had succeeded in getting away was a little consolation, for that meant
that they would come back and effect a rescue.

This is an atom: 
Our hero placed the utmost dependence on Charlie and Jim, for they had never failed him yet.

This is an atom: 
In through the short passage the outlaws took them, and then into the big cave.

This is an atom: 
They paused here long enough to bind the boy's hands and then Chuck Snivel, who was in command,
said:

This is an atom: 
"Outside into the hole with him, boys. Tie him to the post until Cap comes. We'll keep the
girl here. I reckon we'll collect the toll all right."

This is an atom: 
"It will be a dear toll, too," spoke up the man who had cautioned him not to kill the boy.
"Two of us went under, I s'pose you know."

This is an atom: 
"An' no amount of money will bring 'em back ter life," chimed in another.

This is an atom: 
"There'll be a lot more of you go under before you collect your toll!" exclaimed Young Wild
West, who had now fully recovered from the surprise he had been treated to. "Just wait!"

This is an atom: 
"That's all right, boy," Chuck Snivel answered, "You know how I feel toward you, I reckon.
You don't have no idea that you're ever goin' ter git away from here alive, do yer?"

This is an atom: 
"I haven't the least doubt but that I will," was the calm retort.

This is an atom: 
"Well, jest see how mistaken you'll be. I'm goin' ter be ther one what will kill yer! Do yer
understand that?"

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER IX.

This is an atom: 
ARIETTA ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE.

This is an atom: 
At a word from Snivel Young Wild West was dragged along through the big cave to a place that
was almost directly opposite to the entrance.

This is an atom: 
The light that was admitted through the cracks in the front was sufficient for our hero to
see that it was another passage that he was being taken to.

This is an atom: 
He had heard the villain in command of the men say that he was to be taken outside and put
in the hole until the leader came, but just what that meant he did not know.

This is an atom: 
He was destined to find out very soon, however, for the passage did not extend many feet.

This is an atom: 
A sharp turn in it and he saw a natural hollow, with steep walls of rock on either side, right
before him.

This is an atom: 
It looked very much like the pass, but he knew it could not be, for they would not take him
out there again.

This is an atom: 
Another thing, the end of the opening, or hole, as it might be called, was but fifty yards away.

This is an atom: 
Some parts of this wall was very steep, and others looked as though it could be climbed.

This is an atom: 
On one side, not far from the passage he was taken from, was a stout post that was planted
firmly in the ground.

This is an atom: 
To this Wild was taken, and being placed in an upright position, with his back to it, he was
firmly tied to the post.

This is an atom: 
"There!" exclaimed Chuck Snivel, fiendishly. "I reckon you'll stay there just as long as we
want yer to, Young Wild West."

This is an atom: 
"All right," was the calm rejoinder. "I hope you won't want me to stay here very long. I don't
like this kind of business."

This is an atom: 
Some of the outlaws laughed, while others glared at him savagely.

This is an atom: 
His style did not exactly suit them. He was too cool by far.

This is an atom: 
Then, again, two of their number had fallen during the struggle to capture the brave boy and
his sweetheart, and that made them feel all the more ugly toward him.

This is an atom: 
"You was goin' through ther pass an' yer wasn't goin' ter pay no toll, Young Wild West!" exclaimed
Snivel, after a short pause. "I reckon yer found out your mistake all right. We seen yer when
yer went through, an' we jest got ready fur yer when yer come back. Yer couldn't have stopped
in a better place, fur ye was right in front of our cave. Yer jest walked right inter ther
trap we had set fur yer."

This is an atom: 
"That's all right," Wild answered, coolly. "You have won the first trick in the game, that
isn't going to count for much. I've been in just such fixes as this, and I have always got
out of them. You couldn't scare me if you tried for a week!"

This is an atom: 
"You talk it nice; but yer will change your tune afore you're many hours older. Thought it
was fine fun ter make me dance last night, didn't yer? Oh, but I'm gittin' square, all right."

This is an atom: 
"You'll wish you had never met me before I am done with you."

This is an atom: 
"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed the villain. "Hear him talk, boys! He acts jest as though he ain't no
prisoner. He's got nerve enough fur ten, I reckon."

This is an atom: 
"I reckon it's his bluff that's always carried him through," remarked one of the outlaws, as
he looked at the helpless boy and nodded. "But there's always a time, yer know. Young Wild
West has gone ther length of his rope!"

This is an atom: 
"I reckon you'll find that my rope is a great deal longer than you think," Wild answered, thinking
it good policy to keep in conversation with them, as the more time Charlie and Jim had to figure
out a way of helping him the better it would be.

This is an atom: 
"Ha, ha, ha!"

This is an atom: 
Again Snivel laughed.

This is an atom: 
It was evident that he was very sure that it was all up with Young Wild West.

This is an atom: 
The success the outlaws had met with since they had established their quarters in the cave
no doubt made them confident that they could not be ousted.

This is an atom: 
"Boys," said Snivel, as he turned from our hero, evidently satisfied that he could gain nothing
by trying to frighten him, "I reckon you had better bury ther bodies of Pete an' Simon. I don't
know as there's any use in waitin' fur Cap ter come. He won't be here till some time after
dinner, he said when he went away last night. He's tryin' ter git ther stage coach ter run
through ther pass ag'in, an' if it does we'll let it go fur ther first two or three trips,
an' then when they've got a good pile aboard we're goin' ter nab on it. Cap knows his business,
all right; an' we make more by his bein' away than we do when he's here."

This is an atom: 
"That's right," answered the man, who seemed to have more to say than any of the rest. "I reckon
we'll go ahead with our funeral. I'll take what they've got on 'em, an' you kin put in ther
box inside, so ther boss kin take charge of it. I know they both must have had a few dollars
when this unexpected business happened. This are too bad! It's ther first loss we've met with
since we've been banded together."

This is an atom: 
"That's right, Aleck," replied Snivel. "You go ahead. Joe an' Dick kin go ahead an' dig ther
grave that'll answer fur ther pair of 'em. Poor fellers! They never knowed what struck 'em,
fur ther galoots what fired them shots aimed 'em mighty straight, an' there was no sufferin'
done. I'm mighty glad I wasn't in ther way of one of them bullets."

This is an atom: 
"Well, we all are, as fur as that goes. But it's a shame that they had ter be snuffed out that
way."

This is an atom: 
He went away to attend to the work assigned him, as did the others who had been named.

This is an atom: 
Then Snivel walked back into the cave, leaving Wild to his own reflections.

This is an atom: 
The villain found Arietta sitting on a box, over which some skins had been thrown to make it
comfortable.

This is an atom: 
The girl had not been tied, the villains evidently thinking that there was no danger of her
escaping, as she was but a girl.

This is an atom: 
But she was being closely watched, just the same, for those left to guard her could not help
noticing that she was not afraid.

This is an atom: 
"Well, miss," said Snivel, apologetically, "I'm mighty sorry ter see you in such a fix as this.
What did yer want ter come through Forbidden Pass fur, anyhow? Didn't yer read ther sign?"

This is an atom: 
"I wanted to come through, so I could pay the toll, and I will do it when the proper time comes,"
was the reply in a steady voice.

This is an atom: 
"You pay ther toll! Why, have yer got a big pile of money?"

This is an atom: 
"Not here. But I think I can pay it, though."

This is an atom: 
"Where is your money, gal?"

This is an atom: 
The lieutenant of the outlaw band became interested right away.

This is an atom: 
"I don't know as I have got to tell you where my money is," replied Arietta, coolly. "You don't
suppose it is anywhere near here, do you? I wouldn't be wise if I carried a big pile of money
around with me, would I?"

This is an atom: 
"Well, I don't know about that part of it. But it would be all ther better fur us, I reckon,"
and the man grinned, as though he thought he had got off a pretty good joke. "But jest tell
me how yer expect ter pay ther toll?"

This is an atom: 
"I'll show you that when the time comes," was the reply.

This is an atom: 
"But can't yer tell me now?"

This is an atom: 
"No, because I don't just know how I am going to pay it. But I am going to do it, just the same."

This is an atom: 
"I s'pose yer mean that you're goin' ter pay somethin' ter be let go free," observed the villain,
after thinking a minute or two. "Well, it will depend on what ther captain says about you gittin'
away. I don't hardly think he'll be in favor of lettin' you go, no matter how much yer agree
ter pay."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, I will get away as soon as Young Wild West gets out of here. He won't be long in finding
a way to release me."

This is an atom: 
"Miss, if you're dependin' on anything like that ter happen jest git it off your mind. Young
Wild West ain't never goin' ter git out of here alive. I've swore that I'll kill him; an' ther
boss of our gang wouldn't think of lettin' him live, nohow. Jest make up your mind that ther
boys has got ter die, an' that you're likely ter go ther same way yourself. There's nothin'
like resignin' yourself to your fate, yer know."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, is that so?"

This is an atom: 
Arietta looked at him with flashing eyes.

This is an atom: 
Her defiant way struck Snivel as something wonderful, coming from a defenseless girl, as it did.

This is an atom: 
He did not know that she had a six-shooter in the bosom of her dress, which had been overlooked
when she was disarmed.

This is an atom: 
But Arietta always carried the weapon there.

This is an atom: 
It was of smaller calibre than the one she always carried at her belt, but it was deadly enough
at short range.

This is an atom: 
The revolver had been given her by Young Wild West on her sixteenth birthday, and several times
it had stood her in good stead.

This is an atom: 
At the very minute that Snivel was talking to her she was thinking of bringing the weapon into use.

This is an atom: 
Arietta had heard enough to make her believe that her dashing young lover was not to be harmed
for a while, for she had been listening when the men were talking about Cap Roche, and she
had not failed to make note of it when they said that he was not due at the cave until some
time after the hour of noon.

This is an atom: 
Before Snivel came in from the rear entrance she had been carefully studying the cave, and
she knew just the way to get out.

This is an atom: 
She thought that the quicker she did it the better it would be for both herself and Wild.

This is an atom: 
She determined that she would act right now.

This is an atom: 
"Can I have a drink of water?" she asked, as Snivel was about to pull up a stool near her.

This is an atom: 
"Sartin," was the reply. "I'll go an' fetch yer one right from ther spring."

This is an atom: 
There were only two men besides the lieutenant of the band in the cave just then, and they
were back near the rear.

This is an atom: 
Snivel went and got a tin cup and as he turned his back to go and fetch the water Arietta arose
and stepped lightly across the cave.

This is an atom: 
She had almost reached the passage that led out to the pass when one of the outlaws saw her
and raised the alarm.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER X.

This is an atom: 
"THAT MAKES FOUR OF YOU!"

This is an atom: 
As the outlaw's warning cry sounded through the cave Arietta gave a shout of defiance and darted
into the passage.

This is an atom: 
Like Wild, she had seen the curtain lifted when she was carried into the cave, and she knew
that curtain was not far away.

This is an atom: 
It was doubtful if she would be fired at by the villains, she thought, but there was really
no telling, so she drew her revolver and looked over her shoulder as she ran.

This is an atom: 
Both the man who saw her when she was nearly out and the other villain were now running swiftly
through the cave, and each of them had a drawn revolver.

This is an atom: 
Arietta ran as far as she could go, and then she came in contact with the painted curtain.

This is an atom: 
She did not know how to manipulate it, of course, so the best thing she could do was to reach
for the bottom and lift it.

This is an atom: 
This she did, and, much to her joy, it came up easily.

This is an atom: 
A quick move and she had darted under it and was outside in the pass.

This is an atom: 
Then it was that she gave a cry of delight, for Cheyenne Charlie was right there to greet her.

This is an atom: 
The girl did not say a word, however, but motioned for the scout to get behind a rock that
was close at hand.

This is an atom: 
She darted after him as he obeyed her, and then out came the foremost of the men who were chasing
her.

This is an atom: 
Crack!

This is an atom: 
The scout fired without any hesitation and down went the villain in a heap.

This is an atom: 
But his action checked the others from coming out, and the curtain went down in a jiffy.

This is an atom: 
Arietta's action in lifting it had caused the log to fall and pull it up to its full height.

This is an atom: 
"That's putty good, I reckon," said Charlie, smiling grimly. "Is Wild all right, Arietta?"

This is an atom: 
"He is safe for the present, I think," was the girl's reply. "They are waiting for the captain
to come. He won't be here until some time after dinner, so there is a good chance of saving Wild."

This is an atom: 
"If that's ther case, I reckon there'll he a good chance, fur ther captain will never git here!"

This is an atom: 
There was no mistaking the meaning of Cheyenne Charlie just then.

This is an atom: 
Cap Roche's life was surely in danger if he showed up in Forbidden Pass that day!

This is an atom: 
"Take him alive, Charlie," advised Arietta, "Where are Jim and the girls?"

This is an atom: 
"Right back there a little ways," was the reply. "But you jest leave it ter me ter settle with
Cap Roche. I'll show ther two-faced galoot what's what!"

This is an atom: 
Arietta said no more, but hurried through the pass in the direction Charlie had indicated.

This is an atom: 
She found the rest waiting for her, for they had heard the shot, and had seen her with Charlie.

This is an atom: 
"Is Wild all right?" Dart asked, anxiously.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, for a while, anyhow," was the reply as Anna and Eloise both tried to embrace her at one time.

This is an atom: 
She quickly let them know the situation, and then she turned her attention to the spot where
Charlie was in waiting for the outlaws to show themselves.

This is an atom: 
The scout's blood was up now, and she knew quite well that he would shoot the villains as fast
as they showed themselves.

This is an atom: 
Ten minutes passed by, and no one showed up.

This is an atom: 
Charlie was waiting patiently, however.

This is an atom: 
He was confident that one of the outlaws would want to get out to see what had happened to
the fellow that followed in pursuit of the escaping girl.

This is an atom: 
But Charlie did not know that the villains had a peephole in that cleverly contrived curtain,
and that they had already looked through it and learned that their comrade was dead on the ground.

This is an atom: 
To say that the outlaws were enraged at what had happened would be putting it mildly.

This is an atom: 
The girls escape had happened so unexpectedly that they could hardly realize it, and then,
right on the back of it, another man is shot!

This is an atom: 
"Chuck," said the man called Bob, "I reckon we're in fur it."

This is an atom: 
"Don't say that," was the retort. "Ain't we got Young Wild West hard an' fast?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, an' we thought we had ther gal that way, too. But she ain't here now, is she?"

This is an atom: 
"Well, I wouldn't care two cents about her, if it wasn't that it was through her that Wally
got shot."

This is an atom: 
"Poor Wally! An' jest as we was fillin' up ther grave of ther other two, too. Well, yer didn't
finish their job, did yer?"

This is an atom: 
"No; when we heard ther hubbub inside we stopped an' run in."

This is an atom: 
"An' left Young Wild West out there alone, eh?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes; but he couldn't git away; you know that well enough."

This is an atom: 
"There ain't no tellin' what he might do."

This is an atom: 
Snivel hurried out of the rear of the cave.

This is an atom: 
But the prisoner was still there, tied to the post, just as he had been left.

This is an atom: 
The horses of the outlaws had been led out there, and they were cropping at some sparse grass
that grew there.

This is an atom: 
As the sun did not get much of a chance at the bottom of the hole, as it was called by the
outlaws, the vegetation there was scarce.

This is an atom: 
"So you're here yet, eh?" said Snivel, as he stepped up to the boy.

This is an atom: 
"Why, yes," was the reply. "You didn't think I was going to leave so soon, did you?"

This is an atom: 
"No, I didn't think so. But funny things is happenin' jest about now."

This is an atom: 
"What was the matter in the cave?"

This is an atom: 
Wild asked the question in an indifferent way, but he was really anxious to hear, for he had
no idea that Arietta had made her escape.

This is an atom: 
He had heard the shot, too, and he was eager to find out what it all meant.

This is an atom: 
"Yer want ter know what was ther matter in ther cave, eh?" asked Snivel, looking at the boy
and scowling. "Well, I don't know as it will do any hurt ter tell yer. Ther gal got away from
us--that's what was ther matter."

This is an atom: 
"Is that so? Who fired the shot I heard?"

This is an atom: 
"One of your pards, I s'pose."

This is an atom: 
"Did it hit any one?"

This is an atom: 
"I reckon it did. Another of our men got laid out. Oh, this is only makin' it all ther worse
fur you, Young Wild West. You don't stand no livin' show, so there's no use in thinkin' yer do."

This is an atom: 
"I wish Cap Roche would come, so I call find out my fate," said Wild, though he did not mean it.

This is an atom: 
The longer the leader of the outlaws stayed away the better were his chances of being rescued
by his partners.

This is an atom: 
"How do you know that Cap Roche is ther one that's goin' ter settle about your fate, Young
Wild West?"

This is an atom: 
"Why, I have heard you fellows talking about him."

This is an atom: 
"Yer did, eh? I reckon yer never heard none of us say any more than Cap. We didn't say that
Cap Roche had anything ter do with our crowd."

This is an atom: 
"Well, I thought you did."

This is an atom: 
"I don't know as it makes any difference, though. You ain't never goin' away from here alive.
Ther toll that you'll pay is your life, Young Wild West! Cap Roche will soon say that."

This is an atom: 
"Maybe he will, and maybe he won't," retorted our hero, as calmly as though he was simply talking
business with a friend. "Cap Roche might take a notion to let me go. His business at the store
in Silver Bend might require him to do so."

This is an atom: 
"I reckon he'd be a fool ter let yer go. Where would he land if he did?'

This is an atom: 
"Well, if he made a deal with me he might land all right."

This is an atom: 
Wild was adopting different tactics now. Anything to gain time, and he thought that he might
get the men in the humor to make terms for his release.

This is an atom: 
Not that he meant to pay the "toll," as they called it; but if he could make them believe that
he had a large sum of money at his command it might work all right.

This is an atom: 
The fact was that our hero had very little money on his person.

This is an atom: 
His experience had taught him not to carry much with him.

This is an atom: 
Therefore, he always kept the bulk of what he brought with him in a hidden pocket in his saddlebags.

This is an atom: 
Hop was the one who had taught him that this was the safest way, for road agents seldom took
a notion to make a thorough search of a horseman's saddlebags.

This is an atom: 
"How much money have yet got with yer, Young Wild West?" Snivel asked.

This is an atom: 
"Not much. But I have plenty in the banks of Denver and Phoenix."

This is an atom: 
"Denver an' Phoenix is both a mighty good distance from here."

This is an atom: 
"I know that. But an order from me would fetch the money any time you went for it."

This is an atom: 
"That's so, too."

This is an atom: 
"And my word is worth as much as my money, I reckon!"

This is an atom: 
"I don't know about that. I wouldn't take ther word of any one. I don't think any one would
tell ther truth in a case like this."

This is an atom: 
"Well, there is no use in flying, to make a deal with you, then. I'll wait till the captain
comes, I reckon."

This is an atom: 
"He's ther one ter talk ter, anyhow."

This is an atom: 
It was just then that another shot sounded from the pass.

This is an atom: 
The next minute Bob came running out of the rear of the cave.

This is an atom: 
"Another man got his medicine, Chuck!" he exclaimed. "He would go out ter git ther body of
Wally, an' he got shot down afore he could git hold of it!"

This is an atom: 
"That makes four of you!" said Young Wild West coolly gazing at the villains. "Where do you
think you are coming out in this game?"

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XI.

This is an atom: 
WHAT HOP WAH DID.

This is an atom: 
Though he had been told to remain with Wing and watch the camp, Hop grew so restless after
our friends had been gone about half an hour that he decided to follow them and see if he could
not assist in hunting down the outlaws.

This is an atom: 
He had heard enough of the conversation to make him understand just how the hidden cave was
located, and he relied on his sleight-of-hand work to help him.

This is an atom: 
If there was anything that the Chinaman liked it was to do something that met with the approval
of Young Wild West.

This is an atom: 
After he had once got it into his head that he wanted to go Hop grew very restless.

This is an atom: 
Finally he turned to the cook and said:

This is an atom: 
"Me go takee lillee walk thlough um pass, so be, my blother."

This is an atom: 
"Misler Wild say you, allee samee stay here, so be," was the reply.

This is an atom: 
"Lat allee light. But me 'flaid Misler Wild allee samee git tee in um tlouble; me wantee helpee
out."

This is an atom: 
Wing did not care if he did go, for he thought he was perfectly able to take care of the camp.

This is an atom: 
So when Hop said he thought Wild might be in trouble he nodded and retorted:

This is an atom: 
"Allee light; my blother go if he wantee to. Me allee samee stay here, likee Misler Wild say."

This is an atom: 
"Lat light, my blother. You velly muchee goodee Chinee; but you no understand, likee me; me
allee samee velly muchee smartee, allee samee my uncle in China."

This is an atom: 
"Um uncle in China allee samee dead; git tee head cuttee off for stealee pig!"

This is an atom: 
"Sh!" said Hop, holding up his hand. "My blother mustee not lettee Misler Charlie knowee lat."

This is an atom: 
"Me no care, so be. You allee samee foolee."

This is an atom: 
Wing acted as though he was disgusted, but a sorrowful look from his brother soon brought him
around.

This is an atom: 
"Me no tellee Misler Charlie," he said.

This is an atom: 
"Allee light. Now me go to um saloon and git tee lillee dlop of tanglefoot; len me go and havee
lillee look alound up Forbiddee Passee, so be."

This is an atom: 
Hop was not long in getting ready.

This is an atom: 
Without another word he set out for the saloon.

This is an atom: 
The miners were all at work by this time, so there was no one there but Hoker and the man he
had to help him.

This is an atom: 
They were both busy cleaning up the place when the Chinaman entered, but they greeted him cordially.

This is an atom: 
"Where's Young Wild West?" asked Hoker, though he well knew that he had started out to go through
Forbidden Pass.

This is an atom: 
"He takee lillee tlip to huntee uppee some outlaws, so be," answered the Chinaman. "Me likee
havee lillee tanglefoot; len me go outee huntee, too, so be."

This is an atom: 
"Is that so? Well, I don't know how much of a hunter you are, but if yer are as good at it
as yer are with ther cards you'll make out all right, I reckon."

This is an atom: 
"Lat light."

This is an atom: 
Hop got his drink, and then he had a flask filled with whisky for use later on.

This is an atom: 
"Now, len," said he, blandly, "me chuck dicee to see if me pay or you givee me um tanglefoot."

This is an atom: 
"No yer don't!" was the quick reply. "You fork over ther money. I ain't goin' inter no gamblin'
game with you. You're too much fur me, an' I ain't ashamed ter own up ter it."

This is an atom: 
Hop grinned and paid the bill.

This is an atom: 
Then he put the flask in his pocket and set out for the pass.

This is an atom: 
He had heard Wild say that the spot where the hidden cave was located was only about a mile
from the camp, so that made a nice, little walk for him.

This is an atom: 
The fact was that Hop did not mind walking, anyhow.

This is an atom: 
He was in the saddle so much that it was a relief to get the opportunity to walk around once
in a while.

This is an atom: 
Reaching the pass, he took a good look at the sign and gave a nod of approval.

This is an atom: 
Hop had learned to read English pretty well, though he could not speak it with any great degree
of accuracy.

This is an atom: 
But he did not want to do any better than what he did in that line, for his style just suited him.

This is an atom: 
"Make pay allee samee toll, so be," he said, musingly. "Whattee lat?"

This is an atom: 
That was just a little too much for him.

This is an atom: 
But he was not going to let it worry him any, so he started through the pass without any further
delay.

This is an atom: 
The trail made by our friends was very plain in places, and Hop took notice of this fact.

This is an atom: 
He walked along leisurely, taking in all he saw, which was not a great deal, since there were
nothing but cliffs and the blue sky above to be seen.

This is an atom: 
He kept right on until finally he rounded a turn in the pass and saw Jim Dart and the girls
about a hundred yards ahead.

This is an atom: 
As they were gathered behind a big rock, as though hiding, he knew that something was wrong
right away.

This is an atom: 
Hop came to a pause.

This is an atom: 
Though he wanted to know what was up, he felt that it would be best to go it alone, so he did
not walk ahead and join them.

This is an atom: 
While he stood back close to the cliff a revolver shot rang out.

This is an atom: 
He saw Jim raise his head above the rock and take a quick look in the direction it came from,
and then all was still.

This is an atom: 
It so happened that Hop had got there just in time to hear the shot that ended the career of
the fourth outlaw.

This is an atom: 
The Chinaman did not know what it meant, so he looked for a way to get up close to Jim and
the girls without being seen by them.

This is an atom: 
If he went on through the narrow defile he could not do it.

This is an atom: 
Then he looked up and, much to his satisfaction, he saw a place that could be climbed quite
easily, he thought.

This is an atom: 
He decided to go on up, and then work his way along until he was directly above those in waiting.

This is an atom: 
Hop was quite agile for a Chinaman who did not like work a great deal.

This is an atom: 
He was soon ascending the craggy way, and in less than two minutes he was at the top of the cliff.

This is an atom: 
Once there he found that it was comparatively level, and he walked along fearlessly.

This is an atom: 
But he could not help noticing that there was a fissure similar to that which formed the pass
on the other side, and, being curious to see what was down there, he made his way to the edge.

This is an atom: 
A smothered cry of astonishment came from the Chinaman's lips as he peered downward.

This is an atom: 
It was the "hole," as the outlaws termed it, that Hop was looking into, and there was Young
Wild West, tied to the post, in plain view!

This is an atom: 
"Lat petty goodie--or petty bids, so be!" exclaimed Hop, under his breath, "Me finder Misler
Wild petty quicken. But um bad Mexican mans goatee him, so be."

This is an atom: 
Keeping out of sight, he lay flat at the top of the cliff and saw the excited outlaws as they
moved about in the hole below him.

This is an atom: 
The distance was about forty feet, but Hop soon discovered a way to get down, or nearly all
the distance, anyhow.

This is an atom: 
But he did not intend to risk doing it just then.

This is an atom: 
The excited voices of the men came to his ears, and he was not long in making out that they
were talking about a man that had just been shot as he went out to get the body of a comrade.

This is an atom: 
From his position he could see about all there was to be seen in the fissure.

This is an atom: 
There was the grave the villains had placed the two bodies in, and which they had started to fill.

This is an atom: 
He counted ten men there, too, and he shook his head when he found there were so many of them.

This is an atom: 
"Misler Wild allee samee in um bad box, so be," he muttered. "Me better go tell Misler Jim, so be."

This is an atom: 
Having decided upon this plan of action, he crawled away from the edge of the cliff and made
his way down into the pass.

This is an atom: 
It was easier to get down than it was to come up, and once there he started boldly for Jim
and the girls.

This is an atom: 
He was within twenty feet of them when Arietta turned and saw him.

This is an atom: 
"Here is Hop!" she exclaimed in a low voice. "Maybe he can help us out."

This is an atom: 
Jim brightened when he saw the clever Chinaman, for he knew very well that Hop had been of
great value to them in such cases.

This is an atom: 
"Come here," he said, beckoning to him. "Don't make any noise, Hop."

This is an atom: 
"Me no makee noisee," was the reply. "Me knowee allee 'boutee; me just see Misler Wild. He
tied to um post, and ten mans by him. Allee samee velly muchee bad workee."

This is an atom: 
"You saw Wild!" Arietta exclaimed, looking at the Chinaman in surprise.

This is an atom: 
"Lat allee samee light, Missy Alietta."

This is an atom: 
"Where did you see him?"

This is an atom: 
"Me go uppee lere, and me allee samee lookee down on um other side, so be."

This is an atom: 
"Great Scott!" cried Jim Dart. "Who would have thought of doing that? Hop, you are a dandy!"

This is an atom: 
"Me velly muchee smartee Chinee, so be," was the reply. "Where Misler Charlie? Me takee and
showee where Misler Wild is velly muchee quicken, so be."

This is an atom: 
Jim gave a signal, which was answered right away by the scout, who was crouching behind a big
boulder, right close to the curtained entrance of the cave.

This is an atom: 
The next minute Charlie was seen approaching them.

This is an atom: 
"Come on," said Jim. "Hop has seen Wild, and he wants to show us where he is."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XII.

This is an atom: 
THE OUTLAWS TAKE SOME MORE PRISONERS.

This is an atom: 
As soon as Hop had explained just how they could get up to the top of the ridge Cheyenne Charlie
was eager to go.

This is an atom: 
"Ther gals kin go back ter Big Bonanza, I reckon," he said. "Then there won't be any danger
of 'em gittin' hurt."

This is an atom: 
Anna and Eloise were perfectly willing to this, but Arietta shook her head.

This is an atom: 
"I am going to stay here till Wild is free," she declared.

This is an atom: 
The scout knew very well that there was no use in arguing the question with her. Arietta had
a mind of her own, and the only one she would ever listen to was Young Wild West.

This is an atom: 
"All right," the scout said, "Hop, you jest show us where yer got up there, an' me an' Jim
will go up an' take a look."

This is an atom: 
He quickly showed them, and then Charlie and Jim at once began to ascend.

This is an atom: 
Arietta promptly followed them.

This is an atom: 
"Hop, you stay here with the girls till we come back," she said, "Keep a watch, and if anything
happens call out to us."

This is an atom: 
"Allee light, Missy Alietta," he answered, though he would have much liked to go up with them,
since it was he who had made the important discovery.

This is an atom: 
Young Wild West's two partners and Arietta were soon out of sight.

This is an atom: 
Anna and Eloise watched them until they disappeared, and they continued to look where they
had last seen them.

This is an atom: 
If they had only looked the other way they might have saved themselves a lot of trouble.

This is an atom: 
Or if Hop had kept a watch, as Arietta told him to, things would surely have turned out differently.

This is an atom: 
It so happened that Cap Roche had changed his mind about waiting until after the hour of noon
before paying a visit to the cave, and he was riding up the pass in company with one of his
men at that very moment.

This is an atom: 
In watching the climbers the two girls had exposed themselves to the view of any one approaching,
and when Cap Roche and his man suddenly came in sight of the two so near the hidden cave they
were astonished.

This is an atom: 
One of the cowboys who had seen our friends when they came to Big Bonanza was his companion,
and he was not long in recognizing Anna and Eloise.

This is an atom: 
"Cap," he whispered, "they belong to Young Wild West's crowd. I wonder what they kin he doin'
here?"

This is an atom: 
"Is that so?" queried the leader. "Well, I'll soon find out what they are doing here. I reckon
we had better catch them and take them in the cave. That will be a bold stroke, I think. The
chances are that Young Wild West is around here somewhere."

This is an atom: 
They dismounted and moved cautiously toward the girls.

This is an atom: 
When they got directly in front of the cave they were astonished to see the bodies of two of
their men lying there.

This is an atom: 
The eyes of the leader flashed dangerously.

This is an atom: 
"Young Wild West has been at work, I reckon!" he exclaimed, in a low voice. "Come on! We had
better go in first and see if everything is all right there."

This is an atom: 
It was at that moment that the curtain rolled up, for the man on watch had seen them.

This is an atom: 
They hurried to him and learned the situation, as far as the man knew it.

This is an atom: 
But the fact that Young Wild West was a prisoner so elated the villainous leader of the outlaw
gang that he felt like giving a shout of joy.

This is an atom: 
He restrained himself, however, and then quickly made up his mind to capture the two girls outside.

This is an atom: 
Another man who was inside the cave was called, and then the four set out to carry out their
foul purpose.

This is an atom: 
As they crept nearer to the unsuspecting girls, who were now talking in whispers and waiting
patiently for the return of their companions, they found that there was a Chinaman with them.

This is an atom: 
"Catch all three of them, and don't let them have a chance to utter a cry," was the order from
Cap Roche.

This is an atom: 
Stealthily the four villains crept upon the unsuspecting ones, and two minutes later all three
of them were struggling in the grasp of the outlaws.

This is an atom: 
Though it had been planned quickly, it was well done, and, unable to make an outcry, Hop and
the two girls were carried bodily into the cave.

This is an atom: 
A whistle brought half dozen to their assistance, and then the prisoners were bound and told
to be silent.

This is an atom: 
"If you scream it will do no good, for if your friends start to come in here they will be shot
down like wolves!" said Cap Roche, smiling fiendishly. "The best thing you can do is to take
it easy."

This is an atom: 
Having said this, he turned to his men and ordered that the two bodies be brought in.

This is an atom: 
This was done, though those who did it were very cautious in their movements, since they expected
to be shot down at any moment.

This is an atom: 
Much relieved, the outlaws carried the bodies through the cave to the hole outside.

This is an atom: 
"Now," said the leader, "just tie the prisoners to the table."

This is an atom: 
This was soon done, Hop pleading to be released in vain.

This is an atom: 
"Go and fetch Young Wild West here," said Roche. "We will have them all together while I talk
to them."

This is an atom: 
Chuck Snivel hastened to do the bidding of his boss.

This is an atom: 
He went out to the post and began untying the captive boy.

This is an atom: 
"Cap Roche has got here, an' he wants ter see yer, Young Wild West," he said.

This is an atom: 
"All right," answered the boy, not knowing whether to believe him or not. "He'll find that
I am all right, I reckon."

This is an atom: 
His ankles being untied, Wild walked along readily.

This is an atom: 
The captain was standing near the table waiting for him.

This is an atom: 
When Wild saw Anna, Eloise and Hop prisoners there he could scarcely believe his eyes.

This is an atom: 
Things were surely getting worse, instead of better, he thought.

This is an atom: 
But he did not let the captives think that he was anything like discouraged over the prospect.

This is an atom: 
"How are you, Mr. Roche?" he said, coolly. "How is business over at the store and post office?"

This is an atom: 
The villain smiled at this.

This is an atom: 
"You're a pretty cool one, I must say," he retorted. "I suppose it was you who turned the sign
over?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes; I thought I would let travelers know that you were one of the outlaws who demanded toll
from those who pass this way."

This is an atom: 
"Well, I hardly think your plan worked, then, for I took the trouble to right the sign a little
while ago. Well, what do you think of this business, anyhow? Sorry you came to Forbidden Pass,
are you not?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, no. This is pretty bad for me just now. But it won't last very long. If you want to save
trouble you had better release me, and the others you have got here, and then light out somewhere.
If you don't you will only be sorry for it. You think you have got the best of me now, but
in a short time you will find out that it will be just the other way. You don't suppose that
I came here without knowing just what I was doing, do you?"

This is an atom: 
"Well, you couldn't have known just what you were doing or this wouldn't have happened."

This is an atom: 
Roche motioned toward the prisoners.

This is an atom: 
"It was a poor way for you to win out, this letting us get you and those others, I think,"
he added.

This is an atom: 
"Well, of course, I did not expect anything like this to happen," Wild answered, coolly. "That
was a pretty good scheme your men put through when they got me. But let me tell you that my
two partners have gone to get a crowd of miners to come here and clean, you out. They know
just how to get in, for they have seen the curtain raised in front of the opening that leads
in here. But they knew all about that last night, for I followed you here and saw you come
in. I told them all about it, and they know just what to do now."

This is an atom: 
Cap Roche looked uneasy.

This is an atom: 
He did not relish the idea of the miners of Big Bonanza finding out about the cave.

This is an atom: 
And he was now pretty certain that they would.

This is an atom: 
The fact that he was known to be the leader of the outlaws made it impossible for him to go
back to Silver Bend, too.

This is an atom: 
Though he had the best of Young Wild West just then, he knew he was in a very bad box.

This is an atom: 
"You have done well, Young Wild West," he said, trying to appear cool. "You have done something
that no one else has been able to do--you have found our cave and exposed the secret of it.
I will admit that you have ruined our game here, but you don't suppose that you are going to
live to enjoy telling about it, do you?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, I don't know. I expect to live a long while, Cap Roche. I reckon you think as much of
your life as I do of mine. If you should kill me you know very well that you would not live
long after doing it. Your friends would never get a chance to do you a good turn, for you would
never fall into the hands of the minions of the law. The only chance you have got is to make
a deal that suits me. If you don't want to do that, do as you please."

This is an atom: 
Cap Roche got up and began pacing the rocky floor of the cave.

This is an atom: 
His uneasiness made his men feel in anything but a pleasant frame of mind.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly he paused in front of Wild and said:

This is an atom: 
"Let's hear your proposition."

This is an atom: 
"I would much rather you would make one," was the calm reply.

This is an atom: 
"Could you guarantee me three days to get away from Silver Bend if I agreed to let you go by
paying the toll?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, I could do that, I suppose."

This is an atom: 
"Well, I'll think it over."

This is an atom: 
"You had better think quickly then."

This is an atom: 
Cap Roche scowled.

This is an atom: 
"See here!" he exclaimed, turning to Hop and quickly severing his bonds. "You go and tell Young
Wild West's partners that I want all the money they can rake up, and as soon as you bring it
to me you can all go free. They are to fetch no one here, though. If they do I will kill Young
Wild West, and then take the chances of a siege in the cave."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XIII.

This is an atom: 
THE CLEVER CHINAMAN AT WORK.

This is an atom: 
Hop no sooner had his hands free than he said:

This is an atom: 
"You wantee me tellee lat ley mustee git tee velly muchee money, and len you lettee Young Wild
West go?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, that's it. You seem to understand pretty well for a Chinee. You understood enough to
clean me out of a couple of hundred dollars last night, too. I reckon you had better give me
that money and all the rest you have, before you go on your errand."

This is an atom: 
"Me velly solly," declared Hop, acting as though he really felt bad over it, "but me leavee
allee my money in um camp."

This is an atom: 
This was a fact, too, as all he had with him was about five dollars in silver.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon I had better go through you," said the leader of the outlaws.

This is an atom: 
Hop quickly produced what money he had, and then held up his arms to let the man make a search
of his clothing.

This is an atom: 
Roche went through him and brought out as many as half a dozen packs of cards, a flask of whisky,
several little vials containing liquids and powders, two or three oblong objects that looked
like a lot of paper pressed together, some black-looking cigars, a dead mouse, some colored
string, and a lot of other small things, too numerous to mention.

This is an atom: 
But there was no money to be found.

This is an atom: 
"That's a nice lot of trash fur a galoot ter have in his pockets," he declared, looking at
the pile in disgust. "What are you doing with a dead mouse in your pockets?"

This is an atom: 
"Me feel lat me might git tee hungly some time, and len me have lillee bite to eatee," replied
Hop, looking very innocent.

This is an atom: 
The outlaws grinned at this.

This is an atom: 
They had all heard that Chinamen liked to eat rats, so they were not surprised to hear that
one ate mice.

This is an atom: 
Even Wild smiled at the way Hop was working it.

This is an atom: 
He now believed that the chances of getting free from the outlaws were improving, for Hop would
be apt to manage it in some way.

This is an atom: 
"I'll tell you what you do," said Roche, as Hop proceeded to put the articles back where they
had been taken from. "You get your money at the camp and bring that here, too."

This is an atom: 
Allee light, Misler Outlaw, replied Hop. "You will havee um cigar?"

This is an atom: 
He tendered one and, taking it, the outlaw looked at it suspiciously and then cut off the end
with his bowie knife.

This is an atom: 
Hop lighted one, too, and then he stood still.

This is an atom: 
"Me allee samee forgittee whattee you say," he said, as he looked puzzled.

This is an atom: 
Cap Roche went over it again.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, allee light. Me understand."

This is an atom: 
The cigar he had given the villain was a good one, and he puffed away at it with no little
satisfaction, since it served to soothe his nerves somewhat.

This is an atom: 
Hop took occasion to drop the dead mouse in the pocket of the man who was standing at the side
of Wild to prevent his possible escape, and then he turned to go.

This is an atom: 
But he came back again, and, looking at the villain he had played the trick on he said:

This is an atom: 
"You takee my tanglefoot and allee samee puttee in your pockee; me wantee."

This is an atom: 
As it was Roche who had appropriated the flask, the man shook his head and grinned.

This is an atom: 
"See here!" exclaimed the leader, angrily. "You ought to be satisfied that I didn't take more
than the whisky. You've got your mouse, so go on and do your errand."

This is an atom: 
"Oh!" cried Hop, his face lighting up. "Now me know. You takee um tanglefoot, and lis man takee
my mousee! He allee samee goatee in um pockee."

This is an atom: 
Instinctively the outlaw put his hand in his pocket, and the first thing his fingers came in
contact with was the dead mouse.

This is an atom: 
He uttered a cry and pulled it out.

This is an atom: 
"Hip hi!" yelled Hop, as he ran for the mouth of the cave.

This is an atom: 
But the outlaw was just mad enough to run and catch him before he got to the curtain.

This is an atom: 
"Here," said Hop, "me givee you lis. Allee samee diamond ling inside. Lettee poor Chinee go!"

This is an atom: 
It was one of the oblong, little packages that he handed to the man, and, letting the mouse
drop, he took it and walked back to those in the big cave.

This is an atom: 
But he did not notice that a tiny spark was working its way along what seemed to be a string
on the package.

This is an atom: 
The fact was that it was one of his patent firecrackers that Hop had given him.

This is an atom: 
Just as he joined the rest at the table the thing exploded with a noise like that of a shotgun.

This is an atom: 
"Ow! Murder!" yelled the outlaw, for his hand was burned by the operation.

This is an atom: 
Then he danced about like a wild man, while the prisoners were forced to laugh, in spite of
their situation.

This is an atom: 
Cap Roche was the first to realize what had happened.

This is an atom: 
"Shut up!" he commanded. "He played a joke on you, that's all. Serves you right for fooling
with him. That is the greatest Chinaman I ever saw."

This is an atom: 
The victim went for water to cool his burning hand.

This is an atom: 
"Allee light; me go now," called out Hop, who had been, watching from the front of the cave.
"Me soonee come back with um money to pay um toll, so be."

This is an atom: 
Out he went, and he had not gone more than a dozen yards when he came upon the scout.

This is an atom: 
"Where's Anna an' Eloise?" Charlie demanded.

This is an atom: 
"Outlaws allee samee gottee," was the reply. "Come 'way petty quicken."

This is an atom: 
He almost pulled him around the bend, and then he found Jim and Arietta there.

This is an atom: 
The three had been watching from the top of the cliff, and when they saw the outlaws take Wild
in they did not wait very long there, but came back to the pass.

This is an atom: 
It was their intention to take up a couple of lariats and try and devise a means of getting
Wild away from the villains, but when they found that the girls and the Chinaman were not there,
while the horses were just as they had left them, they did not know what to make of it.

This is an atom: 
It was while the scout was creeping up to the cave, thinking that the outlaws might have caught
those they had left in the pass, that he saw Hop come out.

This is an atom: 
It was surely a morning of surprises, and Charlie was badly puzzled.

This is an atom: 
But when Hop told of the errand he has been sent on he was completely silenced for the time being.

This is an atom: 
When he found the use of his tongue he exclaimed:

This is an atom: 
"Well, that beats anything yet! So ther galoots wants us ter pay money, eh? Well, I reckon
not! We'll jest git Wild an' ther two gals away from 'em without pain' a thing. Hop, you take
my horse an' ride over to ther camp as fast as yer kin. Jest git ther miners together an' tell
'em what's up. Then yer kin git some of ther counterfeit money you've got hid around somewhere
an' come back an' take it ter Roche. While you're talkin' to 'em we'll all creep in an' fix
ther galoots fur good an' all!"

This is an atom: 
"Allee light, Misler Charlie."

This is an atom: 
Hop was not long in mounting the scout's horse, and then he rode swiftly to Big Bonanza.

This is an atom: 
He went to the camp first and, telling Wing enough to make him frightened about it, he got
a roll of counterfeit money from his saddlebags.

This is an atom: 
This he stuffed in his pocket, and then he rode to the saloon.

This is an atom: 
"Misler Hoker," he said; "me wanted allee samee lot of mans to go and fight um outlaws, so
be. Ley allee samee goatee Young Wild West in um cave, and Missy Anna and Missy Eloise, too,
so be."

This is an atom: 
The keeper of the saloon was astounded when he heard this.

This is an atom: 
He questioned the Chinaman and soon came to the conclusion that he was telling the truth.

This is an atom: 
Then he hastily left the saloon and went out and told the miners as fast as he could get to
the places they were working at.

This is an atom: 
Shortly afterward the first of the miners to be notified by Hoker came running into the saloon.

This is an atom: 
Hop had to answer a lot of questions, but he managed to make it plain to the miners what was
wanted of them, so in a few minutes they were marching for the pass.

This is an atom: 
The Chinaman rode on ahead and soon came to the spot where he had left Charlie, Jim and Arietta.

This is an atom: 
But they were not there now, and, thinking that they had ascended the cliff again, he decided
to go on in the cave.

This is an atom: 
He went around to the curtain and found the scout lying close to the cliff near it.

This is an atom: 
Charlie motioned for him to go on in, and, without looking at him any further, Hop lifted the
curtain and obeyed.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XIV.

This is an atom: 
HOW ARIETTA PAID THE TOLL.

This is an atom: 
Arietta and Jim had gone to the top of the cliff again, hoping to catch sight of Wild once
more, while Charlie remained near the mouth of the cave.

This is an atom: 
The scout made up his mind to get inside when Hop came back, and he had managed to creep up
close to the concealed opening.

This is an atom: 
As the Chinaman passed inside he waited for half a minute, and then he took the risk of raising
the curtain a trifle.

This is an atom: 
The coast was clear, so he crawled through.

This is an atom: 
Once on the inside, he moved over to a rocky wall and then listened.

This is an atom: 
He could hear the Chinaman talking in his bland way to the villains.

This is an atom: 
There had been a man watching for Hop's return, but in some way he had neglected to be looking
at the time Charlie crept up, and it was not until he had escorted the Chinaman to the leader
that he went to the curtain to stand guard again.

This is an atom: 
But he did not see the crouching form of the scout, and once he had passed him Charlie began
moving toward the rear of the cave.

This is an atom: 
He soon got to within a few feet of the villains in the cave, and when he peered from behind
a rock and saw his wife and Eloise sitting at the table near Wild; he felt a little easier.

This is an atom: 
Hop was standing before the leader of the band, and all eyes were turned on him.

This is an atom: 
He had been talking in a random sort of way, not seeing fit to make a report just yet.

This is an atom: 
"Stop that!" exclaimed Roche, as he started in to give an account as how smart his uncle in
China was. "Did you get the money from Young Wild West's partners--that's the question?"

This is an atom: 
"Me allee samee git tee bigger pile of money and um bottle of tanglefoot, so be," answered
the Chinaman, quickly getting down to business.

This is an atom: 
"Give me the money!"

This is an atom: 
"You lettee Miss Anna and Missy Eloise go?" Hop went on asking.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, I'll let them go right now."

This is an atom: 
To make good his words he cut the ropes that held them helpless and told the two girls to walk
on out.

This is an atom: 
Surprised at their sudden release, they lost no time in obeying.

This is an atom: 
Hop handed over the roll of counterfeit money.

This is an atom: 
"Now you can go, too," he said, nodding to the Chinaman.

This is an atom: 
"How aboutee Misler Wild?"

This is an atom: 
"Well, we'll keep him a little while longer, I reckon."

This is an atom: 
Anna and Eloise lost no time in getting out of the cave.

This is an atom: 
Just why the villainous leader of the band had seen fit to let them go they did not know.

This is an atom: 
The scout saw them go past him, but he did not offer to attract their attention.

This is an atom: 
He was waiting to get a chance to release Wild.

This is an atom: 
But it was not going to come to him just then, for Cap Roche suddenly called Chuck Snivel and said:

This is an atom: 
"Take Young Wild West out and tie him to the post again. I reckon we can't trust altogether
to that Chinaman. It may be that he has told the miners of Big Bonanza all about this. If he
has we will need the prisoner to make terms with them. There is one thing about it, and that
is that Young Wild West don't go free until I know for a certainty that we will be allowed
a chance to get away."

This is an atom: 
As soon as Hop saw that they were going to take Wild outside he made his way toward the front
of the cave.

This is an atom: 
"Goodby!" he said. "When you finder lat me allee samee keepee my word you let Misler Wild go.
Len you all go 'way, and nobody hurtee you."

This is an atom: 
Hop lost no time in getting outside.

This is an atom: 
He found the girls where the horses were.

This is an atom: 
But Jim and Arietta were nowhere to be seen.

This is an atom: 
"Missy Anna," he said to the scout's wife, "you and Missy Eloise allee samee takee horses and
lide to meet um miners. You tellee allee 'boutee. But makee um stay light here till Misler
Charlie or Misler Jim come."

This is an atom: 
"All right, Hop," Anna answered. "We will do just as you say. But where is Charlie?"

This is an atom: 
"He in um cave."

This is an atom: 
"What!"

This is an atom: 
"He come in light after me, so be. He waitee to git tee lillee chance to git tee Misler Wild
outee."

This is an atom: 
The girls understood.

This is an atom: 
Just then the walking miners from the camp came in sight.

This is an atom: 
There were twenty or more of them, and they were all armed to the teeth.

This is an atom: 
When they saw the girls they broke into a cheer, but a motion from Hop quickly silenced them.

This is an atom: 
"Don't makee no noise," he said. "Misler Wild no git tee outee yet, so be."

This is an atom: 
Then he told them just how things were, and the men agreed to wait with the girls until they
received orders from either Charlie on Jim.

This is an atom: 
Hop now clambered up the cliff to find Arietta and Jim.

This is an atom: 
Once at the top he looked around, but could see nothing of them.

This is an atom: 
He quickly made his way over to the other side and cautiously peered over.

This is an atom: 
The outlaws had just brought Wild out of the cave, and on a ledge about twelve feet above him
were Arietta and Jim, hiding behind a rock.

This is an atom: 
"Young Wild West," said Cap Roche, as the boy was led out to the post, "are you ready to give
your promise that we will not be interfered with?"

This is an atom: 
"I can't give a promise like that until I know for certain that I am to be freed," was the reply.

This is an atom: 
As Wild spoke the words he caught a glimpse of Arietta and Jim on the ledge.

This is an atom: 
But he was so well trained that he did not let the villains know that he had seen anything
out of the ordinary.

This is an atom: 
"Tie him to the post, boys," said Roche. "I reckon we've got to figure this thing out right
before we do much. I'll see if we need any more in the way of toll."

This is an atom: 
He pulled out the roll Hop had given him, and the men, eager to see the money, did not proceed
to tie Wild right away.

This is an atom: 
The moment Roche opened the roll he saw that it was not good money.

This is an atom: 
An oath escaped his lips.

This is an atom: 
"Where is that rascal of a Chinaman?" he demanded. "This isn't money. It is nothing but the
rankest kind of counterfeit bills."

This is an atom: 
It was just then that our hero saw his sweetheart getting ready to do something.

This is an atom: 
At the same moment Hop was hurrying to the edge of the cliff on the other side to tell the
miners to rush into the cave.

This is an atom: 
The critical moment had arrived.

This is an atom: 
The villains had just finished tying Wild to the post when a lariat whizzed through the air
and settled over the head and shoulders of the leader.

This is an atom: 
"Here is the way we are going to pay the toll!" cried Arietta.

This is an atom: 
Up the side of the cliff went the man.

This is an atom: 
The brave girl held a revolver pointed at Snivel, and, in a ringing voice, she added:

This is an atom: 
"Release the prisoner, or your captain will die!"

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XV.

This is an atom: 
CONCLUSION.

This is an atom: 
Cheyenne Charlie was just thinking of making his way out of the cave when a shout rang out
from the opening they had taken Wild through.

This is an atom: 
Out went the men in a hurry, and, hearing Arietta's voice shouting a warning to them, the scout
drew his revolvers, and with one in either hand bounded out after the outlaws.

This is an atom: 
One of the first things he saw was the form of Cap Roche hanging from the ledge.

This is an atom: 
The rope had looped him about the body and pinioned his arms at the same time.

This is an atom: 
But the villain was making a desperate struggle and the rope showed signs of slipping.

This is an atom: 
However, not one of the men dared to shoot at the girl or Jim.

This is an atom: 
Cheyenne Charlie stepped up and walked around behind Wild without being noticed by the excited
and surprised outlaws.

This is an atom: 
A quick slash with his knife and the ropes were severed.

This is an atom: 
Then he slipped a revolver in the boy's hand.

This is an atom: 
Wild coolly stepped from the post.

This is an atom: 
"Up with your hands, you sneaking coyotes!" he cried in a ringing voice. "I reckon ther jig
is up now. Arietta has paid ther toll!"

This is an atom: 
Then Wild calmly reached out and took another revolver from the belt of the nearest man to him.

This is an atom: 
Two of the villains held up their hands, but the rest made a bolt for the cave.

This is an atom: 
Crack!

This is an atom: 
Cheyenne Charlie got at work, as usual, and the foremost one dropped.

This is an atom: 
"I reckon you galoots will have ter have a bigger grave dug when we git through with yer,"
he called out. "That one you've got here ain't half big enough!"

This is an atom: 
Just then Cap Roche slipped the rope, and down he came in a heap.

This is an atom: 
Before he could get upon his feet our hero stood over him.

This is an atom: 
"Surrender!" he cried. "It is the easiest way out of it. If you fight it out there won't be
one man left of you, Roche!"

This is an atom: 
"I'll never surrender!" was the defiant shout. "Go ahead and shoot me, if you want to. I am
going to die fighting."

This is an atom: 
He rolled over and got upon his feet, regardless of the fact that the finger of the young deadshot
was upon the trigger of the revolver that was aimed at him.

This is an atom: 
Roche had lost his revolvers when he tumbled down, but he still hold his knife.

This is an atom: 
Jerking it from the sheath, he prepared to make a rush at the boy, who stood covering him with
a revolver.

This is an atom: 
Just then several shots rang out from inside the cave, following by yells of triumph.

This is an atom: 
Arietta now slid down by means of the lariat Jim had hold of.

This is an atom: 
Then Jim dropped the distance himself.

This is an atom: 
Out of the cave came the miners, dragging the prisoners they had taken with them.

This is an atom: 
Roche turned deathly pale when he saw that it was all up with him.

This is an atom: 
"Young Wild West," he hissed, "I want to kill you before I die myself! I will never be taken
alive, so if you have got the nerve to fight me, come on!"

This is an atom: 
Wild dropped his revolvers into the holsters and took Jim's knife.

This is an atom: 
"I'm after you, Cap!" he exclaimed, a smile playing about his mouth. "If you want to kill me,
come on!"

This is an atom: 
Clash!

This is an atom: 
The knives came together in the air, and then the fight was on.

This is an atom: 
Young Wild West kept slapping him on the face with the flat of his knife blade, and this was
galling to the outlaw.

This is an atom: 
"What are you, a young fiend?" he cried, savagely, as he received a scratch on the neck, which
he knew could have been his finish if the boy had so willed it.

This is an atom: 
"No," answered Wild; "I am simply a boy who has practiced this sort of business a great deal.
Look, out for yourself, Cap! I am going to make you drop that knife!"

This is an atom: 
The words were hardly out of his mouth when the back of Wild's blade struck the villain's wrist.

This is an atom: 
Uttering a cry of pain, Roche dropped his weapon.

This is an atom: 
Then he staggered back and picked up a stone.

This is an atom: 
Crack!

This is an atom: 
One of the miners fired and the man reeled, and, letting go the stone, dropped to the ground, dead.

This is an atom: 
Our hero now went into the cave, for the twelve men who had survived were all tied hard and fast.

This is an atom: 
It was only natural that he should want to look around the cave, and one of the first things
he came across was the paint that had been used to make the signs, or some just like it.

This is an atom: 
A brush was found, and he painted the following across the entire breadth of the curtain:

This is an atom: 
"Closed for Repairs--No More Toll Collected in the Pass!"

This is an atom: 
"I reckon that looks all right, don't it, boys?" he called out to the miners.

This is an atom: 
"You bet!" cried John Sedgwick. "Boys, give three cheers fur Young Wild West!"

This is an atom: 
The cheering echoed through the pass.

This is an atom: 
It was now near noon, but Wild was bent on doing the work he had in view, so he started in.

This is an atom: 
He sent the miners on with the prisoners, and then he painted a couple of signs to take the
places of those at either end of the pass.

This is an atom: 
The signs when finished bore the words:

This is an atom: 
"Short Cut Pass--No danger!"

This is an atom: 
(Signed)   "Young Wild West."

This is an atom: 
"There! I reckon as soon as we have put these up we will call the job complete," he said.

This is an atom: 
Not until they were up did our friends return to their camp.

This is an atom: 
There was a big time in Big Bonanza, as might be supposed.

This is an atom: 
A messenger had been sent over to Silver Bend to spread the news of the capture of the outlaw
band, and, with the prisoners locked in a shanty, the miners danced around it in delight.

This is an atom: 
It was the middle of the afternoon when a crowd came over from Silver Bend, and then the prisoners
were turned over to the Vigilantes who were with them.

This is an atom: 
Everybody was surprised when they heard that Cap Roche was dead, and that he had been the leader
of the outlaws.

This is an atom: 
The next day Young Wild West and his friends left Big Bonanza.

This is an atom: 
They rode through the pass that had been forbidden to travelers unless they paid toll, and
stopped at Silver Bend, for a day and night.

This is an atom: 
They received a big ovation there, and the next morning they set out for Arizona, where our
hero had some business to attend to.

This is an atom: 
They all were willing to allow that it was one of the liveliest mornings they had ever put
in when they went to Forbidden Pass, however.

This is an atom: 
But Arietta had paid the toll, so that was sufficient.

This is an atom: 
THE END.

This is an atom: 
Read "YOUNG WILD WEST AND THE INDIAN TRAITOR; or, THE CHARGE OF THE 'RED' BRIGADE" which will
be the next number (290) of "Wild West Weekly."

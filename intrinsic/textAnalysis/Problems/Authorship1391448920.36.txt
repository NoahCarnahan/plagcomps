NON-PLAGIARIZED ATOMS: 

------------------------------------------------------------
This is an atom: 
We have divided the
little volume into three parts, the first of which gives a short
_resumé_ of the war against Troy and the destruction of that city,
the second the wanderings of Odysseus till his arrival in Ithaca,
the third his arrival and the killing of the wooers.

This is an atom: 
We have no apology
to make in presenting this book to the public as a school-book, since
many people superior to us have shown the need of such books in
school-work.

This is an atom: 
The new public schools, as is well known, have a mission
of the highest importance.

This is an atom: 
They do not aim, as formerly, at absolute
knowledge pounded into the heads of children in a mechanical way.

This is an atom: 
"

The Greek editor had never read the inane rat and cat stories of
American school "readers" when he wrote that.

This is an atom: 
Nearly all of the Greek writings contain an abundance
of practical wisdom and virtue.

This is an atom: 
Their worth is so great that even
the most advanced European nations do not hesitate to introduce them
into their schools.

This is an atom: 
The Germans do this, although their habits and
customs are so different from ours.

This is an atom: 
These books, above all others, afford pleasure to the young,
and the reason for it is clearly set forth by the eminent educator
Herbart:

"'The little boy is grieved when told that he is little.

This is an atom: 
I find the
stories from Homer to be more suitable reading for young children
than the mass of juvenile books, because they contain grand truths.

This is an atom: 
'

"Therefore these stories are held in as high esteem by the German
children as by the Greek.

This is an atom: 
In no other works do children find the grand
and noble traits in human life so faithfully and charmingly depicted
as in Homer.

This is an atom: 
The Homeric poetry, and especially the 'Odyssey,' is
adapted to very young children, not only because it satisfies so well
the needs which lead to mental development, but also for another
reason.

This is an atom: 
As with the people of olden times bravery was considered the
greatest virtue, so with boys of this age and all ages.

This is an atom: 
Strength of
body and a firm will characterize those whom boys choose as their
leaders.

This is an atom: 
Hence the pleasure they derive from the accounts of
celebrated heroes of yore whose bravery, courage, and prudence they
admire.

This is an atom: 
"

The editor further extols the advantages arising from the study of
Homer, it making the youthful students acquainted with the earliest
periods of Greek history, the manners and customs of the people, and
he ends by quoting from Herbart:

"Boys must first get acquainted with the noisy market-place of Ithaca
and then be led to the Athens of Miltiades and Themistokles.

This is an atom: 
"

With equal truth the American can say that the child whose patriotism
is kindled by the Homeric fire will the more gladly respond to the
ideals set forth in the history of a Columbus or a Washington.

This is an atom: 
PART I
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE LIFE OF THE HERO, ODYSSEUS


CHAPTER I
ABOUT TROY AND THE JOURNEY OF PARIS TO GREECE


On the northern shore of Asia Minor there lies a plateau watered by
many small rivers and surrounded on all sides by mountains, only on
the north it slopes gently to the sea.

This is an atom: 
On this plateau, between the
Simois and Scamandros rivers, in the oldest times there stood a very
rich and powerful city, whose name was Troy.

This is an atom: 
It was the capital of
a large and fertile district, known as the Troad.

This is an atom: 
It was said, indeed, that he had fifty sons who were all married and
living in their own homes, which they had built by the king's wish
around the royal palace.

This is an atom: 
He was
a restless youth and not fond of his home, as were the others.

This is an atom: 
He
had set his heart on travelling and seeing strange countries and
cities.

This is an atom: 
King Priam was extremely fond of his large family, and took
pride in having all his children about him, so that at first he was
greatly opposed to the wishes of Paris.

This is an atom: 
But the youth was so persistent and unhappy that the king at last
consented to let him go.

This is an atom: 
Without delay, Paris called together a few
friends with tastes as adventurous as his own.

This is an atom: 
They embarked in a
new ship well provided with all that travellers need, and set sail
for the famous land on the shores of the Ægean Sea, of which they
had heard so many wonderful things, and which was called Hellas.

This is an atom: 
Nearly in the middle of the plain which forms the southern part of
Hellas was the city of Sparta.

This is an atom: 
It was on the river Eurotas, and was
the capital of a large district called Lacedæmon, and it was to this
city that Paris came.

This is an atom: 
Now, there was a mysterious reason for this strange desire of
Paris--his passionate longing to travel.

This is an atom: 
In his early youth, while
he was still minding his herds on the rich pastures of Mount Ida,
he received a visit from the three greatest goddesses of Olympos.

This is an atom: 
Hera, the queen of Heaven and consort of Zeus--Athena, the goddess
of wisdom, and Zeus's favorite daughter--and Aphrodite, the goddess
of love and beauty, had a dispute among themselves.

This is an atom: 
Each thought herself the most beautiful of the three, and they would
have come to high words about it had not Athena proposed that they
should ask the handsomest man in the world to settle the question.

This is an atom: 
Paris, as might have been expected, decided in favor of Aphrodite,
who had promised him that the fairest woman living in the whole world
should be his wife.

This is an atom: 
This promise had to be kept, being given by a
goddess, but it was the source of endless misfortune, for Paris had
a young and lovely wife who was tenderly attached to him, while the
fairest of living women--acknowledged as such by fame in all known
countries--was Queen Helen of Sparta, herself the wife of another
man.

This is an atom: 
Her husband was one of the most renowned heroes of Hellas, King
Menelaos, a son of Atreus and brother of the leader of the Greek chiefs,
Agamemnon, King of Mycenæ.

This is an atom: 
It was Aphrodite, then, who inspired Paris
with an insane desire to forsake his parents, brothers, and wife.

This is an atom: 
It was her secret guidance which led him across the seas and through
the dangers lurking among the hundreds of islands of the Archipelagos
straight to the land of Lacedæmon.

This is an atom: 
This is the central of the three
peninsulas in which the Peloponnesus ends, and might be called the
middle finger of that large hand of which Arcadia is the palm.

This is an atom: 
Paris landed, with all his companions, on the shores of Lacedæmon,
where the people received him kindly and helped him on his journey
to Sparta, where Menelaos and Helen gave him a cordial welcome.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER II
THE FLIGHT OF HELEN


Aphrodite, while leading Paris to the shores of Lacedæmon, had not
forgotten her promise, and in Sparta itself she was at work at its
fulfilment.

This is an atom: 
She inspired Queen Helen with a growing discontent and
restlessness of spirit.

This is an atom: 
Menelaos had not noticed any change in her,
and it was with an utterly unsuspicious mind that he received the
fatal strangers and made them welcome guests in his land and home.

This is an atom: 
More than that, having heard the news from Crete that his presence
there was desirable on account of some urgent business, he did not
hesitate to set sail for that island, in the expectation of finding
Paris and his companions still enjoying the hospitality of his palace
after a short absence.

This is an atom: 
Little did he heed, in his mad desire to call the most
beautiful woman in the world his wife, that she was already the wife
of a hero who had received him as an honored guest in his house, and
that he was about to destroy the peace and honor of his host.

This is an atom: 
As soon as Menelaos heard of the flight of his wife, he hastened back
to Sparta, where he found his palace deserted and his treasure-house
robbed.

This is an atom: 
He set out at once to
see his brother, Agamemnon, to consult with him about what was to
be done.

This is an atom: 
Agamemnon was ruler over Mycenæ, and highly respected in
all Hellas on account of his power and riches.

This is an atom: 
After the two brothers had talked over this grave affair, they
announced to all the leaders in Hellas the great and detestable crime,
and asked them for their assistance.

This is an atom: 
All the king's chiefs of Hellas
lent a willing ear to this demand, for in this breach of hospitality,
committed against one of them, each felt himself personally aggrieved
and bound to help in the punishment of what, in those times, was
considered the most unpardonable of all crimes.

This is an atom: 
This was Odysseus of Ithaca, who could well consider himself at the
time the happiest of mortals, for he had lately married Penelope,
one of the fairest and most virtuous maidens of Greece.

This is an atom: 
He had an
infant son of great beauty and promise, and he owned much land and
countless herds of cattle, sheep, and swine.

This is an atom: 
Added to that, all the
petty nobles of the island acknowledged him as their chief.

This is an atom: 
But a soothsayer, or seer, had greatly disturbed him by informing
him that if he went to a great war he would be kept away from his
home for the space of twenty years, and even then return to it in
the guise of a beggar, after having suffered wrecks, captivity,
endless wanderings, and loss of comrades.

This is an atom: 
No one could doubt that Odysseus was brave, but no one could blame
him for wishing to be excused from taking part in the war against
Troy.

This is an atom: 
Menelaos and his brother, however, would accept no excuse from
him, as he was the wisest and craftiest of all the leaders, and when
Odysseus finally consented to join them he set about arming and
directing the young Greek warriors with all his heart and soul.

This is an atom: 
There was another young prince whom it was absolutely necessary to
secure, for a much venerated oracle had given it as a decree of the
gods that Troy could never be taken without his help.

This is an atom: 
This was Achilles,
son of Peleus, king of the Myrmidons in Thessaly, and of the beauteous
ocean nymph, Thetis.

This is an atom: 
Notwithstanding his extreme youth, his father
would not disappoint the whole country, and he let him go with those
who came for him.

This is an atom: 
But he sent along with him his adopted son, Patroklos,
who was several years older, and to whom the boy was passionately
attached, and also his oldest and most trusted servant, Phoenix.

This is an atom: 
These
two, the old man and the youth, he charged, as they hoped for the
mercy of Zeus, to keep watchful guard over Achilles, whose exceedingly
impetuous and reckless temper exposed him to many dangers which might
be averted by a sensible and loving word spoken in time.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: THE SILVER-FOOTED THETIS RISING FROM THE WAVES]

The Greeks took counsel together, and it was resolved that Menelaos
should go in person to Troy and demand back his wife, Helen, as well
as his treasure and a suitable apology for the wrong done to him and
to all Hellas.

This is an atom: 
The king at once called his people together to deliberate upon the
matter, and the two Greek kings bravely denounced the mean act of
Paris.

This is an atom: 
But the Trojans, stirred up by that youth, abused the
ambassadors and drove them out of their city.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER III
THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY


The kings and chieftains of Hellas, having heard that Odysseus and
Menelaos had been driven out of Troy, hastened to call together their
fleets and armies at Aulis, a city of Boeotia on a ridge of rock running
out into the sea between two little bays, each of which was a harbor
for many ships.

This is an atom: 
A hundred thousand men and a thousand ships were
gathered there under the leadership of the celebrated and heroic
chiefs.

This is an atom: 
The commander-in-chief of the whole army was Agamemnon.

This is an atom: 
Among the renowned leaders were Menelaos, the sagacious Odysseus,
Ajax, and many others.

This is an atom: 
Just as they were offering a sacrifice to the
gods, in order to start out to the war with their good will, a great
miracle happened.

This is an atom: 
A fearful snake crept from under the altar and
climbed a tree in which there was a sparrow's nest nearly hidden by
the leaves.

This is an atom: 
The snake devoured the fluttering little birds,
around which the mother circled as if overcome by grief.

This is an atom: 
Then the snake darted at the mother-bird and swallowed it, when Zeus
changed the reptile into a stone.

This is an atom: 
The Greeks wondered at the sight,
but the soothsayer, Calchas, said to them: "Why do ye wonder at this?

This is an atom: 
The all-powerful Zeus has sent us this sign because our deeds shall
live forever in the minds of men.

This is an atom: 
Just as the snake has devoured the
eight little sparrows and their mother, so shall the war swallow up
the nine coming years, and in the tenth we shall overcome Troy.

This is an atom: 
"

The ships of the Greeks lay in the bays of Aulis while the warriors
waited impatiently to set sail.

This is an atom: 
But the winds were contrary; they
would not blow, and the boats waited there year after year; for a
sacred hind had been slain by Agamemnon, one that belonged to the
goddess Artemis, and it was ordered by that goddess that no wind should
arise to take them on toward Troy until her wrath had been appeased.

This is an atom: 
So Agamemnon went to Calchas, the seer, and asked his advice,
whereupon the old prophet told him to send for his lovely young
daughter, Iphigeneia, and offer her up on the altar as the only
acceptable sacrifice to Artemis.

This is an atom: 
When he had placed her upon the altar
and the priest was raising his knife, the goddess took pity on
Agamemnon and carried the girl away in a cloud, leaving a fine white
doe instead.

This is an atom: 
How they fought with the Trojans, how many of the heroes outlived
the struggle, and how many fell in the battle, all this we can learn
from an old book called the "Iliad.

This is an atom: 
" We shall select from it only
those things which refer to our hero, Odysseus; and to complete the
history of that hero we shall go to another book, called the "Odyssey.

This is an atom: 
"

Both of these books are the work of the great poet Homer, who lived
many years after the war with Troy.

This is an atom: 
That we may understand better
what happened later on, we must give a short account of the fall of
Troy and of the return of Menelaos and Agamemnon to their own country.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER IV
THE FALL OF TROY


The war lasted nine years, and in the tenth the Greeks conquered Troy,
not in battle, but by means of a trick which had come into the mind
of Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
When he
had done this he advised all the other Greeks to depart without leaving
anything behind them, and so lead the Trojans to believe that they
had given up the fight and gone home.

This is an atom: 
So the Greeks burned their tents and put off to sea, while the Trojans
from their walls watched them with great joy, thinking themselves
well rid of an enemy.

This is an atom: 
When the last ship had gone, the Trojans threw
open the gates of their city and rushed down into the plain where
the Greeks had had their camp, to see how the place looked.

This is an atom: 
There they found the wooden horse, and one of the Greeks tied to a
tree, who told them he was left there as a punishment, and that the
wooden horse was an offering to the gods.

This is an atom: 
The Trojans made up their
minds to carry it into their city and give it the best place on their
highest hill.

This is an atom: 
Then Laocoön, a priest of Apollo, stepped forth, and said to them:
"Unhappy people!

This is an atom: 
Do ye think the enemy
gone?

This is an atom: 
Do ye know Odysseus so little?

This is an atom: 
There are Greek warriors hidden
in this horse, or else some other mischief is lurking there.

This is an atom: 
Fear
the Greeks even when they bring gifts.

This is an atom: 
"

With these words, he thrust his spear into the flank of the horse,
and the arms of the hidden enemy clashed with a loud noise.

This is an atom: 
Just then
two snakes of great size, sent by Athena, rose from the sea, and sprang
upon Laocoön and his two sons, and, coiling around them, bit them
to death.

This is an atom: 
The Trojans, in great fear at the sight, took this as a
sign from the gods that the horse was sacred and that they must protect
it, and they moved it at once into their city, breaking down a part
of their wall to get it in.

This is an atom: 
Having done this, they gave themselves up to feasting and making merry,
without the slightest thought that any evil was in store for them.

This is an atom: 
But when night had come, and all were in a deep sleep, the ships of
the Greeks, which had been hiding all the while behind a neighboring
island, came back.

This is an atom: 
The warriors who were concealed in the wooden horse
sprang out and rushing wildly through the city, slew the Trojans right
and left without mercy.

This is an atom: 
From all sides came wailings and groans, and
the flames of the burning city rose up to the sky.

This is an atom: 
Troy fell never to rise again, and the women and children
were led off to become slaves to their conquerors.

This is an atom: 
Thus was destroyed in one night the great and glorious city of Troy,
all on account of the crime which Paris had committed against the
laws of hospitality.

This is an atom: 
The trials of the Greeks were not yet at an end.

This is an atom: 
But Zeus prepared a sad fate for them, because Ajax had
violently dragged Cassandra, the beautiful daughter of Priam, from
the altar of Athena and had made her his slave.

This is an atom: 
Thus many of the leaders
perished in the sea far from home, and some were cast on foreign shores
to die.

This is an atom: 
Menelaos was thrown by wind and waves on the island of Crete, and
he lost many of the ships on the cliffs.

This is an atom: 
Thence he strayed to the
island of Cyprus, noted for its mines; and he roved through other
lands until he came to Egypt, where he wandered about for eight years,
when he returned to Sparta, taking Helen with him.

This is an atom: 
But the saddest fate of all overtook Agamemnon, who met his death
in his own house at the hands of his wife and brother.

This is an atom: 
Agamemnon, without any accident at sea, reached his native land.

This is an atom: 
Full
of gratitude, he kissed the earth and wept tears of joy at the thought
of meeting his wife and son.

This is an atom: 
He entered his home with a glad heart, and his faithless wife came
to meet him, but she had prepared a hot bath for him, and there he
met his death, entangled in a net which she threw over him, for she
had not forgotten the loss of her beautiful daughter, Iphigeneia,
whom she believed to have been offered up as a sacrifice on the altar
of Artemis.

This is an atom: 
She was assisted in this dreadful deed by her husband's brother, who
became ruler over the land, holding sway eight years, when Orestes,
the son of Agamemnon, slew him and regained the kingdom.

This is an atom: 
And now we come to the return of Odysseus, the wisest of the Greeks,
who wandered to the remotest part of the earth and learned the customs
of many people, and who suffered terrible things by land and sea.

This is an atom: 
PART II
THE RETURN OF ODYSSEUS TO HIS OWN COUNTRY


CHAPTER V
ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO


All the Greeks who had escaped from the destruction of Troy and had
been spared the terrors of the sea returned to their homes.

This is an atom: 
Each of the gods save one, Poseidon, god of the sea, wished
to help him to find the way home.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus had brought Poseidon's
wrath upon himself through inflicting a terrible injury upon the
favorite son of that deity, and for that reason the wrath of the god
fell on him and he was wrecked.

This is an atom: 
One day all the other gods had assembled
in the hall of Zeus, on Mount Olympos, when Athena, the favorite
daughter of Zeus and firm friend of Odysseus, knowing that her father
in his heart was well-disposed toward the hero, began to plead for
him in a way to excite greater pity still.

This is an atom: 
"O my father, thou great king among the gods," she said, "my heart
is troubled on account of the wise Odysseus, who lingers on an island,
far away from home, and suffers greatly; for a nymph lives on the
island, the daughter of great Atlas, and with sweet words she strives
to make Odysseus forget his native land.

This is an atom: 
But he bewails his fate and
is full of sorrow, his only wish being to have a glimpse of the smoke
of his beloved country.

This is an atom: 
"

Zeus thereupon ordered Hermes to depart at once for the island and
tell the nymph to send Odysseus to his home without delay.

This is an atom: 
He bound his winged sandals to his feet, and, taking
his golden wand in his hand, flew like a meteor over land and sea
till he reached the island where the nymph Calypso made her abode.

This is an atom: 
All about the grotto there was a grove of cypress-trees in which birds
of gay colors were sporting and springs of pure water bubbling, and
the fragrance of strange flowers filled the air.

This is an atom: 
It was bright with a blazing
fire on a spacious hearth, and fragrant with the odor of burning cedar
and cypress.

This is an atom: 
She bade him sit down
on a throne dazzling with jewels, and, placing a table before him
laden with nectar and ambrosia, invited him to eat and drink.

This is an atom: 
After
he had finished his repast, Hermes told her that Zeus had sent him
to her with the command that she should send Odysseus without delay
to his native land.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus in the meantime sat by the shore mourning and gazing out
upon the sea.

This is an atom: 
Calypso found him there, sitting alone, weeping and
longing for his home.

This is an atom: 
She stood by him and said: "Odysseus, my unhappy
friend, do not waste thy life any longer in sorrow.

This is an atom: 
I will put
bread and water and delicate wine on board; and I will clothe thee
in comfortable garments, and send a favorable wind that thou mayest
safely reach thy native land.

This is an atom: 
"

Thus spoke the lovely goddess, but Odysseus could hardly believe her,
and said: "I fear, O goddess, that thou hast some other thought in
thy mind, and that thou dost not wish to send me home when thou biddest
me sail over this stormy and dangerous sea.

This is an atom: 
I shall never go on to
the raft against thy wish, and thou must swear the great oath of the
gods that no harm shall come to me.

This is an atom: 
"

The goddess smiled at these words, and, taking the hero by the hand,
rejoined: "Thou art a wise man, and thy answer is well made.

This is an atom: 
I will
pledge thee a solemn oath, by the heavens and the earth, and the waters
of the Styx, that I have no plan of evil against thee.

This is an atom: 
And I advise
thee to do as I have instructed thee, to be ready for any crisis.

This is an atom: 
"

Speaking thus, the goddess went into the grotto and Odysseus followed
her.

This is an atom: 
When he had come into the spacious hall, he sat down on his throne
and the nymph brought him rich food and wine.

This is an atom: 
Then she took a seat
opposite him, and her attendants brought her ambrosia and nectar,
which she would gladly have shared with Odysseus, that he, too, might
become an immortal.

This is an atom: 
When the repast was over, Calypso narrated to him all the trials he
would have to undergo before he could reach his native land.

This is an atom: 
While
she was relating these things the sun sank down, and darkness came
upon the island, and all who had their abode in the grotto sought
rest and slumber.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VI
ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND


At daybreak the goddess gave Odysseus a large axe and a sharp adze,
and led him to the heights of the island, where the largest trees
grew.

This is an atom: 
He went to work at once and cut down twenty trees, which he
hewed into proper shape, and then tied them together with ropes which
he himself made of bark.

This is an atom: 
In this way he built a raft which was very large and strong enough
to stand the onset of the waves.

This is an atom: 
He wove a railing of willow and fitted
it around the sides of the raft, to protect himself against the dashing
waves; and he raised a strong mast with sails shaped to it, and tightly
bound by cords and ropes.

This is an atom: 
He filled the crevices of the raft with
wax and pitch and attached a rudder.

This is an atom: 
At the end of the fourth day his work was all done, and his little
ship was ready to be launched.

This is an atom: 
On the fifth day the beautiful goddess
prepared the hero a bath and gave him new garments fragrant with
perfumes.

This is an atom: 
She went down to the boat with him and put on board a skin
of dark-red wine, a larger one full of water, and a bag of dainty
food.

This is an atom: 
Then she bade Odysseus a kind farewell, and sent a gentle and
friendly wind to waft him over the waves.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus was wild with joy at the thought that he was really on his
way home once more.

This is an atom: 
He spread his sails to catch the breeze and took
his seat at the helm, steering the vessel with great skill.

This is an atom: 
He did
not dare to take any sleep, for he had to watch the sky and stars
constantly and use them as guides on his course.

This is an atom: 
He raised up his head and said to himself:
"Alas!

This is an atom: 
the gods have strangely changed their minds about Odysseus
during my absence in Africa.

This is an atom: 
in a little while he will be
in the land of the Phæacians, where he will find an end to his troubles.

This is an atom: 
"

Speaking thus, Poseidon called the clouds together, and seizing his
trident he stirred up the sea; then he set loose all the winds until
there was a general hurricane, and he wrapped heaven and earth in
the thick darkness of night.

This is an atom: 
The mighty waves dashed over the raft, and Odysseus sank on his knees
and trembled.

This is an atom: 
With a deep groan he said: "Ah me, unhappy!

This is an atom: 
I fear that the warning of the goddess was too
true, and that I shall be for a long time cast about on the waves
before I reach home.

This is an atom: 
Happy the Greeks who fell before Troy, fighting for their
country!

This is an atom: 
Would that I, too, had met death the day when the Trojans
hurled their spears at me as they strove to take the body of Achilles.

This is an atom: 
If I had died then, the Greeks would have buried me with great honors.

This is an atom: 
"

As he spoke a huge wave struck the raft with such terrible force that
it whirled it around and overturned it.

This is an atom: 
Although he was in such a desperate plight, his mind was on
the raft.

This is an atom: 
Then Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, saw him
and took pity on him.

This is an atom: 
She took the form of a bird, and, perching on
his raft, she said to him: "O, luckless man!

This is an atom: 
Fear nothing, however; he cannot take thy life.

This is an atom: 
Lay aside thy clothes, leave
the raft to the mercy of the winds and waves, and swim to the land.

This is an atom: 
As soon as thou hast reached the land, take it off
and throw it back into the sea.

This is an atom: 
Then Odysseus at once got astride of the
swimming timber.

This is an atom: 
He bound the veil around his breast and bravely
plunged into the boiling waters.

This is an atom: 
Poseidon saw him, and shaking his head he said: "I verily believe
thou wilt come out alive from the sea.

This is an atom: 
But the sea has had thee long
enough, so that thou wilt know its power hereafter and fear it.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VII
ODYSSEUS IS SAVED ON THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA


Athena, the daughter of Zeus, seeing Odysseus struggling through the
waves, pitied him, and bade the winds become quiet.

This is an atom: 
Two days and two
nights Odysseus floated about, but on the third the wind calmed down
and the sea became smooth.

This is an atom: 
In a short time he found himself near land once more.

This is an atom: 
But the shore
was wild and full of sharp rocks and high cliffs.

This is an atom: 
He could see no
place on which to set foot, and he grew downhearted.

This is an atom: 
His knees gave
way, and, groaning deeply, he cried out: "O, luckless one!

This is an atom: 
In vain
have I braved the dangers of the sea to escape death.

This is an atom: 
Now all hope
has abandoned me, since there is no way for me to get out of the water.

This is an atom: 
I fear that when I try to approach the land the waves will throw me
against the cliffs, and should I try to find a safe landing-place
by swimming, the surf may carry me back into the wild sea, where some
sea-monster will swallow me up.

This is an atom: 
"

While he pondered over these things a huge wave cast him on the foamy
shore.

This is an atom: 
His bones were nearly broken, and he lay exhausted until the
wave returned, when he was hurled again with great force back into
the sea.

This is an atom: 
Now the unfortunate wanderer took to swimming as his last
resort, and reached the mouth of a river, where he was able to land.

This is an atom: 
When
his senses returned he rose and untied the veil that Ino had given
him and cast it back into the sea.

This is an atom: 
Then he knelt down and kissed the
earth, and moved to a sheltered spot where a wild and a tame olive-tree
were standing close together, whose branches had mingled with one
another, and there he found a safe hiding-place.

This is an atom: 
Then the godlike Odysseus lay down on a bed of dry leaves, covering
himself up as one does an ember, lest it should go out.

This is an atom: 
Athena came
and poured sweet sleep over his eyes, that he might find quiet rest
after all his toils.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VIII
NAUSICAÄ IS SENT TO THE RIVER BY ATHENA


While Odysseus lay in a deep sleep, the goddess Athena went to the
royal dwelling of the king of the Phæacians, Alkinoös, in order to
hasten the return of Odysseus to his native land.

This is an atom: 
She entered the
house, where she found Nausicaä, the king's daughter, sleeping in
her beautiful chamber.

This is an atom: 
Athena came as softly as a breath of air, and caused the maiden to
dream that her marriage-day was near and that it was her duty to arise
and hasten to the place by the river where they washed their clothing.

This is an atom: 
Thy beautiful robes lie neglected and thy
wedding-day is at hand, on which thou surely shouldst wear garments
of dazzling whiteness, and thou shouldst give such garments to those
maidens who lead thee forth to thy bridegroom.

This is an atom: 
Therefore, as soon
as day breaks thou must ask thy father to give thee a pair of mules,
and we will hasten to the washing-place down by the river.

This is an atom: 
"

At the first dawn of day Nausicaä went in haste to her father and
mother to tell them of her dream.

This is an atom: 
Her mother sat with her maidens spinning, and the king stood
on the threshold, just going forth to meet his chiefs in council.

This is an atom: 
The princess approached her father and said: "Dearest father, I pray
that thou wilt give me two mules and a wagon, that I may go with my
maids to the river and take all the clothes that need washing, for
it becomes the king and his sons to wear clean garments when they
go to the council of the chiefs.

This is an atom: 
Thou hast five sons, three of whom
are youths not wedded, and they should be provided with fresh robes;
they will need them in the dance.

This is an atom: 
"

The king smiled, for he saw what was in her mind, and he ordered the
mules.

This is an atom: 
Then his beautiful daughter brought from the linen-room the
soiled garments and put them on the wagon, while the queen prepared
a goodly lunch of cold meat and bread and a skin of sweet wine.

This is an atom: 
Nausicaä further received from her mother a bottle of fragrant oil
with which to anoint herself after the washing.

This is an atom: 
Then she mounted the
wagon, seized the whip and reins, and drove out of the city, the
maidens of her train following her on foot.

This is an atom: 
When they came to the place where the river was flowing bright and
clear, they unhitched the mules and let them browse along the bank.

This is an atom: 
Then they took their garments down from the wagon and tossed them
into the marble vats which they had filled with the limpid water of
the stream.

This is an atom: 
When they had washed them clean they spread them on the
white pebbles to dry.

This is an atom: 
She looked as tall and royal among her maids
as did Artemis, the daughter of Zeus, among her nymphs.

This is an atom: 
When it was time to go home they put the clean garments upon the wagon
and harnessed up the mules.

This is an atom: 
Just as they started, Nausicaä once more
threw the ball to one of the maidens, who failed to catch it.

This is an atom: 
The
ball rebounded from the rocks and fell into the river, at which the
girls raised such a shout that Odysseus, who was sleeping close by,
awoke.

This is an atom: 
He opened his eyes and sat up, saying to himself: "Woe is me!

This is an atom: 
Are they wild and inhospitable,
or friendly to the stranger and god-fearing?

This is an atom: 
"

So Odysseus clothed himself as best he could, by winding slender
branches covered with leaves about him, and left the thicket where
he was hidden.

This is an atom: 
When the girls saw him they shrieked and scattered
in every direction.

This is an atom: 
Nausicaä alone stood her ground, for Athena gave
her courage.

This is an atom: 
When Odysseus saw her he wondered which would be the
better, to throw himself at the feet of the maiden and beg her to
give him some clothes and to show him the way to the city, or to speak
to her with more formality.

This is an atom: 
It seemed better to him to remain at a distance, and so he addressed
her gently, saying: "O queen, I know not whether thou art a goddess
or a woman.

This is an atom: 
If thou art a goddess, I should take thee to be Artemis,
because thou art so tall and graceful.

This is an atom: 
Greatly must they rejoice
when they see their beautiful child in the choral dance.

This is an atom: 
But he will
be the happiest who shall win thee for a bride.

This is an atom: 
"I once saw a young palm-tree growing up beside Apollo's altar in
the island of Delos.

This is an atom: 
It was the most beautiful tree the earth ever
produced, and I gazed upon it with wonder and reverence.

This is an atom: 
So am I amazed
at thy beauty, and I fear to approach thee and throw myself as a
suppliant at thy feet, although I am in sore distress, for great
misfortunes have befallen me.

This is an atom: 
"It was only last night that I escaped from the sea.

This is an atom: 
On my way from
Calypso's isle I was driven about for twenty days by the angry waves
in a violent storm.

This is an atom: 
Now some god has cast me on this shore to make
me undergo new trials, for I do not believe my sufferings have come
to an end.

This is an atom: 
Have pity on me, O queen, because thou art the first human
being I have met after so many misfortunes.

This is an atom: 
Show me thy city, I pray,
and give me an old robe to wear, no matter how coarse and poor, and
may the gods bestow all blessings upon thee.

This is an atom: 
"

Nausicaä looked at Odysseus in pity and answered: "Stranger, thou
dost not seem to me to be a man of mean birth or breeding, and thou
art surely in distress.

This is an atom: 
But it is Zeus who distributes gifts to mortals,
both the good and the evil things of life, and thou must submit to
his will with patience.

This is an atom: 
"Since thou hast come into our land devoid of all things, even garments,
and art helpless, I will give thee clothing and tell thee the way
to the city.

This is an atom: 
And I will tell thee about the people living in it, for
I am the daughter of the king, Alkinoös, who reigns over this island.

This is an atom: 
"
When Nausicaä had spoken thus to Odysseus, she turned to her maids
and commanded them not to flee from the wanderer, but to bring him
food and drink, since Zeus sent the poor and the stranger to be cared
for.

This is an atom: 
And she told them to lead him to some lonely spot by the side of the
river, where he might bathe at his ease.

This is an atom: 
So the maids came back and
led the hero to a sheltered place and laid a cloak and tunic on the
sand, and the bottle of oil which the queen had given Nausicaä, that
Odysseus might anoint and clothe himself after his bath; then they
ran back to the princess.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus bathed in the fresh water of the river and washed the salt
sea-foam from his hair, and when the bath was over he put on the robes
that Nausicaä had sent.

This is an atom: 
As he walked along the beach to rejoin the maidens, they admired his
noble and kingly bearing, and Nausicaä said to her maids: "Surely
this man does not come among our godlike brothers against the will
of the gods.

This is an atom: 
I thought him rough and homely, but now he seems like
one of the immortals.

This is an atom: 
Make haste to give him food and wine, for he has fasted a
long time.

This is an atom: 
"

The maids hastened to obey.

This is an atom: 
They looked over what was left of the
abundant lunch and bade Odysseus eat and drink, which he was glad
to do.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER IX
ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT THE PALACE OF ALKINOÖS


After Nausicaä had mounted to her seat on the cart, she said to
Odysseus: "Get ready now, stranger, and we will lead thee to my
father's palace, where thou wilt meet the chiefs of the Phæacians.

This is an atom: 
If thou art wise, take well to heart what I shall say to thee.

This is an atom: 
As
long as we are at a good distance from the city there is no harm in
going along with us.

This is an atom: 
"But when we come near to the town thou must go more slowly and tarry
behind a little, till we have reached my father's hall, because I
dread the gossip of the baser sort of people whom we may meet.

This is an atom: 
"Enter at once and find my mother and sue to her for protection and
help, that thou mayest reach thy native land and thy dear ones again.

This is an atom: 
"

Having spoken these words, Nausicaä touched the mules with her long
whip and they quickly left the river, wending their way toward the
city.

This is an atom: 
They reached it at sunset, but Odysseus sat down in the sacred
grove of Athena, outside of the city to wait, and prayed to the goddess
that he might receive pity from the people of Phæacia.

This is an atom: 
While he prayed, the damsels went on and soon reached the king's palace.

This is an atom: 
Nausicaä's brothers came out and welcomed them, and unhitched the
mules.

This is an atom: 
When Odysseus had given them time to get home, he arose and
found his way to the town.

This is an atom: 
He had hardly entered it when Athena, in
the form of a young girl carrying a pitcher of water, met him.

This is an atom: 
"My daughter," Odysseus said to her, "canst thou show me the way to
the king's palace?

This is an atom: 
"
Athena answered him: "With pleasure, stranger; the king is our
neighbor.

This is an atom: 
But on the way
do not greet anyone or ask questions, for the people here are not
fond of those who come from other lands.

This is an atom: 
She threw a veil of darkness over the hero to hide him from rude gazers.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus beheld the beautiful port with astonishment--the large
ships, the great market-place, and the high walls of the city.

This is an atom: 
When they reached the palace, the girl stopped and said: "This is
the house of the king.

This is an atom: 
Go in without any fear, for they love brave
men, even when they come from afar.

This is an atom: 
"She is greatly honored by the king, and all the people treat her
as if she were a goddess, on account of her gentleness and virtue.

This is an atom: 
In case the queen looks upon thee with favor, thou mayest be sure
of safely reaching home.

This is an atom: 
"

Having spoken these words, the goddess took a friendly leave of the
hero, and he entered the outer hall of Alkinoös, where he was
bewildered by the splendor.

This is an atom: 
The walls were of brass, the doors of
gold, and the thresholds and lintels of pure silver.

This is an atom: 
On each side
of the main entrance gold and silver dogs stood guard.

This is an atom: 
They were
endowed with life and were immortal, the work and gift of the divine
Hephæstus.

This is an atom: 
They
were covered with costly mats, and the Phæacian leaders were wont
to sit there and enjoy themselves.

This is an atom: 
Golden statues of boys with lighted
torches in their hands stood on beautiful pedestals and spread light
over the merry banquets.

This is an atom: 
Some of them were grinding corn in the mill.

This is an atom: 
Some spent their time
in spinning and weaving, for as the men were renowned sailors, the
women also were famous for making fine cloth.

This is an atom: 
In the orchard there was a great variety of fruit-trees--pear,
apple, pomegranate, olive, and fig.

This is an atom: 
The trees were never bare of fruit,
either in summer or in winter, for an ever-blowing west wind created
such a mild climate that the trees were constantly blooming and
ripening their fruit.

This is an atom: 
There was to be seen a tree full of blossoms, while another bent down
under the load of ripe fruit.

This is an atom: 
Thus it was with the grape-vines in
the vineyard close to the orchard.

This is an atom: 
Such were the gifts
Alkinoös had received from the gods.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER X
ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS


After Odysseus had contemplated these wonders to his heart's content,
he entered the main hall.

This is an atom: 
There he found the leaders of the Phæacians
bringing offerings of wine to Hermes, as the hour of sleep had arrived,
and this was always their last ceremony before seeking slumber.

This is an atom: 
No
one saw Odysseus as he crossed the spacious room and came close to
the king and queen, for he was still concealed in the thick mist which
Athena had thrown round him.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly the cloud vanished, and Odysseus
threw himself at the feet of Aretè, and raised his voice in
supplication.

This is an atom: 
"Aretè," he prayed, "I have come to thy husband and to thy feet through
many hardships and sorrows.

This is an atom: 
For many years I have been a wanderer from home and all I love.

This is an atom: 
I beg that thou wilt give me a guide and send me to my own land.

This is an atom: 
"

When Odysseus had spoken these words he sat down amidst the ashes,
close to the fire, and all the guests grew silent and looked at him
with wonder.

This is an atom: 
Then the oldest of the chiefs arose and said: "Alkinoös,
this is not a royal seat for a stranger, among the cinders of the
hearth.

This is an atom: 
I pray thee, raise him up and place him on a throne, and order
the heralds to fill a cup with wine, that we may pour a libation to
Zeus, the protector of suppliants, and bid the guest welcome to our
good cheer.

This is an atom: 
He led him to a
splendid throne but little lower than his own, while the herald placed
a table before him loaded with dainty food.

This is an atom: 
When Odysseus had eaten
and drunk, the attendants filled the cups to pour libations in honor
of Zeus, and Alkinoös said to them: "Listen, ye leaders and chiefs
of the Phæacians.

This is an atom: 
But if we should find that
he is a god instead of a mortal, we will do what seems best, for the
gods do sometimes visit us in human shape.

This is an atom: 
"

Then said Odysseus: "Nay, Alkinoös, I am not a god, nor like the gods
in form or looks.

This is an atom: 
I am only a wanderer, and I could tell of fearful
sorrows; and I would willingly die if I could only see my home once
more.

This is an atom: 
"

The guests all greeted Odysseus with approving words, and promised
to aid him.

This is an atom: 
As they
conversed, the queen noticed the garments of Odysseus, because she
had woven them herself, and she said to him: "Stranger, who art thou,
and from what land?

This is an atom: 
Didst thou not say thou hadst come here after
many wanderings and voyages on the stormy sea?

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus answered her: "It would not be easy, gracious queen, to tell
about all my hardships and sufferings.

This is an atom: 
I was shipwrecked long since, and thrown upon an island far out in
the sea, where Calypso, the daughter of Atlas, lives.

This is an atom: 
She cared for
me most kindly, and would have made me, like herself, an immortal,
but I chose instead the hope of seeing my own native land.

This is an atom: 
I built a raft, which she stored with food,
and she sent a pleasant breeze to carry me across the waters.

This is an atom: 
But
Poseidon stirred the winds and waves against me, and I was thrown
upon the shores of this island, near the lavers, where thy daughter
and her maids went to wash the household linen.

This is an atom: 
There the princess
found me, and supplied me with food and the garments I have on.

This is an atom: 
" "Do not blame her, I entreat," replied
Odysseus, "for she bade me come with her maids, but I lingered in
a grove to offer a prayer to Athena.

This is an atom: 
" When Alkinoös had heard this
tale from Odysseus, he promised once more to give him a ship and
sailors to escort him home.

This is an atom: 
Meanwhile the queen bade her servants prepare a bed for the hero out
on the portico, and they covered a couch with shaggy rugs and purple
tapestries, where he could rest.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus rose early the next morning and went with Alkinoös to the
market-place, close to the sea, where all the Phæacians had assembled.

This is an atom: 
The people gazed with admiration at their stranger-guest, for Athena
lent him greater dignity and beauty, and she went among the crowds,
moving their hearts to sympathy with him.

This is an atom: 
Let us fit out a ship for him quickly and launch
it, and give him fifty-two young men from among our best sailors,
who shall get everything ready for the long journey.

This is an atom: 
"While they are doing this the stranger shall come to my halls with
the chiefs and princes, where we will make a great banquet.

This is an atom: 
Summon
also the bard, Demodokos, that he may enliven the festival with his
harp and songs.

This is an atom: 
"

Having spoken, Alkinoös rose and led his guest back to the palace,
the princes following him.

This is an atom: 
Fifty-two youths were soon chosen from
among the best seamen, and they launched a ship speedily and went
up to the royal palace.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XI
THE BANQUET IN HONOR OF ODYSSEUS


Alkinoös now ordered a sumptuous feast in honor of his guest.

This is an atom: 
When
the table was spread, the herald who had gone for Demodokos came in
leading the bard, who was blind.

This is an atom: 
The gods had deprived him of sight,
but had bestowed upon him the gift of song.

This is an atom: 
They gave him a seat on
a silver throne, amid the guests, and hung his harp against a lofty
pillar, close above his head, where he could easily reach it.

This is an atom: 
When all had eaten and drunk as much as they desired, Demodokos took
his lyre and began to sing about the heroes of Troy.

This is an atom: 
It was a song
whose fame had reached over the whole world, the story of a friendly
strife between Achilles and Odysseus before Troy, in which Achilles
held that Troy would fall by force, but Odysseus maintained that it
would come to an end through the cunning of a few brave Greeks.

This is an atom: 
All the guests enjoyed listening to the thrilling song, but Odysseus
was deeply touched, and tears fell from his eyes.

This is an atom: 
He brushed them
away stealthily, so that no one should observe them, and drew a large
purple veil over his face until the song was finished, when he put
it away and took a goblet of wine, which he poured out on the ground
as a libation to the gods.

This is an atom: 
Alkinoös noticed that the song of Demodokos moved Odysseus to tears,
and thought it might be well to stay the music awhile and begin the
games, that the stranger might witness the athletic skill of the
Phæacians.

This is an atom: 
All the princes instantly arose and walked down to the
market-place, the king leading and the people following.

This is an atom: 
When the chiefs had taken their seats a great number of young men
hastened forward to begin the games.

This is an atom: 
Others strove with
all their might in wrestling-matches, while some threw the quoit or
played at boxing and leaping.

This is an atom: 
Cowley, among the first members of the
Royal Society then founded; but he was excluded from the favour of
the king.

This is an atom: 
A noble lord replied
to Cowley's Ode, in praise of Brutus, with an Ode against that
Rebel.

This is an atom: 
Cowley's old friend, Lord Jermyn, now made Earl of St.

This is an atom: 
Alban's,
joined, however, with George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, in
providing for the poet all that was required to secure to him the
quiet life that he desired.

This is an atom: 
Provision to such end had been promised
him both by Charles I. and Charles II., in the definite form of the
office of Master of the Savoy, but the post was given by Charles
II.

This is an atom: 
Cowley recast his old comedy of "The Guardian," and produced it in
December, 1661, as "Cutter of Coleman Street.

This is an atom: 
" It was played for
a week to a full audience, though some condemned it on the supposition
it was a satire upon the king's party.

This is an atom: 
Albans and the Duke of Buckingham, was in the form of such a lease of
the Queen's lands as gave the poet a sufficient income.

This is an atom: 
Others who
had served little were enriched; but he was set at ease, and sought
no more.

This is an atom: 
He then made his home by the Thames, first at Barn Elms,
and afterwards at Chertsey, at which latter place he lived for
about a year in the Porch House, that yet stands.

This is an atom: 
Cowley was living
at Chertsey when a July evening in damp meadows gave him a cold, of
which he died within a fortnight.

This is an atom: 
That was in the year 1667, year also of the death of Jeremy Taylor,
and of the birth of Jonathan Swift.

This is an atom: 
Abraham Cowley is at his truest in these ESSAYS, written during the
last seven years of his life.

This is an atom: 
They have, for their keynote, the happiness of one who
loves true liberty in quiet possession of himself.

This is an atom: 
When he turns
to the Latins, his translations are all from those lines which
would have dwelt most pleasantly upon a mind that to the last held
by the devout wish expressed by himself in a poem of his early
youth--(A Vote, in "Sylva"):

"Books should, not business, entertain the light, And sleep, as
undisturbed as death, the night.

This is an atom: 
My garden, painted o'er With Nature's hand, not Art's, should
pleasures yield, Horace might envy in his Sabine field.

This is an atom: 
The liberty of a people consists in being governed by laws which
they have made themselves, under whatsoever form it be of government;
the liberty of a private man in being master of his own time and
actions, as far as may consist with the laws of God and of his
country.I fear nothing unless it may be
the foot-race, for I have lost my strength with want of food and being
tossed by the waves.

This is an atom: 
"

He ended, and King Alkinoös stepped forward, for the young men were
all silent.

This is an atom: 
"Stranger," he said, "thou art our dearly loved guest,
and no one can doubt thy bravery.

This is an atom: 
Come, then, young men, show your skill in dancing,
that our guest may tell his people when he reaches his home how much
we outdo all others in that art.

This is an atom: 
And let a herald hasten to the palace
and bring the lyre of Demodokos, which has been left there.

This is an atom: 
"

The young men arranged themselves in two rows on the polished floors
and began the dance, while the minstrel, standing in their midst,
played on the lyre and sang most sweetly.

This is an atom: 
All danced very well; but two of the sons of the king came out and
danced alone, for none of the others equalled them.

This is an atom: 
One of them held
a golden ball in his hand, and bending backward threw it so high that
it seemed to touch the clouds.

This is an atom: 
The other sprang up and caught it easily
before it touched the ground.

This is an atom: 
They both danced, going through intricate and rhythmical figures,
while the other young men stood around in a circle and clapped their
hands, keeping time.

This is an atom: 
"

These words pleased Alkinoös greatly, and he said to his people:
"Listen, my chiefs, for our guest seems to be a wise man.

This is an atom: 
It becomes
us now to bestow upon him the gifts of hospitality.

This is an atom: 
In this land there
are twelve kings.

This is an atom: 
Let each one of us bring a
fine cloak, and a tunic, and a talent of gold, that our guest may
see them before he partakes of the evening banquet.

This is an atom: 
" All the chiefs approved the words of King
Alkinoös, and each one sent a servant to his house to bring a valuable
present.

This is an atom: 
He brought a brass sword with
a silver hilt to Odysseus, and said: "My father, if I have uttered
any offensive word to thee, may the winds scatter all remembrance
of it.

This is an atom: 
May the gods grant thee a speedy return to thy country, where
thou shalt see thy wife and friends from whom thou hast so long been
separated.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus answered: "Hail to thee, also, my friend!

This is an atom: 
May the gods give
thee all that there is good, and may no need of this sword ever come
to thee.

This is an atom: 
" Odysseus took the sword and threw it across his shoulders.

This is an atom: 
The sun had set, and the servants carried the gifts to the royal palace,
where the queen took care of them.

This is an atom: 
King Alkinoös led the way to the
palace, his guest at his side and the princes following.

This is an atom: 
When they
had taken their seats on high thrones, the king told his wife to lay
the royal presents in a chest, adding a much richer cloak and tunic
than anyone else had given as a gift from himself.

This is an atom: 
Aretè did as her husband wished, and placed a beautiful cup of gold
also in the chest, and led Odysseus up to look at the presents.

This is an atom: 
Then
she taught him how to lock the chest and unlock it, and her maids
called him to a warm bath, after which he anointed himself with
fragrant oil and put on fresh garments.

This is an atom: 
While he was wending his way to the men who sat before their wine,
he met Nausicaä in her goddess-like beauty, standing near a pillar.

This is an atom: 
Do not forget that I was the first to befriend
thee in the land of the Phæacians.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus answered: "May the gods be as sure to favor my return to
my home as I shall be to make a prayer daily in thy behalf, fair maiden,
who hath saved my life.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XII
ODYSSEUS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES


When they had all eaten and drunk to their hearts' content, the hero
begged Demodokos to sing about the invention of the wooden horse with
which Odysseus had artfully tricked the Trojans to their own
destruction.

This is an atom: 
The minstrel felt the inspiration of the song, and began where the
Greeks threw firebrands into their own tents and sailed away from
Troy, pretending that they had given up the war.

This is an atom: 
He told how the Trojans wondered what to do with the huge wooden horse
which the enemy had left in their city, whether to hew it to pieces
and burn it, or to drag it to the edge of a high rock and throw it
over, or whether to spare it as an act of reverence to the gods.

This is an atom: 
This
last was done, and in the night Odysseus and his men came out of the
great wooden trap and set fire to the city while the men of Troy slept.

This is an atom: 
As Demodokos sang, tears rolled down the cheeks of Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
but no
one noticed his weeping except the king, who said: "It is better to
stop the song of Demodokos, as it does not delight us all.

This is an atom: 
Ever since
the bard began to sing, our guest has been weeping.

This is an atom: 
Let the song cease, and let us all make
merry.

This is an atom: 
And, honored stranger, tell us
the name of thy father, and the city which is thy home.

This is an atom: 
Our seamen
shall take thee safely to thine own land, although there is a prophecy
that one of our good ships shall be changed into a high rock, to stand
forever in front of our city, if we show such courtesies to strangers.

This is an atom: 
"Tell us truly who thou art and whither thou hast roamed, what tribes
of men thou hast seen, and why thou dost weep when the minstrel sings
of Troy.

This is an atom: 
" Odysseus replied: "In
truth, O king, it is a pleasant thing to listen to a bard like Demodokos,
for his voice is as sweet as the voice of a god.

This is an atom: 
"And I cannot think of anything more delightful than the joy of a
contented people listening to a great poet and singer while seated
at a feast in a royal hall.

This is an atom: 
But I pine to be at home, and I will declare
my name and tell the story of my sufferings.

This is an atom: 
"I am the chieftain Odysseus, son of Laertes, and widely known to
fame.

This is an atom: 
I dwell in sunny Ithaca, whose high mountains are seen from
afar, covered with rustling trees.

This is an atom: 
Ithaca has low shores on the east.

This is an atom: 
When the Trojan war was at an end, I started for home
with my twelve ships, but a contrary wind drove us to Ismaros, the
city of the Kikonians.

This is an atom: 
Then I exhorted
my comrades to fly, but, like madmen, they remained on the sea-shore.

This is an atom: 
Then they slaughtered a large number of sheep and oxen and made a
feast.

This is an atom: 
The Kikonians called on their strong neighbors to come and
help them, and they came in swarms with their brazen spears.

This is an atom: 
"Brisk handling of our oars soon carried us out into the sea, but
Jove sent a hurricane that tore our sails and split our masts, so
that our sailors drew them into the ships in fear.

This is an atom: 
Two days and nights
we lay helpless in our boats, worn out with fear and grief, but the
third day the sun shone on us again, and we raised the masts and sails
to take the breeze, hoping to reach our own land.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XIII
THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS


"We sailed onward in a westerly direction, heading for the Grecian
shore, and thought our trials would soon be at an end.

This is an atom: 
But in this
we were disappointed, for when we were about to round the cape at
the southern point of Greece, we met an evil wind which always blows
there, and it drove us far to the east, beyond the island of Cythera.

This is an atom: 
"Nine days and nine nights we were driven about on the sea by the
violent storm, and on the tenth we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters.

This is an atom: 
These men eat flowers that look like water-lilies, and they have no
other food.

This is an atom: 
We landed on the shore of the mainland, and my comrades
took their evening meal close to the boats.

This is an atom: 
"When our hunger was satisfied, I sent out two of the best men to
explore the country about and find out what sort of people the
Lotus-eaters were.

This is an atom: 
I sent a herald with them, whom they might send
back with the news.

This is an atom: 
"They soon found themselves among the Lotus-eaters, who were gentle
and friendly, and gave them the lotus plant to eat.

This is an atom: 
This food is
pleasant to the taste, but dangerous; for anyone who eats of it loses
all desire to return to his own home.

This is an atom: 
"As soon as my comrades had eaten of the lotus, they became attached
to the Lotus-eaters, and desired to remain with them.

This is an atom: 
They wept
bitterly when I commanded them to return to the ships, and I was
obliged to force them to go.

This is an atom: 
"I bound them down to the benches in the ships, and the whole company
went on board in haste lest they should never think of their homes
again.

This is an atom: 
Each man bent to his oars, and the waves were soon white with
the beating of the ships against them as we sailed with all haste
in the direction of our own land.

This is an atom: 
They never plough the fields nor plant them, for everything
grows of its own accord--wheat, and barley, and the vine.

This is an atom: 
The Cyclops do not come together in a friendly way,
but live in caves near the mountain tops, each one in his own den.

This is an atom: 
They do not care much for one another, and each rules his wife and
children as he likes.

This is an atom: 
"There is a little woody island lying at the entrance to the land
of the Cyclops, on which swarm numberless wild goats, never disturbed
by human beings, for the Cyclops have no ships to take them over.

This is an atom: 
This island is very fertile, but there are no sheep to eat the grass
and no people to plough the fields.

This is an atom: 
The island has a harbor which is safe, and the ships that enter it
have no need of anchors or fastenings.

This is an atom: 
"In the midst of the harbor there is a cliff, from which bubbles forth
a spring of excellent water, and poplar-trees grow all around it.

This is an atom: 
The soil is so rich it might bear all kinds of fruit, if there were
anyone to plant them.

This is an atom: 
"We were shaping our course toward this island, and a good breeze
brought us there on a dark night.

This is an atom: 
When daylight appeared we
beheld with wonder the island where the wild goats abounded.

This is an atom: 
My
comrades walked around, admiring the beauty of the place, while the
nymphs, daughters of Zeus, roused the goats that they might give us
milk.

This is an atom: 
We took our bows and arrows from the ships immediately and,
forming three hunting-parties, killed a great number of the nimble
creatures.

This is an atom: 
Each of my twelve ships received nine goats as its share,
but mine received ten.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XIV
THE CAVE OF THE CYCLOPS


"The next day I started with twelve men, the crew of my own ship,
to find out what kind of men inhabited the country opposite us, leaving
all the other boats and their men on the island.

This is an atom: 
When we sailed up
to the coast of the mainland, we heard the voices of giants, and the
bleating of their sheep and goats.

This is an atom: 
And we saw a cave with a high roof,
over whose entrance grew laurel shrubs, and many cattle, sheep, and
goats were lying around at rest.

This is an atom: 
We found an enclosure of rough stone
in the form of a court, with tall pines and leafy oaks at the mouth
of the cave.

This is an atom: 
"The largest giant of all the race of Cyclops dwelt there and took
care of his cattle all alone.

This is an atom: 
We had carried with us a wine-skin full of wine which a priest of
Apollo had given us.

This is an atom: 
The wine was very fragrant and so pleasant that
no one who had once tasted it, could let it alone.

This is an atom: 
We had taken along
a basket of food also, for fear of meeting with men of great strength
and no sense of the courtesy due to strangers.

This is an atom: 
There were
baskets all about heaped with cheeses, and pens of lambs separated
into three folds, the older in one pen, the younger in another, and
the youngest in a third.

This is an atom: 
My companions ate as much of the cheese as they liked, after
which they begged to drive all the lambs and kids down to the ship.

This is an atom: 
"But I would not allow this.

This is an atom: 
I thought
he would give me a handsome present, according to the laws of
hospitality.

This is an atom: 
It was cold in the cave, so we lit a fire and sat down
to wait for the owner to arrive.

This is an atom: 
"He came toward evening, carrying a load of wood on his back, which
he threw down with such a crash that my men ran with terror into the
corners of the cave.

This is an atom: 
The giant drove all such sheep and goats as would
give him milk into the cave, leaving the others in the outside court,
and then closed up the entrance with a rock so large that twenty-four
four-wheeled wagons could not have moved it.

This is an atom: 
"Next, he curdled half of the milk and put the curd into woven baskets,
but he kept the other half for his evening meal.

This is an atom: 
When he had ended
this work he lit a fire, and seeing the strangers he began to ask
them questions, to find out who they were.

This is an atom: 
His voice was deep and
frightful, like the rumbling of a volcano, and our hearts trembled,
but I found words to answer him: 'We are Greeks, and come from Troy.

This is an atom: 
But now
we throw ourselves at thy feet and pray that thou wilt receive us
as guests, or else give us the gifts that are due to strangers, lest
the gods avenge us.

This is an atom: 
'

"Having said this, I stopped, but the Cyclops told us that we were
fools to believe in the gods.

This is an atom: 
If I spare thee it will
be of my own free will, and not for fear of the gods.

This is an atom: 
Are they near here or far off?

This is an atom: 
' This he said hoping to
deceive us, but I saw through his trick, and replied: 'The storm has
thrown our ships upon the cliffs and broken them to pieces, and we
had to swim for our lives.

This is an atom: 
'

"The cruel monster did not answer me again, but he seized two of my
companions and dashed them to the ground with such force that they
died on the spot.

This is an atom: 
He
left nothing of them, neither bones nor flesh nor hair.

This is an atom: 
We wept aloud
and prayed to Zeus with our hearts full of despair.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XV
THE BLINDING OF THE CYCLOPS


"When the monster had filled himself with food, he stretched out on
the floor of the cave to sleep.

This is an atom: 
Then the thought came to me to thrust
a sword into his heart.

This is an atom: 
But this was not a wise course to take, because
we should never have been able to remove the stone from the entrance
to the cave.

This is an atom: 
As soon as daylight
appeared, the Cyclops woke up and lit a fire and milked his sheep
again.

This is an atom: 
Then he seized two more of my companions and devoured them.

This is an atom: 
When his morning meal was done he rolled the stone back from the door
and drove his beasts out, not forgetting to secure the entrance.

This is an atom: 
We
could hear his noisy shouts afar off as he led his flocks over the
grassy heights, and we began to make plans to destroy him.

This is an atom: 
"We found a great club of green olive-wood in the cave; one that the
Cyclops had cut for his own use.

This is an atom: 
I cut off a fathom's length
from this club and handed the piece to my companions, who smoothed
off its sides and sharpened it at one end.

This is an atom: 
The stick became very hard, and
then I hid the weapon under a heap of litter which was piled up in
the cave.

This is an atom: 
We cast lots to see who should assist me to put out the
eye of the Cyclops when he was asleep.

This is an atom: 
"When evening came the Cyclops returned to the cave with his fat sheep
and kids.

This is an atom: 
He seemed to suspect that there was mischief afoot, for
he did not leave any of them outside.

This is an atom: 
After milking the ewes and goats
he again seized two of my companions and made his supper of them.

This is an atom: 
But I filled a large drinking-vessel with the wine from our wine-skin
and stepped boldly out and said to him: 'Here is a cup of wine which
I brought, hoping that thou wouldst spare my life, O Cyclops, for
thy wrath is boundless.

This is an atom: 
The wine delighted
him greatly, and he handed me the cup after emptying it and said:
'Give me another draught and tell me thy name.

This is an atom: 
We, too, have wine, but not
such as yours.

This is an atom: 
'

"Three times I filled the cup and brought it to him, and three times
the Cyclops drank it like a madman.

This is an atom: 
When the wine had overpowered
him, I said to him: 'Cyclops, thou dost wish to know my name, and
I will tell it, but thou must give me the present thou hast promised.

This is an atom: 
' 'Then,' said the Cyclops, 'I shall eat Nobody
last of all.

This is an atom: 
'

"After these words he fell asleep and, being very drunk, he began
to spew out the wine and flesh he had taken.

This is an atom: 
I took the piece of
olive-wood which my men had sharpened and put the point of it into
the fire and held it there until it was a glowing coal.

This is an atom: 
We thrust the
burning stick into the Cyclops' eye and put it out.

This is an atom: 
He howled with
pain, and, stung to madness, he seized the stick and flung it across
the cave.

This is an atom: 
"He called to the other Cyclops, who lived in divers caves on the
surrounding mountains, while we hid ourselves in fear in the most
remote corners of the cave.

This is an atom: 
The giants heard him and came running
to help him, but they could not get into the cave.

This is an atom: 
They stood near
the stone, close to the door, and called out: 'What ails thee,
Polyphemus?

This is an atom: 
' cried
Polyphemus, 'Nobody is trying to kill me.

This is an atom: 
'

"With these words they went off, and we rejoiced greatly that my trick
had deceived them.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XVI
ODYSSEUS AND HIS COMPANIONS LEAVE THE LAND OF THE CYCLOPS


"Polyphemus, groaning with pain, tried to feel his way with his hands
to the mouth of the cavern.

This is an atom: 
Having succeeded in this, he rolled back
the stone and sat down at the entrance and stretched out his hands
in order to catch us if we should happen to try to get out among the
sheep.

This is an atom: 
There were
in the cave a number of stout and woolly rams.

This is an atom: 
Of these I put three
abreast and tied them together with twigs that happened to be in the
cave.

This is an atom: 
The two sheep,
one on each side of him, hid the man completely.

This is an atom: 
For myself I selected
the stoutest ram of the flock, and, seizing his long shaggy wool with
my hands, held fast to him with my knees and arms.

This is an atom: 
"The sun rose and the animals began to hasten out to the pastures.

This is an atom: 
The Cyclops, though nearly exhausted with pain, passed his hands over
the backs of the sheep to find out whether any of us were trying to
ride out of the cave.

This is an atom: 
Last of all, the ram that carried me came to the
door, because I was so heavy that he could hardly walk with me hanging
to him.

This is an atom: 
"Polyphemus felt of his back and recognized him at once as his favorite
ram, and said: 'Dearest of all my sheep, why dost thou go last?

This is an atom: 
Commonly thou wert the first of the flock to hasten to the rich pasture
and the cool spring, just as thou wert the first in the evening to
return to thy manger.

This is an atom: 
Dost thou grieve
because thy master hath lost his eye, which Nobody has put out?

This is an atom: 
Couldst thou only speak,
my ram, thou wouldst tell me at once where the scoundrel is; then
thou shouldst see how I would dash him against the rocks.

This is an atom: 
'

"Speaking such words as these, he let the ram go.

This is an atom: 
When we were safely
out of the cave, we gladly took to our feet and drove the fat sheep
down to our boat with all haste.

This is an atom: 
I made signs to them
not to weep aloud, and to hurry the sheep on board the ship.

This is an atom: 
They
did this with all haste, and each man took his place at the oars.

This is an atom: 
"When we were beyond the reach of the Cyclops, I called out to tease
him, 'Ha!

This is an atom: 
Zeus and the other gods have avenged the brave men whom thou didst
so cruelly destroy.

This is an atom: 
He seized a large rock
and threw it with all his might toward the place where he had heard
my voice.

This is an atom: 
"The rock fell in front of my ship, and the waves which it raised
carried us back on shore.

This is an atom: 
I seized a large pole and shoved the boat
back into the water, commanding my men to ply their oars vigorously,
that we might escape destruction.

This is an atom: 
My companions begged me not to
excite the dangerous monster further; but when we were a long way
out I shouted to him: 'Cyclops, if ever anybody asks thee who put
out thine eye, tell him it was Odysseus, the son of Laertes, conqueror
of Troy.

This is an atom: 
'

"When Polyphemus heard these words he gave a deep groan, and said
to me: 'Truly did the wise seer, Telemos, foretell that I was to be
blinded by Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
But I thought there would come a large and
powerful man, not such an insignificant little fellow who would cheat
me with wine.

This is an atom: 
I will pray to my father, Poseidon,
to give thee a safe and speedy return to thy native land.

This is an atom: 
He can restore
my eye whenever he will, so I cherish no anger against thee.

This is an atom: 
'

"I knew his deceit, however, and replied: 'I would rather take thy
life, and send thee down to the dark halls of the dead, where thy
father could never restore thy sight.

This is an atom: 
'

"As soon as Polyphemus heard this, he raised his hands to heaven and
prayed to Poseidon, 'My father,' he said, 'hear me, if in truth I
am thy son.

This is an atom: 
May Odysseus never return to his
own country, or, if it be thy will that he reach home and friends
again, let his return be late and sorrowful.

This is an atom: 
May his comrades all
be lost, and may he go back in a borrowed ship, and find new troubles
waiting for him in his house.

This is an atom: 
'

"Poseidon was moved to wrath against me by this prayer, and determined
to take vengeance on me.

This is an atom: 
The Cyclops seized another stone, much larger
than the last, and swinging it round, threw it at us with tremendous
strength.

This is an atom: 
It fell close to the ship, but this time it drove the boat
out into the sea and in the direction of the island where we first
landed.

This is an atom: 
"When we reached the island we found the friends we had left there
waiting anxiously for our return.

This is an atom: 
My men drew their boat up on to
the smooth sand and stepped upon the beach, taking the sheep along
with them.

This is an atom: 
Each man took an equal share, but they gave me the ram
which had saved my life.

This is an atom: 
We took him out upon the beach and offered
him up as a sacrifice to Zeus.

This is an atom: 
"But sacrifices were vain, for Zeus had more evil for us in his mind.

This is an atom: 
We spent the rest of the day on the island, eating and drinking, and
when the sun went down we camped on the shore for the night.

This is an atom: 
In the
morning I called my men to climb the decks and cut the ropes that
kept us fastened to the shore.

This is an atom: 
With all speed they went aboard and
took their oars in hand and set sail for home, glad to escape, but
sorrowing for our lost companions.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XVII
THE ADVENTURES OF ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF ÆOLUS


"We sailed about on unknown seas for many days, when we reached the
island where Æolus made his abode.

This is an atom: 
This island was surrounded by
smooth rocks and guarded by a wall of shining brass.

This is an atom: 
"Æolus had twelve children, six sons and six daughters, and they
banqueted on an endless variety of meats from day to day all the year
round.

This is an atom: 
Æolus was a kindly, genial god; he was master of the winds,
and one could hear the music of sweet pipes in his halls all day,
and the air was fresh and fragrant there.

This is an atom: 
He inquired of the fate of all our companions in the war with Troy,
and we stated what had happened to them.

This is an atom: 
Then we prayed him to send
us home, and the god very kindly gave us a sack made of skin in which
he had tied up all the contrary winds, leaving only the west wind
free to carry us safely home.

This is an atom: 
"I took the great bag of winds and bound it fast to the main mast
of the ship with a silver chain, so that no rude wind could escape
and blow us out of our way.

This is an atom: 
We sailed along nine days and nine nights,
blown by the friendly breeze from the west, and on the tenth we saw
in the distance the mountain tops of Ithaca and the fires along the
shore.

This is an atom: 
"And now I was overcome by a heavy sleep, for I had been guiding the
ship, not daring to trust it to the hand of any of the crew.

This is an atom: 
While
I lay unconscious of what was going on, my companions talked among
themselves and said they believed that the bag which Æolus had given
me contained vast amounts of gold and silver.

This is an atom: 
And they spoke with
great jealousy of the prizes which I had received wherever we had
landed, while they went empty-handed.

This is an atom: 
"The more they talked to one another the more jealous and angry they
grew.

This is an atom: 
They untied the sack and the winds rushed out, much to their
astonishment, and seized the ship, driving it round and round in a
furious storm.

This is an atom: 
I started out of my sleep suddenly and found the bag
open I had so carefully guarded and my companions weeping bitterly.

This is an atom: 
"For a moment I had a mind to throw myself into the sea and make an
end of my troubles forever.

This is an atom: 
But the thought came to me that such an
action would not be noble, so I hid my head in my mantle and lay down
in the bottom of the ship while the violent winds and towering waves
drove us back to the island we had left.

This is an atom: 
We landed there again, and,
having partaken of some food and wine, I sought the halls of Æolus.

This is an atom: 
I told him about the senseless action of my companions,
and begged him to assist me once more.

This is an atom: 
But with a terrible voice he
replied: 'Begone as fast as thou canst out of my island.

This is an atom: 
' In this unkind way he sent
me off, and we sadly entered our ships and made for the open sea,
trusting to the mercy of the winds.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XVIII
ODYSSEUS AT THE HOME OF CIRCÈ


"For six days and six nights we sailed without interruption, but on
the seventh day we reached the city of the Læstrygonians.

This is an atom: 
There the
pastures are so rich in grass that the fields, which are grazed by
one flock of sheep during the day, yield abundant food for another
flock by night.

This is an atom: 
The inhabitants were not only inhospitable, but they
received us with a shower of stones, which they hurled at us and at
our galleys.

This is an atom: 
With
the greatest difficulty I succeeded in saving one ship and a few
companions from the hands of these giants, and I fled with them out
to the high sea.

This is an atom: 
We landed
silently, and gave two days and nights to rest, for we were worn out
with toil and grief.

This is an atom: 
On the third day I climbed to the top of a high
hill and looked over the island.

This is an atom: 
Down below I saw a marble palace,
surrounded by a thick forest.

This is an atom: 
There was smoke rising from the grounds,
so I resolved to return to my men and send out some of them to look
about and explore.

This is an atom: 
"A large stag ran down into my path, on his way to a river to drink,
and I thrust my spear through him and flung him across my neck and
took him to the ship.

This is an atom: 
I threw him at the feet of my men, who were
astonished at his size.

This is an atom: 
"That night we slept on the shore again, and in the morning I told
them that I had seen a palace standing in a thick wood, and that I
wanted to send several men there to try to get food.

This is an atom: 
I divided them into two equal bands,
and we cast lots to see which party should make the adventure.

This is an atom: 
They started forth,
and soon came to a beautiful valley, in which was the splendid house
of Circè, which was built of well-hewn stone.

This is an atom: 
There were beasts of
prey, lions and wolves, around it.

This is an atom: 
The animals were tame; they wagged
their tails and fawned like dogs, but the men were afraid of them.

This is an atom: 
Circè was weaving in the palace and singing a beautiful song.

This is an atom: 
The men heard her as she
went back and forth weaving, and they called aloud.

This is an atom: 
She came to the
door and threw it wide open and bade them enter.

This is an atom: 
The others followed her, and Circè seated them on thrones
and gave them food and wine, but in the wine she had secretly infused
a magic juice which made them forget home and friends and all desire
to see their native land.

This is an atom: 
"When they had eaten and drunk to their hearts' content, she waved
her wand over them, and at once the poor wretches were changed into
grunting pigs, which she shut up in pigsties and threw acorns and
other food fit for swine before them.

This is an atom: 
Although thus transformed and
covered with bristles, they still retained the human mind.

This is an atom: 
Thereupon I quickly hung my sword over my shoulder
and, taking my bow and arrows, hurried off alone, and soon found myself
not far from Circè's palace.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XIX
CIRCÈ INSTRUCTS ODYSSEUS CONCERNING HIS DESCENT TO HADES


"As I lingered in that dangerous valley there appeared to me a youth
whom I knew at once to be Hermes, the messenger of the gods.

This is an atom: 
He gently
took hold of my hand and, looking compassionately on me, said: 'Thou
most unhappy man!

This is an atom: 
Listen to my words and heed them well if
thou wouldst destroy the treacherous schemes of Circè.

This is an atom: 
Its name is Moly among the gods, and no
wicked sorcery can hurt the man who treasures it carefully.

This is an atom: 
Its blossom is as white as milk, and it is hard for men
to tear it from the ground.

This is an atom: 
Take this herb and go fearlessly into
the dwelling of the sorceress; it will guard thee against all mishap.

This is an atom: 
She will bring thee a bowl of wine mingled with the juice of
enchantment, but do not fear to eat or drink anything she may offer
thee, and when she touches thy head with her magic wand, then rush
upon her quickly with drawn sword as though about to slay her.

This is an atom: 
She
will crouch in fear and entreat thee with soft words to spare her.

This is an atom: 
But do not give way to her until she has pledged herself by the great
oath of the gods to do thee no harm.

This is an atom: 
'

"When Hermes had spoken thus he left me, to return to high Olympos,
and I walked to the house of Circè with a braver heart.

This is an atom: 
As I came
near the palace I called out to the goddess with a loud voice, and
she threw open the doors for me to enter.

This is an atom: 
She bade me sit down on
a beautiful throne and placed a golden foot-stool under my feet.

This is an atom: 
Then
she gave me the dangerous cup and I drank it off, but her charm did
not work.

This is an atom: 
"Scarcely had I drained the cup when the goddess struck me with her
wand and said: 'Off with you!

This is an atom: 
Go to the pigsty, where friends await
thy coming!

This is an atom: 
' In a twinkling I had my sword in hand and rushed upon
her as if to kill her.

This is an atom: 
Circè shrieked with fear and fell on her knees
to implore my mercy.

This is an atom: 
'Thou art the first man over whom my magic wine has had no
power.

This is an atom: 
Art thou really that Odysseus of whom Hermes told me that he
was to come here after many wanderings?

This is an atom: 
'

"I answered her: 'O, goddess, how can I have faith in thy words, since
thou hast changed my companions into swine and dost plot the same
fate for me?

This is an atom: 
Swear me the great oath that thou wilt not harm me, and
I shall trust thy words.

This is an atom: 
'

"Circè at once took the great oath, that she would never again try
to do me any harm, and she ordered her servants to spread a feast
before me.

This is an atom: 
I sat down in silence, my mind
full of grief and doubt.

This is an atom: 
"When Circè saw that I did not touch the food she said: 'Why art thou
so quiet and speechless?

This is an atom: 
'
But I answered: 'What man with a loyal heart, O goddess, could eat
and drink with any pleasure while his comrades are kept in bondage
and degradation?

This is an atom: 
If thou art really kind and wouldst have me enjoy
this bounteous feast, O let me see my dear companions free once more!

This is an atom: 
She then anointed them with a magic ointment, and their bristles fell
off and they stood up and were men again.

This is an atom: 
They knew me, and each one
seized my hand, shedding tears of joy.

This is an atom: 
Then I sent for the rest of
my men at the ship, who eagerly came up, and together we entered the
halls of Circè, all of us weeping with joy.

This is an atom: 
"Circè's heart was softened also, and she said to me: 'Son of Laertes,
noble Odysseus, do not weep and grieve any longer.

This is an atom: 
Go down to the sea and hide thy
boat near the shore and come back to my halls, thou and all thy men,
where I will make it a happy home for all until thou art rested and
ready to sail again for thy native land.

This is an atom: 
'

"We stayed a whole year on the island of Circè, feasting and enjoying
ourselves, and fully recovered our strength.

This is an atom: 
The desire of reaching
my beloved Ithaca grew stronger within me day by day, and at last
I begged Circè to allow us to depart.

This is an atom: 
'I am not willing, O son of
Laertes,' Circè answered, 'that thou shouldst remain here against
thy wish, but it is necessary that thou shouldst, before departing
from my island, descend into Hades, to the palace of Pluto and
Persephone, to consult the spirit of the Theban seer, Tiresias, on
whom Persephone has bestowed the priceless gift of preserving his
memory even in Hades, whereas all the other souls are moving about
as empty shadows.

This is an atom: 
'

"Hearing this, I grew desperate and no longer had any desire to live
or see the light of day.

This is an atom: 
I said to the goddess: 'Who will show me
the way to Hades?

This is an atom: 
'
She replied: 'Do not worry about a guide, Odysseus, for there will
be no need of one.

This is an atom: 
It flows between the poplars
and willows in the groves of Persephone, and meets the broad waters
of Okeanos.

This is an atom: 
Sail up its dark stream until thou dost reach the rock
where its two branches meet and swirl and roar.

This is an atom: 
There leave thy boat
and dig a ditch in the ground, a foot deep and a foot wide, in which
thou shalt pour honey, milk, wine, and water as an offering to the
dead.

This is an atom: 
"'At the same time pray to the gods of Hades, and promise the shades
of the dead that after thou hast arrived in Ithaca thou wilt sacrifice
to them a whole heifer, the best of thy flock, and to Tiresias
especially a black ram.

This is an atom: 
Then take two sheep, a male and a female,
kill them, and burn them as a sacrifice to the nations of the dead.

This is an atom: 
They will come
by thousands, anxious to drink of the blood, that they may have their
minds again.

This is an atom: 
'

"As Circè said this the daylight appeared, and I woke my companions
and told them to make ready to go with me.

This is an atom: 
I told them that
before setting out for our own country we had, by the advice of Circè,
to go down to Hades in order to consult the seer Tiresias about our
journey.

This is an atom: 
"Circè meantime came up by stealth, and put two sheep into the ship,
and we sailed sadly away.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XX
THE ADVENTURES OF ODYSSEUS IN HADES


"With a heavy heart we sailed from Circè's island bound for the gloomy
Hades.

This is an atom: 
As the wind was favorable, we soon reached the place of which
the goddess had told us.

This is an atom: 
As soon as the dark blood of
the sheep began to flow into the trench countless souls came flocking
from Hades and begged to taste of the blood, that their mortal minds
might be restored to them.

This is an atom: 
"Young wives and girls, old men and young warriors who had fallen
in battle, airy forms, ghosts of all kinds of people, flitted like
bats around me in that dark place with fearful cries, and I turned
pale with fear.

This is an atom: 
I drew my sword and waved them back until I should
question the soul of Tiresias.

This is an atom: 
"But first came the soul of Elpenor, one of my companions who had
gone with me to the palace of Circè.

This is an atom: 
Now, when I saw
him a great pity stirred my heart, and I shed tears and said to him:
'Elpenor, how didst thou come into these dread regions of darkness?

This is an atom: 
'

"The phantom knew me, for, being as yet unburied, he was not one of
the shades, and had not lost his memory or voice, nor did he need
to drink of the blood.

This is an atom: 
He moaned and replied: 'Noble Odysseus, it
was an evil fate which the gods had decreed for me.

This is an atom: 
I lay down to sleep on the roof of
Circè's palace and could not remember the way to the stairs when thou
didst call us to the ships.

This is an atom: 
"'I pray thee now by all those whom thou dost love--thy wife, thy
father, and thy son--that thou leave not my body unburied in the palace
halls, lest I bring on thee the anger of the gods.

This is an atom: 
But on thy return
to Circè's isle burn my body, together with my armor, and pile up
a mound of earth over my ashes.

This is an atom: 
Plant my oar upon my tomb--the oar
with which I used to row while I was living.

This is an atom: 
'

"I made the promise, but at this moment the soul of my mother, whom
I had left hale and strong among the living when I went to the war,
approached and tried to get at the trench.

This is an atom: 
At this moment troops of souls came flocking out of
Hades, and from the countless throng the Theban seer came leaning
on a golden staff, and he ordered me to lay aside my sword and permit
him to drink of the blood.

This is an atom: 
"When he had drunk, he spoke to me and said: 'Odysseus, man of many
woes, why dost thou leave the light of the sun and come down among
the dead?

This is an atom: 
Doubtless thy heart's desire is to return safely home.

This is an atom: 
But
much suffering is in store for thee.

This is an atom: 
Poseidon will not permit it,
because thou hast blinded his son, Polyphemus.

This is an atom: 
Still, thou mayest
overcome all difficulties and see Ithaca at last, if thou dost not
harm the cattle and fat sheep of the Sun on the island of Trinacria.

This is an atom: 
"'But if thou dost kill them and eat of their flesh, I warn thee that
nothing will save thy comrades or thy ships.

This is an atom: 
Even then thou mayest
be saved, but it will be on a strange ship, alone, and after dreadful
sufferings.

This is an atom: 
And at home thou wilt find other misfortunes awaiting
thee.

This is an atom: 
"'There will be a mob of lawless men rioting in thy house, squandering
thy riches, and trying to get thy wife to marry one of them.

This is an atom: 
Thou
shalt kill these violent men in thy halls by craft or in open fight.

This is an atom: 
After that thou shalt reach a good and prosperous old age, and find
a peaceful death far away from the sea.

This is an atom: 
'"


CHAPTER XXI
ODYSSEUS CONVERSES WITH HIS MOTHER AND AGAMEMNON


"When Tiresias had gone, my mother came back to the dark trench and
drank of the blood.

This is an atom: 
She knew me at once and cried out: 'Oh, my child,
how didst thou ever come down to this gloomy place alive?

This is an atom: 
And hast thou not seen Ithaca yet, nor
thy wife and child?

This is an atom: 
I have been driven
about on strange seas from year to year, and have suffered misfortune
after misfortune.

This is an atom: 
Do they still hold rule over
Ithaca?

This is an atom: 
How fares my wife, Penelope?

This is an atom: 
Is she still faithful
to the husband of her youth, or has she married another?

This is an atom: 
'

"To all this my mother answered: 'My son, Penelope is in the home
where thou didst leave her, and she weeps for thee day and night.

This is an atom: 
But thy father dwells on thy farm, and shares the life of
the servants.

This is an atom: 
The grief he feels
for loss of thee has made him old, and will hasten his death, as it
caused mine, for I could not live without thee.

This is an atom: 
'

"So spake my mother, and I longed to clasp her to my heart.

This is an atom: 
Three
times I threw my arms around her, and three times she passed through
them like a shadow.

This is an atom: 
why can I not clasp thee to my heart and hold thee in my arms, that
we may lose for a while our sense of loneliness and misery?

This is an atom: 
'

"My mother spoke and said: 'It is the lot of all our race when they
are dead.

This is an atom: 
When life departs we have no bones and flesh, but the soul
flies off and flits about from one place to another.

This is an atom: 
Hasten back to
the pleasant daylight, and when thou dost reach home tell thy wife
what I have said.

This is an atom: 
'

"When my mother had gone, I saw the soul of Agamemnon approaching,
together with the shades of those of his companions who had perished
with him.

This is an atom: 
The moment he had drunk of the blood he knew me and raised
a loud wail.

This is an atom: 
He stretched out his hands to me, and I tried to seize
them, but I clutched only the empty air.

This is an atom: 
"Then I began to weep, too, and said to him: 'Famous son of Atreus,
King Agamemnon, tell me how thou didst die.

This is an atom: 
Did Poseidon wreck thee
on the sea in a terrible storm, or didst thou fall in war, fighting
on the land?

This is an atom: 
'When I trod my native soil again after
a long absence,' he said, 'I was overcome with joy at the thought
of seeing my wife and children once more.

This is an atom: 
But I was slain in my own
home, and my wife did not even close my eyes as my soul came on its
way to these dark realms.

This is an atom: 
how the gods must hate the family of Atreus on
account of the unfaithfulness of its women!

This is an atom: 
Penelope is wise and virtuous.

This is an atom: 
I
remember, when we were ready to start for Troy she was a young wife
with a little babe in her arms, which she pressed to her bosom.

This is an atom: 
"'No such good fortune can ever come to me.

This is an atom: 
My wife did not even let
me see my son before she slew me.

This is an atom: 
'

"'Son of Atreus,' I said, 'do not ask me where thy son is.

This is an atom: 
I cannot
tell whether he is alive or not, and this is no time for idle
conjectures;' and we wept as I spoke.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XXII
CONVERSATION WITH ACHILLES AND OTHER HEROES


"While we were conversing thus, the shades of Achilles and Patroklos
came near.

This is an atom: 
The soul of Achilles recognized me, and he said: 'Odysseus,
son of Laertes, how darest thou descend into the gloomy habitation
of the dead?

This is an atom: 
This is the greatest labor thou hast undertaken.

This is an atom: 
'

"I answered: 'Godlike Achilles, I came here to consult the seer
Tiresias about my return to my own country, for I have never yet
reached Grecian soil, but have wandered about suffering great
misfortunes.

This is an atom: 
When thou
wert alive all men honored thee as if thou wert a god, and now thou
art a king and rulest over the dead.

This is an atom: 
'

"Then he replied: 'Do not try to console me, Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
I would rather
be the slave of a poor man, and in the light of the sun, than to be
in Hades and rule over all the dead.

This is an atom: 
Does he fight in the wars, and is he in the front ranks?

This is an atom: 
Or do they hold him in contempt, now that he is old, and
I am not there to uphold him?

This is an atom: 
I brought him from
Skyros, myself, in a ship to Troy, and placed him in the Greek army.

This is an atom: 
There he surpassed everyone except Nestor and myself in the wisdom
of his advice, and when we went forth to battle he fought among the
foremost, slaying many illustrious foes.

This is an atom: 
"'Above all, his powers shone forth when we were hidden in the wooden
horse.

This is an atom: 
He called on me to leave the horse and rush
upon the foe, and he smote the Trojans, carrying death and destruction
among them.

This is an atom: 
When we finally subdued the city, thy son took rich booty
and safely reached his own country.

This is an atom: 
He strode proudly
off over the field of Elysian asphodels, well pleased that he had
left such a mighty son on earth.

This is an atom: 
"After Achilles had departed, many other souls came and talked with
me.

This is an atom: 
Only the soul of Ajax kept aloof, still angry over a victory which
I gained near the ships when I took the weapons of Achilles as my
share of the booty.

This is an atom: 
Little did that victory and the arms please me,
since they caused the grave to close over such a hero as Ajax.

This is an atom: 
"I spoke to his soul in gentle words: 'Ajax, son of Telamon, did not
even death appease the anger against me which thou didst feel on
account of my receiving the arms that brought such a calamity upon
the Greeks?

This is an atom: 
"Then I beheld Minos, the lawgiver of Crete, who held a golden sceptre
in his hand and judged the dead.

This is an atom: 
He had under him the great wrong-doers
of one part of Hades.

This is an atom: 
"I saw Sisyphos, also, who suffered great punishment, for he rolled
a large rock uphill with both hands, straining every muscle of his
body to the utmost to move it.

This is an atom: 
No sooner had he pushed it to the top
of the hill than it rolled back with deafening noise to the bottom
of the valley.

This is an atom: 
Again the unfortunate man toiled to move it upward,
the sweat covering his body and clouds of dust hovering over his head.

This is an atom: 
And there came myriads of souls, making
a terrible noise, which filled me with dread, lest I might look upon
the Gorgon, and I hastened back to the ship.

This is an atom: 
I ordered the crew to
go on board, and they took their oars and rowed until we reached the
open sea, where favorable winds caught by the sails wafted us back
to Circè's isle.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XXIII
THE RETURN OF ODYSSEUS TO THE ISLAND OF CIRCÈ


"When we reached Circè's isle, we dragged our vessel up on to the
beach, and lay down to sleep on the shore.

This is an atom: 
We
took it out to a rocky place on the shore, and cut down trees to build
a funeral pyre.

This is an atom: 
There we burned the body and performed the funeral
rites, and we built a tomb and placed an oar at the top of it.

This is an atom: 
"All this was done quietly, but Circè saw us and came with her maids,
bringing a generous supply of food and wine.

This is an atom: 
Standing in our midst,
she said: 'Brave men, who living have gone down to Hades, all men
die once, but you are permitted to die twice.

This is an atom: 
Take food, eat and drink
all day long, and to-morrow at daylight depart for your native land.

This is an atom: 
I will show you the way and teach you how to avoid all danger.

This is an atom: 
'

"We spent the whole day on the shore, eating and drinking, but when
the sun sank down and the earth was covered with darkness my companions
went near the ship to seek rest.

This is an atom: 
After I had told her everything, she said:
'Odysseus, so far all is well, but there are a great many new dangers
ahead.

This is an atom: 
First, thou must pass the Sirens,
who bewitch with their melodious voices all who listen to them.

This is an atom: 
He will never reach his
native land, or see his wife and children again.

This is an atom: 
The Sirens sit in
a green field and sing, while the bones of dead men lie in heaps near
them.

This is an atom: 
Do not listen to them, but pass them by unnoticed.

This is an atom: 
"'Or, if thou wouldst enjoy the matchless singing and not pay the
forfeit with thy life, let thy men bind thee hand and foot to the
mast of thy ship, so that thou canst not by any effort stir a limb
when the great longing seizes thee.

This is an atom: 
And give thy men strict orders
to make thy bonds tighter shouldst thou entreat them to loose thee.

This is an atom: 
Before thou art bound, thou shalt knead soft wax in thy palms and
fill the ears of thy companions with it, that no sound may enter.

This is an atom: 
On each side of the narrows is a steep cliff, one of which
is so high that its sharp top reaches the sky.

This is an atom: 
It is so slippery that
no one is able to climb up or down its sides, nor could he if he had
twenty hands and feet.

This is an atom: 
"'No boat has ever come to the spot and left it without being wrecked,
except Jason's, when he was in search of the Golden Fleece, and he
escaped because a goddess was his guide, to pilot him through.

This is an atom: 
A dark
gray fog forever broods over the head of the cliff, and on its western
side there yawns a fearful cave, where Skylla lives.

This is an atom: 
"'She is a terrible monster that barks like a savage dog, day and
night.

This is an atom: 
Half of her body
is hidden in the rock, but she thrusts out her heads and snatches
her prey, fish, whales, dolphins, or men.

This is an atom: 
No sailor escapes, or,
indeed, any living creature that passes that way.

This is an atom: 
"'The other cliff is not so high, but is still more dangerous.

This is an atom: 
There,
under the foliage of a wild fig-tree, Charybdis dwells, who sucks
in the dark waters of the sea three times a day and belches them forth
again three times with a terrible noise.

This is an atom: 
Woe to thee if thou art near
when she sucks the waters down, for not even Poseidon himself could
save thee.

This is an atom: 
It would be better far to steer close to Skylla, for then
only six of thy men would be snatched from the benches, but if
Charybdis seizes thy ship all must perish.

This is an atom: 
It is better to fly from them with all haste.

This is an atom: 
It would be rashness
and not courage to attack them.

This is an atom: 
"'Next in thy voyage thou wilt come to the island of Trinacria, where
the fine flocks of Helios are feeding.

This is an atom: 
There are seven herds of oxen and seven herds
of sheep, fifty in each herd and flock.

This is an atom: 
These creatures are immortal,
and greatly beloved of Helios, who will send destruction to thy ship
and crew if any harm come to them.

This is an atom: 
If thou art wise enough to escape
these dangers, thou shalt reach thy home without further mischance.

This is an atom: 
Circè sought her own dwelling,
while we put to sea with a favorable wind, and soon the island faded
from our sight.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XXIV
ODYSSEUS MEETS THE SIRENS, SKYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS


"When I saw that we were near the home of the Sirens, I said to my
men: 'It is not wise that only one of us should know the oracles of
Circè, and I will tell you all she said to me, that ye may escape
from the perils before us; and I disclosed her sayings to them.

This is an atom: 
Then
I took a handful of wax and warmed it in the sun until it was soft,
and carefully clogged up their ears.

This is an atom: 
"They, in turn, tied me to the mast, hand and foot, so firmly that
I could not stir a limb, having first received my command that they
should not loose my bonds on any account.

This is an atom: 
Then they bent to their
oars, and rowed close to the Sirens, so that they could see me and
I could hear their bewitching songs.

This is an atom: 
"'Come to us, O renowned Odysseus,' they sang; 'pride of the Greeks,
come and listen to our voices.

This is an atom: 
Come, that we may sing to thee
about Troy and thy friends, for we know everything that is going on
in the whole world.

This is an atom: 
'

"Thus they sang, and their songs thrilled me.

This is an atom: 
A great desire came
over me to stop and listen to them, and with nods I entreated my
comrades to set me free.

This is an atom: 
Then all the men plied their
oars until the water was white with foam, and when we were out of
sight of the island and could no longer hear the songs of the Sirens,
my men set me free, and I took the wax from their ears.

This is an atom: 
"Hardly had we escaped from the Sirens when we beheld a black fog
and towering waves and heard a frightful noise.

This is an atom: 
My men were so scared
that the oars fell from their hands and the ship stood still.

This is an atom: 
Listen, and I will tell you
what is to be done.

This is an atom: 
Keep your seats and ply your oars with all your
might; but thou, O helmsman, steer thy ship clear of that fog and
the whirling waves.

This is an atom: 
"Yet I said nothing to them about Skylla, lest they should lose heart
and hide in the bottom of the ship.

This is an atom: 
Thus we passed in between the
two cliffs, the one of which harbored Skylla and the other Charybdis,
who, with a terrible noise, swallowed the brine of the sea and belched
it out again with a roar like the mingling of fire and water.

This is an atom: 
"But I forgot the command of Circè to fly from these monsters without
fighting.

This is an atom: 
I put on my shining armor and took a spear in each hand,
and went on deck, and stood in warlike attitude ready to attack Skylla
if she should raise a hand to seize one of my men.

This is an atom: 
I looked for a
long time, but I could not see her.

This is an atom: 
The salt waters whirled so that we could look into a deep watery pit
and see the blue sand.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly
Skylla thrust forth a mighty hand and snatched six of my brave men,
as a fisherman pulls out fish with a hook.

This is an atom: 
I saw their hands
outstretched toward me as they were lifted up into the air, and I
heard their cries for help.

This is an atom: 
This sight will haunt me as
long as I have life.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XXV
ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF HELIOS


"When we had escaped from the terrible Skylla and Charybdis, we came
to the island of Helios, the island of the Sun, and heard from afar
the lowing of the cattle and the bleating of the sheep.

This is an atom: 
Then I
remembered the words of Tiresias and Circè, and I advised my
companions not to land there at all, but to go right on, lest we suffer
some new disaster.

This is an atom: 
"My crew would not listen to me.

This is an atom: 
They commanded me to land on the
isle.

This is an atom: 
We prepared our evening meal, and when it was over we talked
of our dear companions whom Skylla had devoured, and we mourned over
them until we fell asleep.

This is an atom: 
"We remained a whole month on this island, on account of unfavorable
winds.

This is an atom: 
We found the roomy grot where the nymphs danced, and the seats
where they sat--the nymphs who tended the flocks of Helios.

This is an atom: 
"As long as we had a plenty of bread and wine my comrades were satisfied
and spared the cattle.

This is an atom: 
But when our store of food was exhausted they
roamed all over the island to see what they could get to appease their
hunger.

This is an atom: 
They snared birds and caught fish with hooks, and lived on
them or anything else that came to hand.

This is an atom: 
I went off alone into the island,
where I had found a quiet nook, and sent up prayers to the gods to
show us the way out of our difficulties.

This is an atom: 
"While I slumbered, Eurylochos called my men together, and said: 'All
kinds of death are bad enough, my brave friends, but death by
starvation is the worst.

This is an atom: 
But if it is his will
to destroy us in his anger, then let us die amid the billows of the
deep, for that is better than to die by famine.

This is an atom: 
They seized
the best of the cattle at once, and slaughtered them, and prepared
a hearty meal.

This is an atom: 
They offered up petitions to the gods, standing round
their victims with young oak-leaves in their hands.

This is an atom: 
Then they covered
the thighs with caul, and laid slices of fat over these, and poured
on water and roasted it until it was consumed.

This is an atom: 
All the rest was cut
into smaller portions and scorched on iron prongs.

This is an atom: 
"At this moment I awoke and hurried down to the ship, and with horror
found the dreadful meal prepared.

This is an atom: 
One of the nymphs, immortal
shepherdess, flew to the Sun to tell him that my men had slain his
cattle.

This is an atom: 
"'If they do not pay me well for this great wrong, I shall go down
among the dead and give them light, but I will give no light to the
living.

This is an atom: 
' 'Shine on, O Sun, in the bright sky,' said Zeus, 'for I will
cut their ship to pieces with a thunder-bolt, as it tosses on a black
sea.

This is an atom: 
' I could only chide my comrades.

This is an atom: 
I could not think of any
sufficient redress, for the cattle were dead.

This is an atom: 
The skins of
the dead animals crawled over the ground, and the flesh lowed as they
had done when alive.

This is an atom: 
Nevertheless, my companions continued to kill
and eat the best oxen in the herds for six days, when a favorable
wind sprang up, and we went on board and set sail once more.

This is an atom: 
"After we had lost sight of land, and nothing was before us but sky
and sea, a sudden darkness shrouded the heavens, and there arose a
violent storm.

This is an atom: 
The vessel was hurled hither and thither by the
towering billows; the hurricane tore the sails and dashed the mast
against the pilot's head, crushing the bones, and he was cast headlong
into the sea.

This is an atom: 
"Then Zeus sent a thunder-bolt into the ship, and broke it nearly
in two.

This is an atom: 
They floated round me, but
I moved about in the ship until the bottom and the sides had broken
away from each other and the mast had snapped off at its base.

This is an atom: 
I took
the mast, which had a thong of bull's-hide round it, and tied it to
the keel.

This is an atom: 
I took my seat upon this frail craft, and the storm whirled
me about.

This is an atom: 
"After awhile the west wind ceased, and the south wind began to blow,
which was still worse for me, since it took me back to dread Charybdis.

This is an atom: 
All night long I was tossed on the waves, and at dawn I drew near
to Charybdis.

This is an atom: 
I waited long, but at last the timbers were thrown
out of the whirlpool, and I dropped down upon them, and sat on them
and rowed with my hands.

This is an atom: 
She welcomed me,
and detained me seven years, as I have already told thee, O Aretè,
and why should I repeat a tale already narrated?

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XXVI
THE DEPARTURE OF ODYSSEUS FROM THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA


All the guests had listened with deep attention to the recital of
Odysseus; all were greatly interested, and when he ended they did
not stir or speak a word.

This is an atom: 
Alkinoös was the first to break the silence,
and he said: "Renowned Odysseus, since thou hast come to our country,
I hope that thy sufferings are at an end and that thou wilt reach
thy native land safely and soon.

This is an atom: 
" Then the King turned to his guests
and addressed them: "Phæacians, let us each present one more gift,
a large tripod and a vase, to the hero who has come among us.

This is an atom: 
"

The Phæacians received his words approvingly, and each went at once
to his home to sleep.

This is an atom: 
But when morning came they all sent their gifts
to the ship, where they were packed carefully under the benches by
the King himself, and the guests returned to the palace, where a
banquet was spread for them.

This is an atom: 
Alkinoös sacrificed an ox to Zeus, and they sat down at the table.

This is an atom: 
They feasted all day, and when the sun was near its setting Odysseus
said: "King Alkinoös, let us pour out the last libation and offer
up the last prayer, for all things have come to pass that my soul
desired.

This is an atom: 
I pray the gods to grant thee all that is
good, and may no evil ever befall thy land.

This is an atom: 
Be pleased to send me
hence, and fare thee well.

This is an atom: 
"

Thus he spoke, right glad that the day was done and eager to set sail.

This is an atom: 
The people approved his timely words, and seizing their goblets they
poured out wine on to the ground, an offering to the gods, and they
wished godspeed to their guest.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus arose and placed a goblet
in the hands of the Queen, addressing her thus: "Farewell, O Queen,
I wish thee a long and happy life, a peaceful old age down to the
grave, from which no one may escape; rejoice in the possession of
thy home, thy people, thy children, and the King, thy husband.

This is an atom: 
The King sent a herald to show
him the way to the port where the ship was waiting for him.

This is an atom: 
At the
same time Aretè also sent down some maids, who carried a new cloak
and tunic, a well-wrought coffer full of gifts, and an abundance of
food for the journey.

This is an atom: 
These things the crew took from their hands and stowed away in the
hold of the vessel.

This is an atom: 
They spread a nice bed for him on the deck, where
he might sleep quietly.

This is an atom: 
When every thing was ready, Odysseus embarked,
and the sailors slipped the cables and took their seats at the oars.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus fell into a deep, sweet slumber, but the ship flew forward
faster than a bird could fly, making rapid headway toward the island
of Ithaca.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXVII
ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT ITHACA


When the morning star arose the ship reached Ithaca.

This is an atom: 
It entered a
harbor called Phorkys, where there was a grotto sacred to the nymphs,
and it was shaded at the entrance by an olive-tree.

This is an atom: 
Stone vases stood
around in the grotto, and there bees had stored up honey.

This is an atom: 
Springs of cool water flowed through the grotto,
and there was an entrance for mortals and one which was kept holy
for the gods.

This is an atom: 
When the ship touched the beach the sailors disembarked and carried
the sleeping Odysseus on a rug on to the shore and laid him down.

This is an atom: 
They brought his presents also from under the ship's benches and laid
them under the olive-tree, a short distance from the road, for fear
that some evil-minded person would take them before Odysseus woke
up.

This is an atom: 
Then the crew sailed homeward, but Poseidon saw them and was angry
because his purpose to cause Odysseus endless suffering had been
thwarted.

This is an atom: 
He at once complained to Zeus that the Phæacians had
restored Odysseus to his native land, with gifts finer and more
valuable than anything he could have brought from Troy.

This is an atom: 
Poseidon promptly repaired to the island of Scheria,
and when the ship came in sight of the town he transformed it into
a towering rock, that it might hide the island from mariners and the
Phæacians would no longer be tempted to escort strangers to their
homes.

This is an atom: 
He did not recognize his own country, he had been away from it for
such a long time, and besides that, Athena had spread a dense fog
over it.

This is an atom: 
He began to accuse them of treachery,
and prayed to Zeus to punish them.

This is an atom: 
He paced up and down the shore and wept and wailed
aloud.

This is an atom: 
Then Athena appeared to him disguised as a shepherd lad.

This is an atom: 
I entreat thee to tell me the name of this country, and what kind
of people inhabit it.

This is an atom: 
" The goddess answered him: "Truly, stranger,
thou must come from a far-off land that thou dost not know Ithaca,
which is known from the rising to the setting of the sun.

This is an atom: 
"It is indeed a stony island but it is not barren, nor is it a good
place for raising horses.

This is an atom: 
It has an
abundance of dew and rain, and most delicious wine is made here.

This is an atom: 
The fame
of Ithaca has reached even as far as Troy itself which, I am told,
lies far from Hellas.

This is an atom: 
But
he did not venture to tell his name to the shepherd, nor whence he
came.

This is an atom: 
Instead of that he told a long story that he came from Crete,
which he had been obliged to leave because he had killed the King's
son, who had robbed him.

This is an atom: 
Athena smiled and, assuming the form of a beautiful woman, took him
by the hand and said: "Thou crafty man, why dost thou tell such lies?

This is an atom: 
Dost thou not know Athena, daughter of Zeus, who has protected thee
everywhere and saved thee from all danger?

This is an atom: 
I have just come again
to assist thee in hiding thy treasures and to tell thee what thou
must encounter in thine own palace.

This is an atom: 
But thou must not repeat anything
which I tell thee, nor make thyself known to any man or woman.

This is an atom: 
And
thou must bear many indignities in silence until the right time comes,
for there are many violent men in thy halls.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus's heart was filled with joy.

This is an atom: 
He knelt down and kissed the
soil of his native land.

This is an atom: 
"Tell me, is it true," he said, "that I am
in my own beloved Ithaca?

This is an atom: 
"

"Thy native land!

This is an atom: 
"Any other man would have hastened with all speed to his wife and
home.

This is an atom: 
But thou must wait and come not at once into the presence of
Penelope.

This is an atom: 
She sits within thy palace, weeping night and day because
thou dost not come.

This is an atom: 
Hide thy gifts here in this grotto, and I will
tell thee what to do next.

This is an atom: 
"

With a glad heart Odysseus saluted the nymphs of the cave and spring:
"Hail to you, nymphs of my native land, daughters of Zeus!

This is an atom: 
I thought
I should never see you again.

This is an atom: 
I shall bring you rich gifts in days
to come, if it please Athena to keep me from harm.

This is an atom: 
" After he had carried
the presents into the grotto and carefully hidden them, he sat down
with the goddess among the gnarled roots of the olive-tree, and they
laid plots to destroy Penelope's impudent suitors.

This is an atom: 
Athena told him
about the trouble they had caused her; how they had established
themselves in her own home, trying to win her for a wife.

This is an atom: 
For three
years the noble Penelope had kept these arrogant men in suspense,
deluded with empty hopes, while she waited for her husband's return.

This is an atom: 
When Odysseus heard these words he was greatly disturbed, and said:
"Woe is me!

This is an atom: 
Stand by me, I pray, in my great need,
and give me strength to meet my enemies.

This is an atom: 
If thou art my helper, I
can resist, single-handed, three hundred foes.

This is an atom: 
"But to carry out our plans I must
change thee to a miserable old man with a wrinkled face and clad in
ragged garments, so that no one can recognize thee.

This is an atom: 
"Then must thou go to thy faithful swineherd, Eumaios, who loves thy
wife and child and thy whole house.

This is an atom: 
"Thou wilt find him as he feeds the swine on acorns in a field near
the mountain, Korax, and the spring, Arethusa.

This is an atom: 
He will tell thee all
the doings in thy house.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos, thy son, is there.

This is an atom: 
He went to visit Menelaos and try to
find out if there were any news of thee.

This is an atom: 
I will call him to return
to Ithaca.

This is an atom: 
"

The goddess touched Odysseus with her magic wand.

This is an atom: 
At once he shrank
and withered into a wrinkled, shabby, old beggar.

This is an atom: 
Then she gave him
a staff and a tattered sack and sent him to his loyal swineherd while
she took her way to Sparta.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: ALPHEUS AND ARETHUSA]


CHAPTER XXVIII
ODYSSEUS SEEKS THE SWINEHERD


Odysseus left the haven by a narrow stony path and took his way to
the dwelling of his faithful swineherd, who thought more of the
welfare of his master than did all the rest of the servants whom
Odysseus had.

This is an atom: 
He found him seated in the yard which he himself had
made of stone for the swine of the absent King, and had enclosed with
a thick hedge of thorns.

This is an atom: 
He had driven strong posts of oak around
it, also.

This is an atom: 
Inside the yard he had made twelve sties, and in each sty
there were fifty sows with their little ones.

This is an atom: 
Near them were four large savage dogs as guards.

This is an atom: 
Eumaios was busy making a pair of sandals from an
ox-hide, for his own use.

This is an atom: 
The other swineherds had gone on errands,
three of them to drive pigs to pasture, while the fourth had taken
a hog to the suitors in the city.

This is an atom: 
When the dogs saw Odysseus they barked and rushed upon him, and they
would have torn him to pieces, but Eumaios drove them off with stones
and said: "Thou poor old man, the dogs came very near tearing thee
limb from limb, and that would have been a great shame and sorrow
to me.

This is an atom: 
"The gods have already sent me trouble enough.

This is an atom: 
Here I sit weeping
and mourning for my beloved master, and take care of his swine in
order that strangers may eat them.

This is an atom: 
Who knows where he may be wandering
as a beggar among people who speak another tongue?

This is an atom: 
But come, old man,
let us go into my lodge and eat, and then thou mayest tell me who
thou art and what misfortunes thou hast suffered.

This is an atom: 
Eumaios threw an
armful of rushes on the floor and covered it with a rug of goat-skin
and bade his guest be seated.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus was gratified at this kind reception, and said to the
swineherd: "May Zeus and all the other immortal gods give thee, my
host, all the good of earth for thy hospitality.

This is an atom: 
"

The good swineherd answered him: "My guest, I should consider it a
great sin not to receive a stranger hospitably, even if he looked
more miserable than thou.

This is an atom: 
The hospitality I can extend to thee is slight but sincere, for
servants have little to offer, especially when, like me, they have
new masters.

This is an atom: 
He would have given
me a home, a little land, and a wife.

This is an atom: 
"

The swineherd drew his belt around him and hastened to the pen where
the pigs were shut up.

This is an atom: 
He seized two little pigs and slew them and
roasted them on a spit over the fire.

This is an atom: 
He sprinkled salt over the savory
meat and brought it to Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
Then he said: "Eat, stranger, for this is the best I have to give.

This is an atom: 
They
gorge themselves with the costliest food in the house, both wine and
meat, and only these little lean porkers are left for us.

This is an atom: 
Yet there
is still an abundance, for my master was very rich.

This is an atom: 
He had twelve
herds of horned cattle and as many swine on the mainland, and twelve
flocks of sheep and goats.

This is an atom: 
Here, on the island, graze eleven flocks
of goats, tended by as many trusty herdsmen, each of whom has to send
a fattened goat for the table of the suitors every day.

This is an atom: 
As for myself,
I take care of these swine, and each day I choose the best to send
to the city.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus ate the flesh and drank the wine while Eumaios was telling
him these things, and could hardly keep from giving vent to his anger.

This is an atom: 
But he kept silence and meditated vengeance on the suitors.

This is an atom: 
When the
meal was done he said: "Tell me, I pray thee, all about thy rich and
kind master.

This is an atom: 
Thou didst say that he went out with Agamemnon to fight
the Trojans.

This is an atom: 
Perhaps I know him and can give thee some information
concerning him.

This is an atom: 
"

The noble swineherd answered: "Be silent, aged man, for we have ceased
to believe the tales told us by wanderers.

This is an atom: 
Every beggar who comes
this way calls on my mistress and tells her falsehoods about seeing
Odysseus, and tries to make her think that he will come home in a
short time.

This is an atom: 
Then she treats him kindly and loads him with gifts.

This is an atom: 
Who knows on what spot of the earth his bones are
mouldering, or what dogs and birds have devoured him?

This is an atom: 
He loved me as he would have loved a son.

This is an atom: 
I shall never find such a kind master again.

This is an atom: 
Even my father and mother
were not so good to me.

This is an atom: 
Although he will never be with us any more,
I keep on doing his will.

This is an atom: 
"

[Illustration: THE SWINEHERD TELLING HIS STORY TO ODYSSEUS]

Odysseus replied: "Thou dost see that I am half naked for want of
clothing, but I will never take a reward, even though I am in rags,
until Odysseus is really here.

This is an atom: 
I call Zeus to witness, and this
hospitable board and the hearth of Odysseus, that what I tell thee
will come true.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus will be here at the end of this month, and
he will be avenged on those men who have robbed him and insulted his
wife and son.

This is an atom: 
"

"And yet I will not give thee any reward for thy news, old man," said
Eumaios, "for Odysseus is dead.

This is an atom: 
Do not take this great oath,
as much as we wish--Laertes, Penelope, Telemachos, and I--that
Odysseus might come.

This is an atom: 
But now, as if we had not troubles enough, a
new one has come upon us.

This is an atom: 
I know not what evil demon put it into the
mind of Telemachos to go to Sparta to inquire about his father.

This is an atom: 
And
the ungodly suitors have sent out a ship to watch for him, and kill
him on his return.

This is an atom: 
We shall lose him, too, if Zeus does not hold a
protecting hand over him.

This is an atom: 
"But tell me, dear old man, from what country dost thou come?

This is an atom: 
"

The time had not yet come when Odysseus thought it best to reveal
himself.

This is an atom: 
He wanted to stay with the swineherd until his son should
return, and he had had the opportunity of making the best plan for
ridding his house of the suitors.

This is an atom: 
He said he was a son of the King of Crete; that
he went to Troy, where he met Odysseus and fought by his side.

This is an atom: 
Returning, he wandered about, and, after many adventures, met
Odysseus again getting ready to return to Ithaca.

This is an atom: 
As for himself,
he had been robbed even to his clothing and cast on this island.

This is an atom: 
He told the tale so well that the swineherd believed him, and even
killed a fat hog in his honor.

This is an atom: 
And he made him welcome to his lodge
and prepared a good bed for him near the fire, and covered him with
goat-skins.

This is an atom: 
The night was cold and damp, and a cutting wind was blowing
outside.

This is an atom: 
The other servants lay down near Odysseus to sleep, but
Eumaios took a sharp sword and thick mantle and went out near the
pens to watch the swine all night.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus saw with gratitude how
faithfully this servant attended to his duty.

This is an atom: 
PART III
THE TRIUMPH OF ODYSSEUS


CHAPTER XXIX
ATHENA ADVISES TELEMACHOS


At the time when Odysseus was wrecked, after his comrades had eaten
of the cattle of Helios, and he was cast up on to the island of Calypso,
Athena prayed to Zeus, her mighty sire, that he might be restored
to Ithaca, his native land.

This is an atom: 
She prayed that Hermes, the messenger
of the gods, might be sent to Calypso with the express command that
she should send Odysseus home.

This is an atom: 
Then Athena tied golden sandals under her feet and taking a long,
heavy spear, she rushed like a whirlwind down from the heights of
Olympos and stood at the doorway of Odysseus' house, among the men
of Ithaca.

This is an atom: 
She was disguised to
resemble Mentor, a wise chief who had led the Taphians in the Trojan
war.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos rose at once, like a gracious host, and took the right
hand of the stranger and gave him a hearty welcome.

This is an atom: 
Athena saw with
anger how the ungodly wooers ate and drank and rioted gluttonously,
while the servants of Telemachos were obliged to administer to their
wants.

This is an atom: 
Some of them were kept mixing the wines and water in large
craters; others had to clear and clean the tables, and others again
prepared and carved the meats and carried them round to the suitors.

This is an atom: 
He bade him sit down
on a throne, and placed a foot-stool under his feet.

This is an atom: 
Then he drew
his own chair from among the suitors and sat near the stranger, hoping
to hear news of his absent father.

This is an atom: 
A maid brought a silver pitcher
and basin and let the stranger wash his hands.

This is an atom: 
When they had enjoyed their meal,
Telemachos asked the stranger his name and country.

This is an atom: 
"I am Mentor, son of the Taphian King," said Athena.

This is an atom: 
"I came here
in my ship with a crew of friends, on a journey to the Isle of Cyprus,
in search of copper, and I brought iron to give in exchange.

This is an atom: 
I have left my ship in the bay, back of
the forest.

This is an atom: 
It is said that he does
not come to the palace any more, but lives alone in the country,
mourning over the loss of his son day and night.

This is an atom: 
It seems that the
gods have long delayed Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
And now tell me, what feast is going on here,
and who are these men?

This is an atom: 
It is not a pleasant sight in any
case, for the men are coarse in their actions and ungodly in their
speech.

This is an atom: 
"

"As long as my father was here," answered Telemachos, "our house was
respectable and rich.

This is an atom: 
But the gods have forsaken us, and we are
destined to destruction.

This is an atom: 
No news of my father's death has ever reached
us; nevertheless, all the young men of the first families of Ithaca
and the surrounding isles flock to our house and seek my mother for
a wife and squander my father's riches.

This is an atom: 
My mother does not favor the
idea of another marriage, and has not promised herself to any of the
suitors.

This is an atom: 
She fears them, and so she does not reject their suits, yet
she will not end the trouble by marrying one of them.

This is an atom: 
They only want a favorable opportunity to kill me.

This is an atom: 
"

Athena grew angry at this, and said: "I would that Odysseus might
come this very moment to chastise these atrocious fellows.

This is an atom: 
Woe to
them if he should appear at the door with his helmet and shield and
two tough spears, just as he looked when I first beheld him in my
own home.

This is an atom: 
Then these suitors would find a bitter marriage-feast and
a speedy end.

This is an atom: 
"Now, let me consider the best way to get these suitors out of the
house.

This is an atom: 
If thy mother has any inclination to wed again, send her to her
father's house.

This is an atom: 
He is rich and powerful, and can give her a splendid
wedding, such as is suitable for the daughter of a king, and bestow
an ample dower.

This is an atom: 
Man it with twenty good oarsmen and
put out to sea in search of thy father.

This is an atom: 
Stay with him awhile if he can assure thee that
thy father lives.

This is an atom: 
But if he tells thee that thy father is surely dead,
return as quickly as possible and build a mound to him, and cause
the altar to be piled high with sacrifices and the funeral games to
take place.

This is an atom: 
"Thou art no longer a child, and it is not seemly to allow such
indignities.

This is an atom: 
Be brave and act without fear, that men may honor thee.

This is an atom: 
When thou hast performed these deeds, let thy care be to drive out
the suitors.

This is an atom: 
But now I must return to my ship, for my companions will
be uneasy over my long absence.

This is an atom: 
I cannot let thee go to thy ship without
some handsome gift, such as one always bestows upon an honored guest.

This is an atom: 
"

"Telemachos, do not detain me longer," replied Athena.

This is an atom:

Many similar oddities break out in the course of the narrative; not
that we care much about them one way or other; it is only to be
regretted that the author has by this looseness of expression, and
his loquacious dragging in of passages from Scripture on all
occasions, also by his inveterate love of anecdotic illustration,
done what he could to keep down a really clever book to an inferior
standard of taste.

Thus spoke Telemachos, the tears running down his cheeks, and he threw
the sceptre on the ground.

This is an atom: 
The people were greatly moved, and felt
pity for the youth who had to suffer such wrongs, but they were silent.

This is an atom: 
Only Antinoös, the most insolent of the suitors, took up the word
and said: "Shameless Telemachos, how dost thou dare to chide us for
this state of things!

This is an atom: 
She
promised, three years ago, to choose one of us for a husband as soon

and width.

This is an atom:

I pray, until I finish these shrouds for the hero Laertes, when his
hour of death shall come.

Besides that, the dames of Greece would
speak ill of me if I should leave my husband's father without a shroud,

This is an atom:

us hope, and we were too generous to persist in forcing her to choose
at once.

This is an atom: 
"She went on in this way, weaving the great web by day, and every
night she unravelled by torchlight all that she had woven by sunlight.

This is an atom: 
We have discovered her fraud; for
a woman who has seen her unravelling the web has told us all about
it.

This is an atom: 
She must finish the work and make her choice among her suitors.

This is an atom: 
If thou dost wish us to leave thy house, thou shalt send thy mother
to her parents and let her father command her to marry one of us,

such malice and craft, we will go right on consuming thy goods.

"I shall never send my mother away from her husband's house," rejoined
Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
"Living or dead, my father is in distant lands, and if
I should dismiss his wife of my own will, I should invite the hatred
of the gods on my guilty head.

This is an atom: 
She would call upon the Furies to haunt
me; all men would curse me; and her father would demand ample
satisfaction of me.

This is an atom: 
Now, get you gone and cease squandering my riches or I will call down
the wrath of the gods on you.

This is an atom:

Having said this, Telemachos sat down, and Zeus sent two eagles flying
over the heads of the wooers, close to each other.

This is an atom: 
They looked down
upon the crowd of people and tore each other's heads and vanished.

This is an atom: 
The Ithacans saw the deadly omen, and a venerable prophet among them

to consume his wealth, until he has nothing left.

Telemachos, thinking it best to be discreet, replied: "Now hear me,

This is an atom: 
If I find
that he lives and may return, I will wait one year longer for him
to reach home.

This is an atom: 
But if I hear that he is not alive, I will come back
and build a mound to his memory and give him a funeral worthy of such
a king.

This is an atom: 
Then shall my mother make her choice and wed.

This is an atom: 
"

Mentor, the stanch friend and adviser of Odysseus, sat among the
Ithacans in the assembly.

This is an atom: 
When he saw how Telemachos was put to shame,
he grew angry.

This is an atom: 
He rose to his feet, and addressed the people: "No
king ever again should be wise and good.

This is an atom: 
He should be hard and unjust,
since no one of you has enough love for Odysseus to stand by his son.

This is an atom: 
I am less ashamed of the impudent suitors, than I am of the weaklings
who see what they are doing and who dare not interfere.

This is an atom: 
" So saying he dispersed the crowd, and
the wooers all went into the palace to continue their revelry.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXII
THE JOURNEY OF TELEMACHOS


Telemachos left the assembly and went down to the sea-shore alone,
and washing his hands in the surf called on the goddess who had
appeared to him the day before to come to his assistance.

This is an atom: 
At once
Athena stood by his side in the guise and with the voice of Mentor.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos took new courage,
and returned at once to his house where he found his old nurse,
Eurycleia, alone.

This is an atom: 
He revealed to her his intention, and asked her
to assist him in getting everything ready for the journey.

This is an atom: 
He bade
her draw twelve jars of the best wine, and twelve skins of the finest
meal to put aboard the ship.

This is an atom: 
When the old nurse heard this she wept and beat her breast.

This is an atom: 
"Dear
child," she said, "who has put such a thought into thy mind?

This is an atom: 
Why
shouldst thou, an only son and well beloved, wander off to a distant
land?

This is an atom: 
The suitors will plot to kill thee and divide thy wealth.

This is an atom: 
Stay here, at home; there is no need that thou shouldst venture over
the fearful sea.

This is an atom: 
"

Telemachos answered her: "Take courage, my good nurse; this journey
is advised of a god.

This is an atom: 
"

The nurse promised most solemnly that she would keep his secret and
execute his orders.

This is an atom: 
She drew the wine into the jars and filled the
strong skins with meal.

This is an atom: 
Meantime, Athena, blue-eyed goddess, taking
the form of Telemachos, went through the city and urged the men to
repair to the ships at sundown, for she had chosen the best boats
in Ithaca for the youth, and found for him a crew that was glad to
serve him.

This is an atom: 
Then the blue-eyed maid went to the palace and poured sleep upon the
eyelids of the drunken suitors.

This is an atom: 
When they reached the galley,
he found his comrades waiting.

This is an atom: 
They hurried up to the palace for the
wine and meal, which they soon brought to the ship and stored in the
hold.

This is an atom: 
Then the crew slipped the cables which held the ship to the
shore.

This is an atom: 
The sails were spread and the sailors began to ply their oars.

This is an atom: 
The people of that town were
all assembled on the shore, where they were sacrificing coal-black
oxen to Poseidon.

This is an atom: 
Some were burning fat upon the altar, and others
were distributing food among those who were offering up the sacrifices,
while all were eating.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos and Athena disembarked,
leaving the crew to guard the ship, and went up to the crowd.

This is an atom: 
When they had come near enough to the inhabitants to be seen by them,
the people rose and came to meet the strangers.

This is an atom: 
First of all, the
son of Nestor, Peisistratos, approached and took each of them by the
hand and led them to the feast.

This is an atom: 
He bade them be seated near his father
and brought them the choicest meat.

This is an atom: 
After the strangers had eaten, Peisistratos filled a golden goblet
with wine, and handed it to Mentor, as the elder.

This is an atom: 
Mentor was pleased
with the young man's good breeding and he took the goblet and poured
out a part of it on the ground as a sacrifice to Poseidon, with a
prayer for a safe return.

This is an atom: 
Then he handed the goblet to Telemachos,
and he did likewise.

This is an atom: 
When the feast was over, Nestor, the King of Pylos, said to his guests:
"The time has come, dear strangers, when it is fitting to ask your
names, and from what land you come.

This is an atom: 
Do you roam the seas as pirates,
or do you come on an errand?

This is an atom: 
"We come from Ithaca to seek tidings
of my father, the unfortunate Odysseus, who went to war against Troy
with thee and the other Greek chiefs.

This is an atom: 
I pray thee tell me anything thou may'st know about him,
and conceal nothing.

This is an atom: 
"

"My son," Nestor replied, "thou dost call to mind the great sufferings
borne by the men of Greece ere we succeeded in conquering Priam's
town.

This is an atom: 
It would take years to tell thee of the brave deeds of the Greeks,
how they fought and where they fell.

This is an atom: 
We passed nine years in worrying
the enemy, and there was no man who gave better counsel or performed
nobler deeds than did Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
How strange to hear so young a
man speak as he did!

This is an atom: 
"After the destruction of Troy, the surviving Greeks embarked, and
we set out for home.

This is an atom: 
But when we reached Tenedos, thy father returned
to Troy to join Agamemnon and the others, who had stayed behind, to
appease the wrath of Athena, for a Greek had committed sacrilege in
her temple.

This is an atom: 
"Our voyage was prosperous, and we all reached home except Menelaos,
who wandered about in Crete and Egypt for a long time.

This is an atom: 
It is said
that the noble son of Achilles returned home safely, and that
Agamemnon was slain in his own house, and his son took vengeance on
his murderers.

This is an atom: 
There is a rumor, too, that many suitors hang about
thy mother, and, in spite of thy remonstrances, consume thy riches.

This is an atom: 
Be brave, my son, and yield not.

This is an atom: 
Go at once
to Menelaos, for he may have news of thy father.

This is an atom: 
"

All day Telemachos discoursed with Nestor, and when the sun went down,
they poured wine on the earth and burned an offering to the gods.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos and Mentor arose to retire to their ship, but Nestor begged
them to be his guests and go to the royal palace.

This is an atom: 
Mentor, as the elder
of the two, excused himself, in order to join the crew, and suddenly
disappeared.

This is an atom: 
The assembly dispersed, and
Nestor, with his guest and his sons, retired to his palace.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXIV
TELEMACHOS IN SPARTA


Before the sun was fairly up, they all arose and seated themselves
on the smooth stone benches that loomed up in the gloaming, white
and shining, before the gates of the palace.

This is an atom: 
Nestor bade one of his
sons to prepare an offering to Athena, of the best heifer in the fields.

This is an atom: 
He sent another son to call a skilled workman to plate the heifer's
horns with gold, and two others yet to bring the crew from the ship.

This is an atom: 
He told the remaining two sons to bid the maids prepare a sumptuous
feast in honor of their guest.

This is an atom: 
In a moment there was a busy scene.

This is an atom: 
The heifer was brought up from
the fields, and her horns were adorned with pure gold in hopes that
Athena would see it and be pleased.

This is an atom: 
The heifer was slain and parts
were burned as an offering to the goddess, and cakes and wine also
were thrown into the flames to complete the sacrifice.

This is an atom: 
They roasted
the flesh on long iron forks with five prongs, and feasted upon it.

This is an atom: 
Then Nestor said to his sons: "Bring now the chariot and horses and
let our guest depart in search of news concerning his renowned
father.

This is an atom: 
" The horses were soon harnessed to the car, which was stored
with wine and bread and dainties fit for a prince.

This is an atom: 
Peisistratos took his place beside him and grasped
the reins.

This is an atom: 
The horses dashed off in high spirit, and Pylos was soon
left in the distance.

This is an atom: 
At night they
rested by the way and early the next morning went on again as swiftly
as before.

This is an atom: 
As the sun went down they found themselves in Sparta, the
land of plenty, and at the gates of Menelaos, the king.

This is an atom: 
Here they found many guests assembled at the wedding banquet of
Hermione, the daughter of Menelaos.

This is an atom: 
That day she had been given as
a bride to Neoptolemos, the son of Achilles.

This is an atom: 
One of the attendants of Menelaos saw the strangers drive up, and
stepped out to see who was coming.

This is an atom: 
Then he hastened back to Menelaos
and told him that two strangers of princely bearing were at the palace
gate, and asked if he should unharness their horses or send them on
their way.

This is an atom: 
Menelaos was vexed that any of his servants should be so
lax in hospitality, and told him he had acted like a foolish child,
and reminded him of the gifts that had been showered on them when
they wandered so long in foreign lands.

This is an atom: 
And he bade him hasten to
unharness the steeds, and give them oats and barley, and bid the
strangers welcome to the feast.

This is an atom: 
They bathed in the marble baths, rubbed themselves with oil and put
on the splendid tunics that were brought them.

This is an atom: 
After that they entered
the great hall, where each was seated on a throne near the king.

This is an atom: 
When they
had eaten enough, golden beakers of wine were handed them, and then
the monarch gave his hand to each of them, saying: "Ye have come in
good time, my friends.

This is an atom: 
As soon as ye have finished your feast, I will
ask your names and whence ye come, for ye look like sons of kings.

This is an atom: 
"

As they sat there Telemachos, bending his head toward Peisistratos,
said, in a low tone, so that he thought no one else would hear: "Surely,
O son of Nestor, the Olympian home of Zeus himself could not be more
glorious than this palace.

This is an atom: 
See the gold and ivory, and shining brass.

This is an atom: 
" Menelaos caught the words,
although he spoke so low, and said: "My sons, there is no palace that
can compare with the home of the gods.

This is an atom: 
The riches which you look at
in astonishment I collected while wandering in Egypt and in Crete.

This is an atom: 
I find no pleasure in them, however, for I found my brother, King
Agamemnon slain when I reached home.

This is an atom: 
Would that the men who fought
before Troy had their share of this wealth!

This is an atom: 
I often weep and mourn
for them in my palace, and am unable to eat or sleep on account of
the misery I have brought upon my friends.

This is an atom: 
"For none of them do I mourn so much as I do for Odysseus, who suffered
the most of all on my behalf.

This is an atom: 
But we do not know whether he is dead
or living.

This is an atom: 
How
many tears his wife, Penelope, must have shed, and his high-minded
son, Telemachos, what sorrow he has suffered.

This is an atom: 
"

New despair filled the heart of Telemachos, and tears fell from his
eyes.

This is an atom: 
He held his purple mantle to hide his grief and wept in silence.

This is an atom: 
When Menelaos saw this, he at once suspected that the young man was
no other than the sorrowing son of Odysseus, and he felt perplexed
for want of suitable words.

This is an atom: 
He could not decide whether to question
him about his father, or to wait and let the youth speak out of his
own will.

This is an atom: 
Just then Helen entered the hall from her high-roofed chamber, looking
like a goddess in her dazzling beauty.

This is an atom: 
She sat down at her husband's
feet, while servants ran to bring the mat which she was weaving and
the distaff filled with fine-spun purple thread.

This is an atom: 
Her fingers flew
over the dainty work while she questioned the king: "Didst thou ask
the strangers their names?

This is an atom: 
It is not possible that there can be any
man so like to Odysseus except his son, as is this youth!

This is an atom: 
His father left him at home a little babe, when
the Greeks went forth to war for my sake.

This is an atom: 
"

Menelaos replied: "My wife, I think thou hast spoken truly.

This is an atom: 
The young
man has the hands, the feet, and the features of Odysseus, and he
cannot hide his grief at the mention of that hero's name.

This is an atom: 
"
Peisistratos took up the word and said: "He is, indeed, the son of
Odysseus, O king!

This is an atom: 
My father, Nestor, sent me with him to inquire what
you might know of the long-lost chieftain, and to beg you to give
him advice, for he has to suffer great wrongs in his house and there
is no one to assist him.

This is an atom: 
"

Menelaos was heartily glad to hear that his guest was really
Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
But the remembrance of his old friend overcame him and
he wept bitter tears.

This is an atom: 
"I thought when I was in Troy," he said, "that
I should one day welcome Odysseus to my home.

This is an atom: 
I would have given him
land and cities and brought to Sparta all his people and his wealth.

This is an atom: 
Then we would always have lived close together and nothing could have
parted us.

This is an atom: 
Peisistratos then said to Menelaos: "Son of
Atreus, my father says that thou art good and wise.

This is an atom: 
Let us not, I
entreat, continue this sad discourse, since this is a day that should
not be given to lamentations.

This is an atom: 
But
we will honor these heroes at a proper time, with tears and by cutting
off our locks.

This is an atom: 
Let us not spoil the feast with mourning.

This is an atom: 
"

They spent the rest of the day in making the festival as cheerful
as if there were no grief to be hidden, and when night came the Argive
Helen ordered the servants to prepare beds for them in the portico
and cover them with tapestries, while she poured for them a soothing
wine and dismissed them to their slumbers.

This is an atom: 
The heralds led them to
their couches, where they found a welcome rest.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXV
MENELAOS RELATES HIS ADVENTURES


The next morning Menelaos rose from his couch very early, put on his
garments, hung his sword over his shoulder, laced his sandals, and
went into his hall looking like a god.

This is an atom: 
He sat down near Telemachos,
and asked him to tell him frankly why he had come to Sparta.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos then told him of the evil deeds of the suitors, and besought
him to give him every possible clew to his father's whereabouts.

This is an atom: 
"Shame on the cowards who wish to rule over thy father's house," he
said.

This is an atom: 
"Let Odysseus return and he will tear them to pieces as a lion
tears a young deer.

This is an atom: 
Grant, O father Zeus, and Athena, and Apollo,
that Odysseus may yet give those ungodly suitors a bitter wedding
feast.

This is an atom: 
But I will tell thee of my travels and what was told me by
the Ancient Spirit of the sea.

This is an atom: 
"It happened that the gods detained me many days in Egypt to sacrifice
and do penance, for I had forgotten to make proper offerings to them.

This is an atom: 
"My men and I had wandered over the island in search of food until
we were nearly starved, when she discovered us, and told us that our
efforts would be useless unless we consulted with her father.

This is an atom: 
'If
thou canst ensnare him and hold him in thy grasp,' she said, 'he will
tell thee how to reach thy home.

This is an atom: 
He is a seer, and can tell thee all
that has taken place there during thy absence.

This is an atom: 
At noon-tide he comes
out from the ocean caves covered with brine, and lies down among the
sea-calves, rank with the smell of salt.

This is an atom: 
He counts them five at a
time, and then he stretches himself out among them and goes to sleep.

This is an atom: 
He is very shrewd, and when thou hast caught him he will struggle
and take all sorts of forms to escape thee.

This is an atom: 
He will turn into a reptile,
and into fire and then will change to water.

This is an atom: 
But hold him fast, and
when he looks as he did when first perceived by thee, ask him how
to find thy home.

This is an atom: 
I took three old comrades whom I knew to be trusty, and we went down
into the depths of the sea.

This is an atom: 
The goddess brought us four fresh hides
that had just been taken from sea-calves newly slaughtered, and we
dressed ourselves in them to deceive her father.

This is an atom: 
She scooped out
places for us to lie in on the sands and we waited for him to come.

This is an atom: 
The smell was sickening and beyond endurance, so the goddess put
ambrosia under our noses.

This is an atom: 
The old seer came out and counted all, and did not notice
our fraud.

This is an atom: 
He began to take all kinds of shapes.

This is an atom: 
First, he was
a lion; then a serpent, a panther, a boar, a fountain of water, and
a tree.

This is an atom: 
'Son of
Atreus,' he said, 'who hath taught thee how to make me a prisoner?

This is an atom: 
' 'Tell me what god is angry with me,
O Proteus,' I replied.

This is an atom: 
Why can
I not reach my home?

This is an atom: 
' 'Thou didst not make acceptable sacrifices to
Zeus,' said Proteus.

This is an atom: 
'And thou wilt never see thy home again until
thou hast offered up a hundred oxen to the immortal gods.

This is an atom: 
'

"'I will perform that rite speedily, oh prophet,' I replied.

This is an atom: 
'

"Then Proteus told me all; how Ajax died amid his ships; how Agamemnon
was slain in his own hall; and of Laertes' son he said that he had
seen him sitting in a grotto on Calypso's Isle.

This is an atom: 
There upon the rocks
or at the ocean-side he weeps and mourns day after day, and gazes
out upon the deep.

This is an atom: 
His comrades are lost, and he has no ship with
which to return to Ithaca.

This is an atom: 
And after he had spoken he plunged into
the sea while I returned to my ships, offered up the hundred oxen
to Zeus and sailed for home.

This is an atom: 
And now, Telemachos, I pray thee remain
awhile with me, and I will dismiss thee with a chariot and swift horses,
and a cup of priceless worth with which to pour libations to the gods.

This is an atom: 
"

Telemachos took new courage when he heard that his father still lived,
and begged that he might go back at once to Pylos to join his crew.

This is an atom: 
In a moment all were busy in the palace of Menelaos preparing gifts
and a feast that the youths might depart on the morrow.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXVI
THE CONSPIRACY OF THE SUITORS


One day while Telemachos was in Sparta, the guest of Menelaos, the
suitors were more riotous than usual.

This is an atom: 
They diverted themselves in
the palace of Odysseus by throwing the discus and javelin.

This is an atom: 
Then Noëmon,
who had given Telemachos his ship a few days before, approached them
and said: "Antinoös, I would gladly know when Telemachos will return
from Pylos.

This is an atom: 
I lent him my ship, and I need it for I intend to go to
Elis, where I have business.

This is an atom: 
"

The suitors were completely taken by surprise, for they had not heard
that Telemachos had gone to Pylos.

This is an atom: 
Antinoös asked: "When did Telemachos
sail, and what crew did he take?

This is an atom: 
"Who would not have
done such a service to a man who has had so much to endure?

This is an atom: 
" Noëmon
could not get any news of Telemachos, so he went home; but the suitors
conspired to kill Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
They decided that Antinoös should man
a ship with a crew of twenty men, and lie in ambush in the waters
near Ithaca, in order that they might catch Telemachos, on his return.

This is an atom: 
This wicked plot of the suitors was betrayed to the queen, by her
faithful herald, Medon.

This is an atom: 
Penelope was overcome with grief, and wept
bitterly, and her loyal attendants mourned with her.

This is an atom: 
"Is it not enough that death
has robbed me of my husband?

This is an atom: 
Am I also to lose my only child, without
even having seen him before his departure?

This is an atom: 
why did no one tell
me he was going, that I might have prevented his journey?

This is an atom: 
Haste ye
to Laertes and tell him what has happened, that he may make some plan
to upset this plot to destroy his heir, the son of Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
"

Then Eurycleia, the nurse, tried to console her with these soothing
words: "My daughter, I will not hide the truth from thee any longer.

This is an atom: 
And I promised him solemnly that I would
not tell thee of his departure, since he had a great dread that thou
wouldst weep and mourn, and spoil thy lovely face and injure thy health.

This is an atom: 
Now dry thy tears and bathe, and put on fresh robes.

This is an atom: 
There pray to Athena and
burn incense to her.

This is an atom: 
She went to the altar, at
the highest part of the house, and there she prayed to Athena: "Hear
me, daughter of Zeus!

This is an atom: 
If ever my beloved husband has sacrificed to
thee the fat limbs of oxen or sheep, and has built thee altars, save
my son, Telemachos, and destroy the suitors, who fain would destroy
him.

This is an atom: 
" The goddess heard her prayer, and sent sweet slumber and a
pleasant dream to assuage her grief.

This is an atom: 
In her sleep she saw her sister,
who said to her: "Be of good cheer, Penelope; no harm will come to
thy son, for a god goes with him.

This is an atom: 
" To her, the wise Penelope, yet
dreaming, answered: "My sister, why is it thou hast never come to
me before?

This is an atom: 
I weep because I have lost my noble
husband, and now his enemies conspire to slay my only son.

This is an atom: 
" The dream
replied: "Take heart.

This is an atom: 
Athena sent me to tell thee that
she will protect thy son.

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh, tell me," cried the queen, in her dreams, "tell me if my husband
lives, since thou art sent by a goddess.

This is an atom: 
In the meantime the suitors spoke among themselves, for they were
too foolish to understand the spirit of the queen.

This is an atom: 
"Surely," they
said, "Penelope is making ready for her wedding.

This is an atom: 
She does not suspect
that we have planned to kill her son.

This is an atom: 
" "Do not deceive yourselves,
my friends," said Antinoös.

This is an atom: 
" Then he chose twenty
men, and they went down to a well-fitted ship, and took their places
at the oars.

This is an atom: 
They waited until it was dark, when they quietly rowed
out into a narrow strait, through which, they thought, Telemachos
was sure to sail on his return, and there they waited.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXVII
TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO ITHACA


Having encouraged Penelope, the goddess Athena sped to Sparta, where
she found Telemachos, with Nestor's son, asleep upon the porch.

This is an atom: 
She
stood beside his bed, and warned him that he ought to return home,
since Penelope's father had given her counsel to wed the richest of
the suitors, and had promised a generous dower.

This is an atom: 
"Do not delay," the
goddess said to him; "no one can tell what a woman will do to help
the man she is to marry.

This is an atom: 
They hope
to catch thee on thy way home and slay thee.

This is an atom: 
When thou dost come
to the first harbor in Ithaca, disembark, and let thy crew go on in
the ship and take it back to the town.

This is an atom: 
But thou shalt make thy way
to the hut of thy loyal swineherd, and he will take tidings of thy
safe return to thy mother.

This is an atom: 
"

Athena said this and vanished.

This is an atom: 
" But Peisistratos begged him to wait until it was fairly
light.

This is an atom: 
Menelaos had slept lightly, he was so agitated with the great
event of seeing his beloved comrade's son, and he rose as soon as
it was light.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos heard him approaching, and hastily threw
on his tunic and cloak and went to meet him.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos urged a hasty departure and Menelaos did not think it
proper to try to detain him.

This is an atom: 
He said: "A host is hateful who is too
affectionate.

This is an atom: 
It is as wrong to keep a guest who is in a hurry to
go as it is to thrust a stranger out when he wants to stay.

This is an atom: 
" The car was heaped with gifts, a golden
goblet, a silver beaker, a robe that glistened with hand-wrought
embroidery, the work of Helen, a goblet of silver with golden lips.

This is an atom: 
They washed their hands in a silver bowl and ate and drank from the
bounty which had been placed before them.

This is an atom: 
Nestor's son took the
reins, Menelaos poured wine on the ground, an offering to the gods
for their safety and prosperity, and off they sped over the plain.

This is an atom: 
Two birds flew on before them, an eagle that had clutched a goose
and bore it off in its talons, a sign that Odysseus would come and
put an end to the suitors, and this omen cheered Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
The
son of Nestor plied the lash.

This is an atom: 
At night they rested in a friendly lodge
and the second day they reached Pylos.

This is an atom: 
They drove directly to the
ship, lest Nestor, in his great love for his guest, should detain
him.

This is an atom: 
With an offering and a prayer to Athena he set sail.

This is an atom: 
At night
Telemachos landed at the nearest port and sent the crew on to take
the ship to the town.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXVIII
TELEMACHOS AND THE SWINEHERD


When daylight appeared Odysseus and Eumaios rose from their beds and
sent the serving men out into the fields with their swine, but they
themselves remained at home and prepared breakfast.

This is an atom: 
In a little while
they heard footsteps outside.

This is an atom: 
The dogs pricked up their ears and
wagged their tails without barking.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus, perceiving this, said to the swineherd: "There must be some
friend of thine coming, since the dogs do not bark.

This is an atom: 
He took
him in his arms as a father would a son who had been away a long time,
and kissed his face and hands.

This is an atom: 
Tears dropped from his eyes and he said: "My dear Telemachos, I did
not dare to hope ever to behold thee again.

This is an atom: 
Come in that I may rejoice
with all my heart at seeing thee once more enter my cabin after thy
return from a strange country.

This is an atom: 
Seldom dost thou come to see thy
servants, for thou dost live in town, where thou must watch the suitor
train consume thy wealth day by day.

This is an atom: 
"

To this Telemachos made answer: "This is quite true, my father; but
I come here to learn of thee how matters are at the palace.

This is an atom: 
Is my
mother there, or has some wooer won her for a bride?

This is an atom: 
"

"Thy mother is still at home," replied the sturdy swineherd.

This is an atom: 
" Saying this
he took the lance from the young prince, who had come farther into
the cabin.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus arose to give him his seat, but Telemachos said
to him: "Keep thy seat, stranger, I will sit elsewhere.

This is an atom: 
The swineherd took an armful of twigs and
covered it with fleeces, and Telemachos seated himself upon it.

This is an atom: 
Next
he brought bread and meat and set them before his young master, who,
when he had eaten, asked his faithful servant who the stranger was
and whence he came.

This is an atom: 
"The stranger says that he came from Crete," answered Eumaios.

This is an atom: 
"Lately
he has run away from a ship where he was robbed, and has come here.

This is an atom: 
"How can I receive
a stranger in my house, since I cannot protect him there if any of
the godless wooers insult him.

This is an atom: 
It would be better for him to stay
here; and lest he be a burden to you I will send out food and clothes
for him, and I will help him to go wherever he wishes.

This is an atom: 
Art thou willing to let this go on?

This is an atom: 
If I
were as young as thou art I would lose my life before I would suffer
such things--thy guests insulted, thy servants beaten, thy riches
thrown away, thy food consumed by gluttons.

This is an atom: 
"

"Thy words are sharp, dear stranger, and I shall answer them with
the truth," said Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
"Thou dost not yet understand that there
is a great crowd of suitors; not simply five or ten.

This is an atom: 
What can I do
single-handed against such a multitude?

This is an atom: 
But you, Eumaios, hasten to
the city, secretly, and tell my mother that I have returned and am
staying here.

This is an atom: 
Then come back at once and let no one know where I am,
for the lovers are plotting a bloody death for me.

This is an atom: 
" The swineherd
hastily bound his sandals on to his feet, took his staff, and hurried
off.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXIX
TELEMACHOS RECOGNIZES ODYSSEUS


It was not long after Eumaios had left the cabin when Athena, in the
guise of a beautiful woman, appeared to Odysseus and beckoned him
to come outside.

This is an atom: 
The dogs did not bark but ran into
a corner of the cabin, crouching and whining.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus left the room
and stood before the goddess, who spoke to him in these words: "Son
of Laertes, of noble birth and great wisdom, make thyself known to
thy son.

This is an atom: 
Advise with him how to put an end
to that insolent crowd of suitors.

This is an atom: 
That touch changed him instantly into a handsome, well-made
man in the full vigor of robust manhood.

This is an atom: 
His cheeks flushed with renewed health and the heavy beard
on his chin grew dark again.

This is an atom: 
After the goddess had done this she
vanished and Odysseus went back into the lodge.

This is an atom: 
His son glanced at
him in amazement and then turned his eyes away from him lest he should
irreverently look upon a god.

This is an atom: 
"Stranger," he said, "I think thou art an immortal whose home is in
the heavens, for thou hast been transformed in looks and garb.

This is an atom: 
Let
me bring a sacrifice and offer it to thee, together with beautiful
gifts, and perhaps thou wilt be gracious to us and keep us from harm.

This is an atom: 
I am thy
father, he for whom thou hast mourned and endured so many sufferings.

This is an atom: 
No mortal could change from a ragged old
beggar to a young and stately man in a moment.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus answered him: "Telemachos, it is not like a son to gaze upon
thy father with astonishment.

This is an atom: 
I have wandered twenty years in foreign
lands, and now have come to my own home.

This is an atom: 
Thou hast seen a miracle
which Athena wrought, for she makes me look like a beggar or a king
as she pleases.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus sat down and his dear son approached him and threw his arms
around him in a loving embrace, and together they wept tears of joy.

This is an atom: 
"

"The Phæacians brought me across the sea and left me sleeping on the
shore in Ithaca," replied Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
"And they gave me rich presents
of gold, and silver, and brass, and embroidered garments hand-woven
from their own looms.

This is an atom: 
"These have I hidden, and Athena has sent me to advise with thee how
best to destroy the arrogant crew of suitors that so long has robbed
my house and vexed my wife.

This is an atom: 
Tell me now how many there are and what
kind of men, so that I can judge whether we two alone may attack them,
or whether we need the help of others.

This is an atom: 
"

"My father," answered Telemachos, "thy sweet fame has resounded
through our halls, my whole life long.

This is an atom: 
How often have I heard of thy
courage and the strength of thy powerful arm.

This is an atom: 
But how is it possible
for us two to fight against such a multitude?

This is an atom: 
Twenty-four come from Samos,
and twenty more from Zakynthos, and twelve from Ithaca.

This is an atom: 
If we attack
them all I fear that we shall come to grief.

This is an atom: 
It is better for us to
look around and find an ally.

This is an atom: 
Zeus and Athena,
most powerful of the gods, are on our side.

This is an atom: 
The swineherd shall lead
me disguised as an old beggar to my palace.

This is an atom: 
Do not resent it except to
administer a gentle reproof, though they strike me with their spears
and abuse me with bad language.

This is an atom: 
When Athena gives me the sign, I will nod to thee and thou shalt remove
my weapons from the great hall to an upper room.

This is an atom: 
Tell the suspicious
suitors that the arms gather too much dust where they now hang on
the walls, and besides that, a god has warned thee that in their
drunken brawls, the wooers may harm each other.

This is an atom: 
Let no one know of
my arrival, not even Laertes, Eumaios, or my wife, Penelope.

This is an atom: 
At noon they killed a yearling pig, and roasted it and made
a hearty lunch.

This is an atom: 
Once more Athena touched Odysseus with her wand and
changed him into a poor old beggar, that Eumaios should not recognize
him.

This is an atom: 
Then he prepared a supper for them, and they ate and drank
to their hearts' content, when they retired to rest.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XL
TELEMACHOS RETURNS TO THE PALACE


Early the next morning Telemachos rose, tied his shining sandals under
his feet, took his spear and stood ready to go to the city.

This is an atom: 
He called
the swineherd to him, and said: "Eumaios, I am going back to the town
to see my mother.

This is an atom: 
I know that she will not cease to be anxious about
me until she sees me in my own home.

This is an atom: 
Take this stranger there, too,
where he may beg, and thus supply his wants.

This is an atom: 
I cannot receive every
poor man into my own house; my trials are too great.

This is an atom: 
It makes no
difference to me whether he likes it or not.

This is an atom: 
I think
myself it is better for me to go to the city, where a beggar may have
a fair chance.

This is an atom: 
Go thy way, my
son, and let thy servant lead me hence, as thou hast commanded.

This is an atom: 
"

Then Telemachos went out of the lodge and sped toward the city.

This is an atom: 
His
old nurse, Eurycleia, was the first to see him, and she ran out to
welcome him, and the other servants came around rejoicing.

This is an atom: 
"Hast thou indeed returned,
Telemachos, my son?

This is an atom: 
What hast
thou seen?

This is an atom: 
"Dear mother, do not waken my grief again," Telemachos replied.

This is an atom: 
But go to thy bath and put fresh
garments on, and then pray to the gods and promise them great
sacrifices if Zeus will avenge our wrongs.

This is an atom: 
" Penelope willingly did
her son's bidding, but Telemachos betook himself to the market place
to show himself to the people.

This is an atom: 
He wanted them to see that he was in Ithaca, but
he did not care to be in their company, so he took his place among
some friends of his father.

This is an atom: 
One of the crew came up to ask where he
might deposit the splendid gifts of Menelaos, and Telemachos told
him to hide them until the suitors had been defeated or had won the
victory.

This is an atom: 
Then Telemachos came back to the palace in company with a stranger
who had joined his crew at Pylos, and they sat down near the queen,
who was spinning.

This is an atom: 
The servants brought them wine and food, and after
they had eaten, Penelope begged that her son would recite to her the
story of his journey.

This is an atom: 
When they reached the spring where the citizens of the
city went for water, they encountered Melanthios, a goatherd, driving
goats into town.

This is an atom: 
Two servants followed, helping him.

This is an atom: 
As soon as he
saw Eumaios and his guest, he said: "Look!

This is an atom: 
Thou miserable
swineherd, whither dost thou take that worthless beggar, this
vagabond who rubs his shoulders on every door-post, asking for crusts,
eating gluttonously, and telling tales of woe?

This is an atom: 
"Just hand him over to me to guard my stables and clean my yard, and
I will give him whey to drink, which will fatten his limbs.

This is an atom: 
Let him once come to the palace
of Odysseus and the guests that woo the queen will fling footstools
at him.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus
hesitated a moment and considered whether it were better to slay the
goatherd with a blow from his staff, or whether he should submit to
the indignity in silence.

This is an atom: 
But Eumaios grew angry and said: "Melanthios, wait till Odysseus
returns.

This is an atom: 
All day long
dost thou loaf in the city, leaving thy master's flocks to take care
of themselves.

This is an atom: 
" Melanthios answered him: "Just hear what this cur
has to say!

This is an atom: 
I shall take him off and sell him for a slave some day.

This is an atom: 
Would that Telemachos might die this moment under the hands of the
suitors, and go down to Hades to join his father!

This is an atom: 
" With these words
he hurried off to the house of his master where he sat down among
the crowd of wooers.

This is an atom: 
As they drew
near they waited a little to listen to the music, for a minstrel had
begun a song, and while singing he played the lyre.

This is an atom: 
"Surely, Eumaios,"
said Odysseus, "anyone would know that this is the palace of a king.

This is an atom: 
See how stately the structure is, and how spacious the court beyond
the massive gates!

This is an atom: 
No one but Odysseus could have built such a fortress.

This is an atom: 
I hear the sound
of the lute and perceive the tempting odor of roasting meat, and there
are crowds of guests coming and going.

This is an atom: 
"

Eumaios replied: "True, my friend, this is the house of Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
As to the French _Encyclopédie_,
it is a book which I am desirous--very desirous--of possessing, and
if you could get me a few months' credit (being at present rather
low in cash), I should very much desire to have it.

This is an atom: 
My dear sir, excuse the earnestness of the first part of my letter.

This is an atom: 
I feel warmly on this subject, and I flatter myself that so long as
your own independence and liberty remain uncompromised, you are inclined
to second my desires.

This is an atom: 
PS.It was Argus, whom Odysseus
himself had raised before he went to Troy.

This is an atom: 
In times gone by, the young
men of Ithaca had made him most useful in the chase.

This is an atom: 
But now
that he was old no one cared for him, and he was left to die.

This is an atom: 
As soon as he saw Odysseus drawing near he pricked up his ears and
wagged his tail.

This is an atom: 
But he had not strength enough to get up and come
to his master, although he moved as if he would gladly have done so.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus saw this and burst into tears, but he turned his face away
in hopes that Eumaios would not notice it.

This is an atom: 
But the good swineherd saw it and so Odysseus questioned him: "Eumaios,
what dog is this that lies upon this filth?

This is an atom: 
"

"This dog, stranger," answered Eumaios, "belongs to my dear master.

This is an atom: 
If thou hadst only seen him before Odysseus went to Troy thou wouldst
have been astonished at his swiftness.

This is an atom: 
No wild animal was able to escape him.

This is an atom: 
"

The swineherd passed on into the hall where the suitors sat, but
Odysseus stood looking at the faithful beast, the only creature that
had recognized him.

This is an atom: 
The joy of seeing his old master was too great,
and Argus sank down and died.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLII
ODYSSEUS COMES, A BEGGAR, TO HIS OWN HOUSE


Telemachos was the first to notice the swineherd entering the hall,
and he made a sign for him to come and sit by him.

This is an atom: 
Presently Odysseus,
too, entered in the guise of a forlorn old beggar, and sat down near
the door.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos handed Eumaios a whole loaf of bread and as much
meat as he could hold in his two hands, and bade him take it to the
beggar.

This is an atom: 
And he told him to tell the poor old man to ask a pittance
from every suitor present.

This is an atom: 
Then he placed his food in a wallet
on the ground, and began to eat, while a minstrel entertained the
assembly with sweet music.

This is an atom: 
When the bard ceased his singing, the
suitors began a noisy conversation, and having a signal from Athena,
Odysseus arose and went from one wooer to another asking alms.

This is an atom: 
Melanthios, the goatherd, and the favorite of Eurymachos, wishing
to make mischief, told them that Eumaios had brought the old man along
but did not, himself, know who he was.

This is an atom: 
Antinoös hearing this, said:
"Eumaios, foolish swineherd, why didst thou bring that vile beggar
here?

This is an atom: 
"

Eumaios answered him most courteously: "Antinoös, though thou art
high born thou art not well bred.

This is an atom: 
Thou hast always spoken
contemptuously to all the servants of Odysseus, but chiefly to me.

This is an atom: 
But I heed not thy abuse so long as
I can serve the wise Penelope and her powerful son.

This is an atom: 
"

Then Telemachos, seeing that a quarrel was brewing, interposed: "Hold
thy peace, Eumaios, make no words with Antinoös.

This is an atom: 
Nothing pleases him more than to stir up ill-feeling.

This is an atom: 
Surely Antinoös, thou art a father to me when thou dost bid me turn
a stranger into the street and insult him.

This is an atom: 
Pray let the old beggar
approach thee and receive a pittance, for thou shouldst not feast
on the food belonging to others and never bestow any gifts.

This is an atom: 
All the
suitors except thyself have given him a dole.

This is an atom: 
"

Antinoös made response: "Telemachos, thou boaster, if each suitor
would bestow upon him such a gift as I will make, he would not come
here again very soon.

This is an atom: 
" With that he seized a footstool and held it
up where all could see it.

This is an atom: 
The beggar approached him with a pitiful
story of wanderings and hardships.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus withdrew, saying as he went: "How strange it is that so fine
a form can conceal so foul a mind.

This is an atom: 
Thou wouldst not give even salt
to a suppliant, nor a crust of bread from thine own table, without
begrudging it.

This is an atom: 
But thou dost feed gluttonously at the table of an
absent chief.

This is an atom: 
" Antinoös grew more angry, and rejoined: "Thou insolent
beggar, thou shalt not leave this hall unpunished.

This is an atom: 
" With that he
raised the footstool and struck Odysseus on the shoulder.

This is an atom: 
The chief
stood like a rock, not in the least disturbed.

This is an atom: 
But he made menacing
motions with his head and retired to the door, where he put down his
wallet and lifted up his voice to call down vengeance from the gods.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos saw the blow, and could hardly restrain his anger.

This is an atom: 
Word
was carried to Penelope that a penniless stranger had been insulted
and struck in her halls, and she said to her maids: "I would that
Apollo with his bow might strike Antinoös down.

This is an atom: 
"

Then she called the swineherd to her apartment and said: "Bring the
beggar hither.

This is an atom: 
"

The swineherd took the queen's message to the stranger, but he begged
that he might not comply with the request until the suitors had left
the house.

This is an atom: 
"I knew Odysseus well," he said, "but I dread these violent
men.

This is an atom: 
Therefore, ask Penelope to let me wait until sunset when I can
sit by the fire and warm myself, and tell her all that she shall
inquire.

This is an atom: 
"

The queen thought the beggar's answer was a prudent one, and was
satisfied.

This is an atom: 
The suitors kept up the revel until late in the evening, and
then went home leaving Odysseus in his own palace.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLIII
CONVERSATION OF ODYSSEUS AND PENELOPE


After the revellers had left the palace, Odysseus said to his son:
"Now is the time to hide all these weapons where the suitors cannot
find them, when their hour of need shall come.

This is an atom: 
If they ask for them
tell them that the arms were losing their polish in these smoky rooms,
and also that the gods had warned thee to remove them since some
dispute might arise in which the wooers heated with wine and anger
would attack each other.

This is an atom: 
He called his old nurse to see that the
servants were in their own apartments and the doors of the palace
made fast while he removed the arms to an upper room.

This is an atom: 
Then he retired
to rest, leaving Odysseus sitting by the hearth in the large
dining-hall awaiting the arrival of Penelope.

This is an atom: 
She was not long in
coming.

This is an atom: 
Her maids placed a chair, inlaid with silver and ivory, for
her near the fire, and threw a large woolly rug before it for her
feet.

This is an atom: 
The queen, stately as a goddess, took her seat there while her maids
carried away the dishes and food left by the suitors.

This is an atom: 
Then Melantho, an impudent maid, said to
Odysseus: "Art thou here, thou beggar!

This is an atom: 
It is true that I
am ragged, but I am not unclean.

This is an atom: 
But it pleased the
gods to make me poor.

This is an atom: 
Thou pert woman, surely the queen, Penelope,
never taught thee, and thy bad conduct will not escape the eye of
Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
"

Penelope saw and heard all this and the high-breeding of the beggar
did not escape her keen notice.

This is an atom: 
Thou dost know full well that
this stranger has remained here at my own request, that I might inquire
if he knows aught of my husband.

This is an atom: 
"

Then the queen asked her matron to spread a rug for the poor old man.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus sat down and Penelope began to question him.

This is an atom: 
"Who art thou,
stranger?

This is an atom: 
"
Odysseus answered her: "My gracious queen, I am the son of a king
and I come from Crete.

This is an atom: 
But do not ask me of these things, for I do not wish to lament over
unhappy days.

This is an atom: 
"Strong ties of friendship bind me to Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
Twenty years ago,
when he went to Troy, I received him as a guest in my house, because
contrary winds and a stormy sea had thrown him upon my island.

This is an atom: 
I led
him to my palace and gave him the best of food and wine.

This is an atom: 
Twelve days
he remained with me, both himself and his companions.

This is an atom: 
On the
thirteenth a favorable wind arose and they went on to Troy.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus kept on inventing one tale after another, such as might seem
probable, and the tears rolled down Penelope's cheeks.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus could
have wept, too, when he saw how deep her loyalty and affection were
rooted.

This is an atom: 
The lady had no doubt of the genuine character of her guest,
but she cautiously strove to prove the truth of his words, so she
questioned him yet farther, asking him to describe Odysseus and his
comrades--how he looked and what dress he wore.

This is an atom: 
Besides this he
had on a delicate tunic of shining cloth, spun, doubtless, by his
queen, for the women gazed at it in wonder.

This is an atom: 
"He was accompanied by a herald named Eurybates, a hunchback with
a dark complexion, but Odysseus seemed to value him above all the
rest, for he was a clever and a faithful man.

This is an atom: 
"

When Odysseus had finished speaking, Penelope exclaimed, with a burst
of passionate grief: "Stranger, I was moved to pity when I first saw
thee in my halls, but thou shalt be held as an honored guest from
this time forward.

This is an atom: 
Thou hast spoken truly of the garments, for I shaped
the folds in them myself and put on the clasps.

This is an atom: 
I met him lately on his homeward way,
laden with wealth which he had gathered in the country of the
Thesprotians.

This is an atom: 
"He will come alone, for his comrades were destroyed off the island
of Trinacria, for they had slain the oxen of the Sun.

This is an atom: 
He would have
arrived here before me, only that he stopped to consult an oracle
whether to come secretly or not.

This is an atom: 
He is safe and will not long remain
away from thee.

This is an atom: 
"

The wise queen answered him: "I would that thy words might prove true,
O stranger, but the thought is deep in my heart that Odysseus is no
more.

This is an atom: 
My maidens, lead this guest to the bath and spread a couch for
him where he can rest quietly, and to-morrow he shall share the morning
meal with Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
"

Then said Odysseus to her: "Fair queen, I care not for fine covers
and soft beds.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XLIV
EURYCLEIA RECOGNIZES ODYSSEUS


Penelope admired the prudence of the poor old beggar, and called
Eurycleia, bidding her to bathe the stranger's feet as carefully as
if they were the feet of her master.

This is an atom: 
The nurse filled a bright brass
basin with warm water and knelt down to execute the command of her
royal mistress, saying: "My poor Odysseus!

This is an atom: 
Who knows but he may be wandering like thee, weary and footsore!

This is an atom: 
"Stranger, I will wash thy feet for the sake of my absent master,
and to please that gracious queen who has commanded me to do so; but
most of all because thou art in need of it through suffering.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus replied: "It has often been said that I look like Odysseus
by those who knew us both, O aged dame.

This is an atom: 
" Then he turned his feet away
from the light, for fear that Eurycleia would recognize a scar and
discover who he was.

This is an atom: 
But it was in vain, for as soon as she passed
her hand over it she knew it.

This is an atom: 
It was a scar that came where a wild
boar had once torn the flesh when Odysseus was hunting on Parnassos.

This is an atom: 
The old servant was so overcome with joy that she laughed and cried
at the same time.

This is an atom: 
She let his foot fall against the basin, which was
upset with a loud clang, while the water was spilled over the floor.

This is an atom: 
She laid her hand on Odysseus' beard, and said in a voice trembling
with emotion: "Dear son, thou art Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
"

Then Eurycleia turned to tell Penelope that her lord had come, for
the queen had not seen the upsetting of the basin.

This is an atom: 
But Odysseus laid
his finger on the old servant's lips, and with his left hand drew
her closer and said: "Be silent.

This is an atom: 
Let no one know that I have come,
for I must slay the suitors by stratagem.

This is an atom: 
If they know that I am here
they will prevent me and destroy us all.

This is an atom: 
She bathed
his feet and anointed them.

This is an atom: 
And he moved to the fire and took his
seat, while he pulled his ragged garments over the scar to hide it,
lest it might betray him.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLV
PENELOPE'S DREAM


When Odysseus was again seated by the hearth, Penelope began to speak
to him further: "Stranger, one more question I must ask thee, and
then I will leave thee, for the hour of sleep is near.

This is an atom: 
All day long
I keep at my tasks to try to forget my grief, for the gods have visited
me with sore misfortunes.

This is an atom: 
But when night comes strange dreams flit through my
mind, and new sorrows spring up in my heart.

This is an atom: 
"There are from day to day assembled in my home all the young men
of the best families of Ithaca and the neighboring isles, who insist
that I shall choose one of them for a husband.

This is an atom: 
But as I am not willing
to comply, they remain in my house and destroy my property.

This is an atom: 
I am not
able to drive them out, and do not know how to help myself.

This is an atom: 
"I dreamt that there was a flock of twenty geese in my court-yard,
and they picked corn out of the water and ate greedily.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly an
eagle swooped down upon them from above and broke their necks and
tore them to pieces.

This is an atom: 
Then he flew off, leaving them scattered about
the yard.

This is an atom: 
I bitterly bewailed the loss of my geese, and so did my
maids.

This is an atom: 
After awhile the eagle came back and, perching on the roof,
said to me: 'Take courage, Penelope, this is no dream.

This is an atom: 
The geese are
the wooers, but I, the eagle, am thy husband, and I have come to kill
those impudent robbers that vex thee.

This is an atom: 
'"

Odysseus answered her: "The eagle gave the right explanation, O lady.

This is an atom: 
The dream could not have had any other meaning.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus will come
and slay the wooers, and not one shall escape him.

This is an atom: 
"

"Dreams do not always come to pass," rejoined Penelope, "but I
heartily wish that this might be fulfilled.

This is an atom: 
To-morrow is a decisive day, for
it may be the one that drives me from the palace.

This is an atom: 
Through the rings of the handles
he shot an arrow, although he stood at a great distance.

This is an atom: 
I will
challenge the suitors to take the same bow and send the arrow through
the rings as Odysseus did.

This is an atom: 
He who succeeds shall lead me forth a bride,
to his own palace.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus will
be at hand a long time before any of the suitors can bend his bow.

This is an atom: 
"

"Thy words, O stranger, are comforting," said Penelope.

This is an atom: 
But as thou art in need of rest, I will
retire to my apartment, and the maids shall spread rugs before the
fire for thee.

This is an atom: 
" Penelope, having said this, went up to her room, her
maids following her, and she wept, thinking of her royal lord, until
Athena closed her eyes in sleep.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLVI
ATHENA ENCOURAGES ODYSSEUS


Odysseus was lying on his bed, but he could not sleep, for he was
thinking how he might destroy the suitors.

This is an atom: 
Thou art in
thine own house and near thy wife and child.

This is an atom: 
" "All this is true, O
goddess," answered Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
"

"Sleep in peace, Odysseus," returned Athena.

This is an atom: 
The time has come when all thy sufferings
shall end.

This is an atom: 
" Thus spoke the goddess, and, closing his eyelids with sweet
slumber, she flew up to Olympos.

This is an atom: 
While Odysseus was sleeping, his wife had waked, and, sitting on her
bed, addressed a prayer to Artemis: "Rather let me die, O goddess,
than become the wife of any other man than Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
I was so glad that I
could not believe that it was not a reality.

This is an atom: 
He arose and hastily placed
the rugs on which he had slept on a bench in the palace.

This is an atom: 
Then he went
out into the open air.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos had risen also, and he went forth
to the market-place.

This is an atom: 
Eurycleia called the servants together and
ordered them to be quick about their work, for a festival was to be
celebrated that day and the wooers would come early.

This is an atom: 
The servants of the suitors came also and cut
wood for the fires.

This is an atom: 
He saluted Odysseus and asked him if he were well treated by the
suitors, or if they continued to scoff at him.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus answered him:
"May the gods punish the ruthless men who perpetrate such wrongs in
a stranger's home.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus took no notice of it, except to shake his head as one who
plans direful things.

This is an atom: 
The master herdsman now came along with a fat heifer and choice goats
for the day's banquet.

This is an atom: 
Offering his hand to Odysseus, he exclaimed:
"Hail to thee, stranger!

This is an atom: 
Methinks
my master must be clothed in rags and wandering like thee.

This is an atom: 
Thou dost
bring his image to my mind.

This is an atom: 
I hope he may return and drive these suitors
out of his palace.

This is an atom: 
" "Be sure that he will come, herdsman; thou wilt
see him with thine own eyes, when he slays the ruthless suitors, and
then thou wilt know who is lord of the palace," replied Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
The suitors were talking apart from the rest and conspiring to take
the life of Telemachos, when an eagle wheeled over their heads,
tearing a timid dove.

This is an atom: 
With hearts foreboding ill at this omen, they
went into the hall to begin the banquet, while the herdsman went his
way first saying, "When Odysseus comes, call on me, and I will show
how strong my arm is to deal a blow at his enemies.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XLVII
THE LAST BANQUET OF THE SUITORS


The suitors had now arrived in the great banquet-hall and taken their
places at the tables.

This is an atom: 
The servants brought bread and meat and placed
it before them, while Melanthios filled their goblets with wine.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos placed Odysseus near the door, and gave him an ample supply
of food, saying: "Eat and drink, stranger, without fear.

This is an atom: 
None of the
wooers shall assail thee, for I will stand guard.

This is an atom: 
"

One of the suitors, an evil-minded man with a rich father, said to
his companions: "My friends, this stranger enjoys his meal greatly.

This is an atom: 
It does not become any one of us to begrudge good things to the guests
of Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
I, too, wish to give him a present, which he in turn
may bestow on some other beggar.

This is an atom: 
" With that he seized an ox's foot
and hurled it at Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos grew angry
and rebuked the suitor in these words: "Ktesippos, thou hast escaped
death.

This is an atom: 
It is well that this stranger avoided thy blow, for if thou
hadst struck him, my sharp spear would have pinned thee to the wall,
and thy father would have prepared a burial instead of a wedding for
thee.

This is an atom: 
"

Dreadful forebodings of woe began to fill the hearts of the suitors.

This is an atom: 
Penelope now entered the great hall and took her seat upon a
magnificent throne, right in front of the suitors.

This is an atom: 
She heard the
maudlin laughter and saw the gluttonous feasting as the revel ran
high.

This is an atom: 
Then Athena came and moved her mind to immediate action, and
she went up to the farthest chamber with her maids, where the arms
of Odysseus were stored.

This is an atom: 
To-morrow you will live, you always cry; In what far country does this
morrow lie, That 'tis so mighty long ere it arrive?

This is an atom: 
'Tis so far-fetched, this morrow, that I fear 'Twill be both very
old and very dear.

This is an atom: 
To-morrow I will live, the fool does say; To-day itself's too late,
the wise lived yesterday.

This is an atom: 
Wonder not, sir (you who instruct the town In the true wisdom of
the sacred gown), That I make haste to live, and cannot hold Patiently
out, till I grow rich and old.

This is an atom: 
Life for delays and doubts no time does give, None ever yet made
haste enough to live.

This is an atom: 
Let him defer it, whose preposterous care Omits himself, and reaches
to his heir, Who does his father's bounded stores despise, And
whom his own, too, never can suffice:
My humble thoughts no glittering roofs require, Or rooms that shine
with ought be constant fire.

This is an atom: 
We ill content the avarice of my sight With the fair gildings of
reflected light:
Pleasures abroad, the sport of Nature yields Her living fountains,
and her smiling fields:
And then at home, what pleasure is 't to see A little cleanly,
cheerful family?

This is an atom: 
It is a hard and nice subject for a man to write of himself; it
grates his own heart to say anything of disparagement and the
reader's ears to hear anything of praise for him.

This is an atom: 
There is no danger from me of offending him in this kind; neither
my mind, nor my body, nor my fortune allow me any materials for that
vanity.

This is an atom: 
It is sufficient for my own contentment that they have preserved
me from being scandalous, or remarkable on the defective side.

This is an atom: 
But besides
that, I shall here speak of myself only in relation to the subject
of these precedent discourses, and shall be likelier thereby to
fall into the contempt than rise up to the estimation of most people.

This is an atom: 
As far as my memory can return back into my past life, before I knew
or was capable of guessing what the world, or glories, or business
of it were, the natural affections of my soul gave me a secret bent
of aversion from them, as some plants are said to turn away from
others, by an antipathy imperceptible to themselves and inscrutable
to man's understanding.

This is an atom: 
Even when I was a very young boy at school, instead of running about
on holidays and playing with my fellows, I was wont to steal from
them and walk into the fields, either alone with a book, or with
some one companion, if I could find any of the same temper.

This is an atom: 
I was
then, too, so much an enemy to all constraint, that my masters could
never prevail on me, by any persuasions or encouragements, to learn
without book the common rules of grammar, in which they dispensed
with me alone, because they found I made a shift to do the usual
exercises out of my own reading and observation.And now that
you may surely recognize me I will show you the scar made by a boar
on Parnassos.

This is an atom: 
They recognized their long-lost master, and threw their
arms around him and wept, and kissed his hands and feet.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus begged them to desist, lest the suitors should notice it
and discover him.

This is an atom: 
And he instructed them to bring the bow to him and
place it in his hands, after all the wooers had failed to bend it.

This is an atom: 
And he told them to shut and lock the doors, so that the maid-servants
could not hear the groans of the dying men, for they might run out
and warn the town.

This is an atom: 
He was vexed beyond measure, and said: "It is not
that I care for Penelope, for there are other women that would suit
me just as well, but if we are weaker than Odysseus our sons will
hear of it in future times and be ashamed of us.

This is an atom: 
"

Antinoös took up the word: "Eurymachos," he said, "this is a day held
sacred to Apollo, god of the silver bow.

This is an atom: 
No one will dare to touch them.

This is an atom: 
Let Melanthios bring goats,
and we will offer up sacrifices to the god and invite his aid.

This is an atom: 
Then
we shall have strength to win in this struggle.

This is an atom: 
The heralds filled their
cups with wine, and the wise Odysseus waited until they had drunk
to their hearts' content.

This is an atom: 
Then he lifted up his voice and said: "Hear me, ye suitors of Penelope,
while I advise that you defer this trial of your strength until another
day.

This is an atom: 
Apollo will then bestow the power on one of you to triumph over
the others.

This is an atom: 
Let me practise with the bow to-day, to see if I have
any of my youthful strength, or if I have lost it through suffering
and want.

This is an atom: 
"Thou senseless
beggar," said Antinoös, "is it not enough that we allow thee to sit
at a banquet with the proudest men alive?

This is an atom: 
Verily
we would sell thee for a slave to the great enemy of men.

This is an atom: 
"

Then said Penelope: "Indeed, Antinoös, it is not large-minded to deny
this poor old man the pleasure of trying the bow.

This is an atom: 
"Dost thou think I would go forth as the wife of a beggar?

This is an atom: 
Nay, the
stranger has no hope of that.

This is an atom: 
"

Eurymachos, the leading suitor, rejoined: "Our care is not that thou
wilt wed this man.

This is an atom: 
But we fear the ridicule of the people, who will
say, 'These are great men, indeed, who are outdone in strength and
skill by a miserable old beggar.

This is an atom: 
"

"Nay, Eurymachos," replied Penelope, "real shame comes on him who
robs a good man and brings trouble to his family.

This is an atom: 
This beggar claims
to be of good blood, and his arm is sinewy.

This is an atom: 
I
make a solemn promise that if Apollo grant him the honor of bending
the bow, I shall do no less than bestow upon him a tunic and a cloak,
and sandals, and I will give him a sword with which he can defend
himself.

This is an atom: 
Then he can go where he likes.

This is an atom: 
"

Telemachos saw that the great crisis was at hand.

This is an atom: 
"Mother," he said,
"it rests with me to give the bow or withhold it.

This is an atom: 
Such matters belong
to men, and in this palace the authority is mine.

This is an atom: 
Take thy maids,
then, and retire to thy apartments, and ply the tasks most suitable
to women.

This is an atom: 
"

The queen recognized her son's wisdom, and withdrew with her maids
to the upper rooms.

This is an atom: 
There she wept for the beloved monarch, her absent
lord, until Athena sent a soothing sleep to comfort her.

This is an atom: 
The suitors laughed to hear
the young man's voice ring out like a trumpet and drown all other
noises.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus took the bow and turned it from side to side,
examining it in every part.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos, in a low tone, bade Eurycleia
make fast all the doors, and the master herdsman tied the gates of
the outer court with a ship's cable.

This is an atom: 
The suitors grew uneasy, and one of them said to another: "See the
beggar, how he turns the bow this way and that!

This is an atom: 
He would have us think
that he is an expert in the use of bows.

This is an atom: 
He put it to his ear to try its
tenseness as a minstrel tunes his harp.

This is an atom: 
It screamed like
a swallow and went through every ring from the first one to the last.

This is an atom: 
He sprang to the threshold with his bow in hand
and a quiver full of arrows at his side, and shouted: "The contest
is ended.

This is an atom: 
"

Antinoös had just put a golden goblet to his lips, and was about to
drink the delicious wine.

This is an atom: 
He dropped
the cup and fell to the ground, and as he fell his feet struck the
table.

This is an atom: 
The spears were gone, and the lances and all the armor.

This is an atom: 
Even yet they were blind to the fact that the stranger had slain
Antinoös purposely.

This is an atom: 
"Fool," they said, "what
art thou doing?

This is an atom: 
Thou hast slain the
noblest man in Ithaca.

This is an atom: 
Never
again shalt thou be allowed a trial with the bow.

This is an atom: 
"

"Dogs," cried Odysseus, "ye little thought your chief would ever
return from Troy, and therefore ye have robbed me of my wealth and
vexed my wife with offers of marriage, regardless of the laws of god
and man.

This is an atom: 
"If
thou art indeed Odysseus, thou hast good cause to complain of wrongs,"
he said.

This is an atom: 
"But thou hast slain the leader, Antinoös, who prompted us
to do these wrongs.

This is an atom: 
He wanted
to gain thy land and rule over thy people.

This is an atom: 
Spare the rest of us and
we will make ample restitution.

This is an atom: 
"

A dreadful frown spread over Odysseus' face, and he replied:
"Eurymachos, I will not take thy wealth nor will I spare thy life.

This is an atom: 
Now choose between the two, either to fight or fly from death.

This is an atom: 
Hold up the tables for shields,
and rush upon him, all of you, at once.

This is an atom: 
Drive him out of the gates,
and then hurry through the city and give a general alarm.

This is an atom: 
A deadly arrow from the famous bow met him and he
fell upon the table, upsetting it, and he went spinning round with
it on the paved floor, while the food and cup of wine were scattered
all about.

This is an atom: 
His head struck upon a stone and his feet against a chair.

This is an atom: 
Then Telemachos sprang to his
father's side and said: "My father, I will bring thee javelins and
a shield, and I will arm myself and the swineherd and the master
herdsmen.

This is an atom: 
" "Make haste, my son," responded Odysseus, "for I have but
few arrows left.

This is an atom: 
"

Telemachos hastened to the room where the arms had been stored and
clothed himself in brass.

This is an atom: 
His loyal herdsmen also put on splendid
armor, and they hastened back to Odysseus with a complete outfit for
him.

This is an atom: 
The chief had used up his arrows, and now he dressed himself
in armor and took the lances.

This is an atom: 
Just then he perceived that the suitors
had by some means been supplied with armor also.

This is an atom: 
He called to
Telemachos, who had left the door ajar leading to the apartment where
the arms had been placed for safety.

This is an atom: 
Melanthios, the goatherd, had sneaked in and was slyly bringing
shields and helmets down to them.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos saw him, and gave orders
to the herdsmen to lock the doors of the armory and secure the spy.

This is an atom: 
They cast him on the floor and tied his arms down
so that he could not move them.

This is an atom: 
Then they took a rope and made two
loops in it and swung him safely to the timbers in the roof, saying:
"Melanthios, thou hast a soft bed, and it is where thou canst keep
watch.

This is an atom: 
In the morning thou canst drive thy goats to the suitors'
banquet.

This is an atom: 
" They locked the doors and left him there and took their
places at Odysseus' side.

This is an atom: 
"Woe unto thee, Mentor, if thou
dost dare to help Odysseus," cried one of the suitors.

This is an atom: 
But their aim was uncertain, and they struck pillars
and panels and the wall, for the goddess turned their shafts aside.

This is an atom: 
The cowherd struck
Ktesippos in the breast and exclaimed, as the suitor fell: "Ktesippos,
I give thee this spear in exchange for the ox's foot which thou didst
throw at Odysseus as a gift when he asked alms of thee.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus rushed in upon them and cut them down right
and left, while Athena from above shook her fearful ægis.

This is an atom: 
The
surviving wooers were stricken with terror and ran about like a herd
of oxen chased by a swarm of gadflies.

This is an atom: 
Both of them had served the suitors
most unwillingly and had secretly advised with Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus searched up and down the hall to see if any suitor could
be found alive.

This is an atom: 
As fishes lie upon the beach when they have been poured
out from the nets upon the sand, so lay the multitude of wooers.

This is an atom: 
Then Odysseus called Eurycleia and bade her summon all of the impudent
and unfaithful servants who had taken sides with the suitors.

This is an atom: 
They
came into the hall and with loud laments took up the slain and carried
them out as they were commanded, and placed them in a walled court.

This is an atom: 
Then they cleaned the hall with water and sponges, and polished the
wood and set everything in order.

This is an atom: 
When this was done, they were driven like a flock of birds into a
narrow place outside and hung to a beam to die wretchedly.

This is an atom: 
Melanthios
also was brought down from the armory and cast among the dogs to die.

This is an atom: 
The palace now was purged with the smoke of sulphur, and the air was
purified with incense.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER L
EURYCLEIA ANNOUNCES THE RETURN OF ODYSSEUS TO PENELOPE


Eurycleia, with an exulting heart, now hurried up the lofty stairs
and stood by the queen in her royal chamber.

This is an atom: 
" Prudent Penelope answered her: "Eurycleia, thou
art mad.

This is an atom: 
If any other maid had come on such an errand and waked
me from sleep, I would have dismissed her with anger.

This is an atom: 
"

"Nay, dear child, I do not mock thee; Odysseus has come and is now
sitting by the hearth.

This is an atom: 
"Tell me, dear nurse," she said, "tell me truly, if in fact my husband
has returned, how was it possible that he alone could destroy such
a multitude of haughty men!

This is an atom: 
" "I did not see it," responded the old
nurse, "but I heard the groans of the dying men as I sat with the
other maids in our own rooms.

This is an atom: 
When Telemachos called me, I found Odysseus surrounded by
the slain.

This is an atom: 
When we had washed the hall and purged it with smoke and
purified the air with incense, thy husband ordered me to call thee.

This is an atom: 
Follow me now, my child, that your heart may be gladdened after it
has been oppressed so long with sorrows.

This is an atom: 
"

Penelope replied again: "Nay, I cannot believe it.

This is an atom: 
The gods may have
slain the suitors under the guise of Odysseus, but he has perished
far away from home and never will return.

This is an atom: 
I
recognized Odysseus myself by the well-known scar made by the boar's
tusk.

This is an atom: 
I turned to tell thee, but he laid his finger on my lips and
said: 'Be silent.

This is an atom: 
Let no one know that I am here until the suitors
all are slain, or else they will destroy me.

This is an atom: 
I pledge
my life that I speak the truth.

This is an atom: 
She crossed the threshold and sat down at the hearth, opposite
Odysseus, who was seated beside a stately column in the blazing light
of the fire.

This is an atom: 
He did not lift his eyes to look at his wife, but waited
for her to make the way open for him to speak.

This is an atom: 
She looked at her husband and seemed sometimes to recognize him, and
then the resemblance faded out and he did not seem at all like
Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
Any other woman would
extend a hearty welcome to her husband after he had suffered so many
years of hardship, wandering in foreign lands.

This is an atom: 
" "My son," answered Penelope, "I seem to have lost the power
to speak.

This is an atom: 
I am dazed and cannot even command myself to look at him.

This is an atom: 
If this is indeed Odysseus we soon shall know each other, for there
are secrets known to us two only.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus smiled and said: "My son, be patient, and let thy mother
put me to the test.

This is an atom: 
She does not know me in these rags, but she will
soon be convinced that I am Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
Who knows but what they may rise
up against us.

This is an atom: 
I deem it best that we bathe and put on fresh garments,
and let the servants do the same.

This is an atom: 
"And let the minstrel bring his lyre and strike up such music as
prompts the dance, so that those living near us may report that a
wedding is being celebrated.

This is an atom: 
Then we may safely venture forth and
see what is to be done.

This is an atom: 
"

Thus spoke the monarch, and his commands were gladly obeyed.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos and the servants went their way to the baths and arrayed
themselves in splendid clothing.

This is an atom: 
The bard took his harp and woke the
pleasing strains, and the palace halls resounded with mirth and
dancing.

This is an atom: 
She weds a second time, and does not even know whether her absent
lord is dead or living.

This is an atom: 
"

Meantime Odysseus followed a servant to the bath, and when he had
been bathed and anointed he put on garments suitable for a king.

This is an atom: 
Athena
gave him a more majestic appearance, and caused his hair to fall in
heavy curls, like the petals of the hyacinth.

This is an atom: 
When he came back to
the great hall and stood before the queen, he looked like an immortal.

This is an atom: 
"Lady," he said, "the gods have given thee a stubborn heart.

This is an atom: 
Any other
woman would have given a glad welcome to her husband after he had
been absent twenty years.

This is an atom: 
" To this Penelope responded: "Not so; I
have no pride nor a cold heart.

This is an atom: 
But I should be unworthy of my lord
if I accepted a stranger without putting him to the proof.

This is an atom: 
Thou didst command Eurycleia to carry
thy massive bed out into the open air and cover it with fleeces.

This is an atom: 
"

"Nay, woman, no living man could perform such a feat.

This is an atom: 
Round it I built a royal bower, and, cutting off the
great limbs of the tree, shaped them and fastened them to the trunk.

This is an atom: 
In this wise I built the frame, and no one could move it without
dragging the tree out by the roots.

This is an atom: 
That is a secret known only to
thee and me.

This is an atom: 
"

Penelope had put the final test, and knew that this was surely Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
She rose from where she sat and ran to him and threw her arms about
his neck and kissed his brow.

This is an atom: 
"Odysseus, do not be angry with me,"
she said.

This is an atom: 
"Many are they who have tried to practise deception upon
me.

This is an atom: 
" These words pierced Odysseus'
heart and brought him the relief of tears.

This is an atom: 
He pressed his faithful
wife to his bosom again and again.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER LI
ODYSSEUS VISITS HIS FATHER


Early the next morning Odysseus dressed himself in his splendid armor
and bade his son and servants accompany him to the farm.

This is an atom: 
They took
their weapons and went forth, Odysseus leading the way.

This is an atom: 
It was not
long before they came to the green fields which were cared for by
Laertes.

This is an atom: 
He had built his house there, and surrounded it with cabins,
where his servants slept.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus was anxious to know whether his father would recognize him
or not, so he said to one of the men: "Go into the house and call
my father.

This is an atom: 
There were no servants about, for they had all gone off
to gather thorns with which to build a fence.

This is an atom: 
There Odysseus saw his father working around a young tree that he
had just planted.

This is an atom: 
He was clad in old, coarse clothes that had been
repeatedly patched, a goat-skin cap, and gloves to protect his hands
from the briers.

This is an atom: 
It was pitiful to see the want of hope in the old man's face as he
moved about brooding over his troubles.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus was uncertain
whether he should throw his arms about his father's neck and clasp
him to his heart and kiss him, or whether it were better to question
him.

This is an atom: 
He approached Laertes gently and, having greeted him, said: "My friend,
thou art a skilful farmer.

This is an atom: 
Thy face does not look like the face of a
servant.

This is an atom: 
I desire to
learn what became of Odysseus, the son of Laertes.

This is an atom: 
He was once my
guest and one that I made most welcome.

This is an atom: 
The land is full of wicked men,
and there is no host to load thee with generous gifts, a recompense
for thy hospitality.

This is an atom: 
Oh, tell me of my son; when did he lodge with
thee?

This is an atom: 
The beasts and birds have long since devoured him.

This is an atom: 
No mother folded his shroud about him, nor did his father or his loyal
wife weep upon his bier.

This is an atom: 
How didst thou come here?

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus was overcome with pity, and invented a tale to prepare
Laertes for his unexpected coming.

This is an atom: 
Then he clasped the dear old man
in his arms and kissed his trembling hands, and said: "I am thy son,
my father; I am the Odysseus of whom thou dost inquire.

This is an atom: 
And for further
proof I will tell thee of the orchard-trees thou gavest me when I
was a child.

This is an atom: 
Forbear thy weeping and cease to mourn.

This is an atom: 
I have slain
the suitor-robbers who were destroying my riches, and I have taken
possession of my house again.

This is an atom: 
The
sturdy chieftain, Odysseus, saw it and drew him to his heart to keep
him from fainting, and held him there until his strength came back.

This is an atom: 
Then they went up to the house, where a supper had been prepared,
and Telemachos was waiting.

This is an atom: 
The grief had left his face, and he took on his
old majestic appearance.

This is an atom: 
As they sat at the banquet, relating the
experiences of the past years, Dolius and his sons, the servants who
had gone in search of thorns, returned.

This is an atom: 
Dolius recognized Odysseus
and seized him by the hand and saluted him with joyful greetings,
and his sons gathered round the chieftain eager to take his hand.

This is an atom: 
Hermes led them, and they followed, crying and wailing like bats in
a dark cave.

This is an atom: 
The shades of Achilles, Agamemnon, Ajax, and other heroes
saw them and constrained them to relate the mishaps that had brought
them there.

This is an atom: 
"

Ere Odysseus and Laertes had finished their feast, the news of the
dreadful death of the suitors spread over the city.

This is an atom: 
The wooers had
many friends, and they came to the palace weeping and mourning, ready
to avenge their slaughter.

This is an atom: 
Finding that Odysseus was not at home,
they proceeded to the market-place.

This is an atom: 
The father of Antinoös arose and
lifted up his voice crying for vengeance, but Medon, the herald,
warned them that a god had taken part against them and that strife
would be useless.

This is an atom: 
Halitherses, a wise and reverend citizen, took up the word: "Ye men
of Ithaca," he said, "give ear to what I have to say.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus was
not the cause of your misfortunes, but you, yourselves.

This is an atom: 
Ye would not

 XLVIII.

This is an atom: 
On the 14th of July the queen escaped from Falmouth to Brest.

This is an atom: 
After some rest at the baths of Bourbon, she went on to Paris, where
she was lodged in the Louvre, and well cared for.

This is an atom: 
Jermyn was still her treasurer, her minister, and the friend for
whose counsel she cared most.

This is an atom: 
It was into the service of this Lord Jermyn that Cowley had been
introduced through his friendship with the Herveys.

This is an atom: 
He went to Paris as Lord Jermyn's secretary, had charge of the
queen's political correspondence, ciphered and deciphered letters
between Queen Henrietta and King Charles, and was thus employed so
actively under Lord Jermyn that his work filled all his days, and
many of his nights.

This is an atom: 
He was sent also on journeys to Jersey, Scotland, Flanders, Holland,
or wherever else the king's troubles required his attendance.

This is an atom: 
In 1647 Cowley published his volume of forty-four love poems, called
"The Mistress.

This is an atom: 
"

                                                          He was himself
no gallant, neither paid court to ladies, nor married.

This is an atom: 
His love poetry was hypothetical; and of his life at this
           time he says: "Though I was in a crowd of as good company as could
be found anywhere; though I was in business of great and honourable
trust; though I ate at the best table, and enjoyed the best convenience
for present subsistence that ought to be desired by a man of my
condition in banishment and public distresses, yet I could not
abstain from renewing my old schoolboy's wish in a copy of verses
to the same effect:-
"'Well, then, I now do plainly see This busy world and I shall ne'er
agree,' &c.,
and I never then proposed to myself any other advantage from his
Majesty's happy restoration, but the getting into some moderately
convenient retreat in the country, which I thought, in that case,
I might easily have compassed, as well as some others who, with no
greater probabilities or pretences, have arrived to extraordinary
fortunes.

This is an atom: 
"

In 1654 Queen Henrietta, under influence of a new confessor, had
left the Louvre, and, with the little daughter born at Exeter, taken
up her quarters in a foundation of her own, at Chaillot, for nuns
of the visitation of St.

This is an atom: 
Mary.

This is an atom: 
Lord Jermyn having little use left for a secretary in Paris, Cowley
in 1656, after twelve years' service in France, was sent to England
that he might there live in the retirement he preferred, and with
the understanding that he would be able to send information upon
the course of home affairs.

This is an atom: 
In England he was presently seized by mistake for another man, and,
when his name and position were known, he was imprisoned, until a
friendly physician, Sir Charles Scarborough, undertook to be security
in a thousand pounds for his good conduct.

This is an atom: 
Their aim is the mental and ethical development of the pupils.

This is an atom: 
Reading
and writing lead but half way to this goal.

This is an atom: 
With all nations the
readers used in the public schools are a collection of the noblest
thoughts of their authors.

This is an atom: 
He continues:

"Happily the Greek nation, more than any other, abounds in literary
masterpieces.

This is an atom: 
They especially admire Homer's
works.

This is an atom: 
Nor does
he enjoy the stories of little children.

This is an atom: 
This is because his
imagination reaches out and beyond his environments.

This is an atom: 
Here all the domestic, civic, and religious virtues of
the people are marvellously brought to light and the national feeling
is exalted.

This is an atom: 
No other
ethical idea has such predominance as that of prowess.

This is an atom: 
MARY E. BURT.

This is an atom: 
There, about 1200 B.C., reigned a king by the name of Priam, possessed
of great power and boundless wealth.

This is an atom: 
He had many sons and daughters.

This is an atom: 
They were all handsome and heroic young men.

This is an atom: 
One of the youngest,
Paris, also named Alexandros, surpassed the others in beauty.

This is an atom: 
This happened to be the young royal shepherd, Paris.

This is an atom: 
So the three
goddesses floated down to the slope of Mount Ida on a snowy cloud
and placed the question before him, each promising to reward him
royally if he gave his verdict in her favor.

This is an atom: 
This was the chance which wily Aphrodite had contrived for Paris.

This is an atom: 
He took the hint and carried Helen away to his ship, together with
as much treasure as they could lay hands on, and then they sailed
for Troy.

This is an atom: 
Then his heart was filled with great wrath.

This is an atom: 
Only one of the kings
held back for awhile and needed much persuasion to join the league.

This is an atom: 
He chose for his companion the cunning Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
On
their arrival in Troy, Menelaos and Odysseus presented themselves
before Priam and demanded the return of Helen and the treasures.

This is an atom: 
There were eight young sparrows in the nest, nine birds
with the mother.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: ODYSSEUS AND MENELAOS PERSUADING AGAMEMNON TO
SACRIFICE IPHIGENEIA]

And now arose a favorable wind, and the Greeks arrived safely before
Troy.

This is an atom: 
He told a skilful carpenter to build a wooden horse of
gigantic size, and in it he hid the bravest Greek warriors.

This is an atom: 
what madness possesses you?

This is an atom: 
A deadly struggle took place between the Trojans and the Greeks.

This is an atom: 
Priam
was slain, and Paris and many other heroes.

This is an atom: 
The victory was to the
Greeks.

This is an atom: 
After their victory
at Troy they embarked in their ships and started eagerly for their
homes.

This is an atom: 
He became
reconciled to his wife, and they lived a quiet life far removed from
the enchantments of the wily Aphrodite.

This is an atom: 
But the
unfortunate Odysseus was delayed by the fair nymph Calypso on her
island, where she made her home in a cool and beautiful grotto.

This is an atom: 
There
he wept and mourned, desiring to see his wife again and his native
land.

This is an atom: 
Hermes
obeyed quickly.

This is an atom: 
He found her within the grotto, singing sweetly while she wove a fine
web on a golden loom.

This is an atom: 
When Hermes had gazed
upon these wonders he entered the grotto.

This is an atom: 
Calypso saw him as he came in and knew him.

This is an atom: 
Having given this message, he disappeared, leaving
Calypso in great grief.

This is an atom: 
The end of thy
grief has come.

This is an atom: 
Arise and prepare to depart for thy home.

This is an atom: 
Build thee
a raft of the trunks of trees which thou shalt hew down.

This is an atom: 
He sailed along in
this way seventeen days.

This is an atom: 
On the eighteenth he spied land in the
distance.

This is an atom: 
It was the land of the Phæacians, lying like a dark spot
off in the sea.

This is an atom: 
Then Poseidon, who was returning from Ethiopia, saw him, and his wrath
grew hot against the hero.

This is an atom: 
Behold!

This is an atom: 
Nevertheless, it is in my power to chastise him.

This is an atom: 
Am I to
bear more disasters?

This is an atom: 
With what dark clouds Zeus has shrouded the sky!

This is an atom: 
The storm grows wild.

This is an atom: 
What terrible waves are these!

This is an atom: 
Helplessly I
must perish.

This is an atom: 
Now I shall die an inglorious death.

This is an atom: 
The helm was wrung from his
hand and he fell into the angry breakers.

This is an atom: 
The mast was snapped in
two and the ropes and sails flew off into the sea.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus was under water a long time, striving in vain to come to
the surface.

This is an atom: 
Finally he rose, spitting the bitter brine out of his
mouth.

This is an atom: 
Battling bravely with the waves he reached it, and springing
on board sat down in the middle of it.

This is an atom: 
Thus he escaped death.

This is an atom: 
The angry waves tossed him hither and thither as the wind scatters
the leaves over a field.

This is an atom: 
why is Poseidon so angry
with thee?

This is an atom: 
Obey me
and thou shalt not suffer much longer.

This is an atom: 
Take my veil and wind it about thy breast, and thou shalt not have
anything to fear.

This is an atom: 
Then hurry away inland.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus hesitated to follow Ino's advice, fearing some treachery.

This is an atom: 
But Poseidon sent a huge wave which struck him and scattered the raft
as if it were dry chaff.

This is an atom: 
" Saying
this he lashed up his horses and drove off.

This is an atom: 
Whatever I may do, I see no help for
me.

This is an atom: 
Too tired to breathe or speak, he sank down in a swoon.

This is an atom: 
His knees
and arms trembled, and his whole body was bruised and swollen.

This is an atom: 
Near her lay two maids who served her.

This is an atom: 
In her dream the princess seemed to hear Athena say: "Nausicaä, why
art thou so slothful?

This is an atom: 
She found them in their splendid
hall.

This is an atom: 
Having finished the task, they took a bath and
anointed themselves with oil.

This is an atom: 
Then they sat down on the shore and
ate their lunch.

This is an atom: 
The repast over, they began to play ball.

This is an atom: 
First the white-armed
Nausicaä threw the ball.

This is an atom: 
Nausicaä sang a song as they frolicked on the sand.

This is an atom: 
Have
I reached a country where people dwell?

This is an atom: 
It seems to me I heard
cries of women.

This is an atom: 
Perhaps they were those of the nymphs who inhabit
the mountain heights, the springs of rivers, and the green meadows,
or those of people who live near by.

This is an atom: 
But I will see who they are.

This is an atom: 
He went in the direction of the voices, stalking along
like a great lion.

This is an atom: 
If, however, thou art a mortal,
thrice happy thy father and honored mother.

This is an atom: 
"I do not know one person in this country.

This is an atom: 
Athena shed a halo of beauty over him and
caused him to look taller and stronger than before.

This is an atom: 
I would that I might call a man like him my
husband.

This is an atom: 
The princess then yoked up the mules and they started for home.

This is an atom: 
Just follow close to the wagon with my maids.

This is an atom: 
After
thou hast seen us enter the city, then thou mayest enter it also and
inquire the way to the king's palace.

This is an atom: 
It is very beautiful.

This is an atom: 
Thou mayest
easily find it by thyself, for there is no other house in the city
as large as ours.

This is an atom: 
I am a stranger, and here for the first time.

This is an atom: 
Follow me, and I will lead thee thither.

This is an atom: 
"

Thus spoke Athena and pursued her way with Odysseus following her.

This is an atom: 
The first thing to do is to find
the queen, whose name is Aretè.

This is an atom: 
There were two rows of splendid seats in the large dining-hall.

This is an atom: 
There were fifty maid-servants in the palace.

This is an atom: 
There was a large orchard all around the palace, surrounded by a thick
hedge.

This is an atom: 
Some were blooming, others had
only begun to form fruit-buds, while some were loaded with ripe
clusters ready for the wine-press.

This is an atom: 
At the end of the orchard there
was a magnificent flower-garden, in which the most fragrant flowers
were blooming.

This is an atom: 
Two springs also bubbled from the ground.

This is an atom: 
One watered
the orchard, and the other ran to the very door of the palace, and
all the people filled their pitchers there.

This is an atom: 
May the gods give thee a long and happy
life.

This is an atom: 
"

Then Alkinoös arose and took Odysseus by the hand.

This is an atom: 
To-morrow we shall greet the stranger in our palace
with honors and offer a great sacrifice to the gods.

This is an atom: 
And then we will
consider the best way of sending him home.

This is an atom: 
Then they rose, and each man went to his own home.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus remained in the hall with Aretè and Alkinoös.

This is an atom: 
Who gave thee garments
of my weaving?

This is an atom: 
Yet I will do thy bidding.

This is an atom: 
"The goddess detained me seven long years on her island before she
bade me start for home.

This is an atom: 
"

"One duty my daughter left undone," Alkinoös said.

This is an atom: 
"She should have
brought thee home with her.

This is an atom: 
With a grateful heart Odysseus arose,
and, thanking the king for his generous hospitality, sought the bed,
where he gave himself to happy dreams.

This is an atom: 
Alkinoös then addressed the assembled multitude: "Hear me, ye chiefs
of the Phæacians," he said.

This is an atom: 
"This stranger has come to our land after
many wanderings and adventures.

This is an atom: 
And he asks me to send him back to
his own country.

This is an atom: 
Again the minstrel took his harp and sang, and again Odysseus wept.

This is an atom: 
Some of them darted over the
plain in a foot-race, raising a cloud of dust.

This is an atom: 
He had written an "Ode to Brutus," for which, said his
Majesty, it was enough for Mr.

This is an atom: 
Cowley to be forgiven.

This is an atom: 
to a brother of one of his mistresses.

This is an atom: 
Cowley certainly was too pure and thoughtful to be a fit associate
for Charles II.

This is an atom: 
and many of his friends.

This is an atom: 
The help that came from
the Earl of St.

This is an atom: 
Their style is simple, and their thoughts
are pure.

This is an atom: 
My house a cottage more Than palace, and should fitting be For all
my use, no luxury.

This is an atom: 
" 
H. M.
OF LIBERTY.

This is an atom: 
We do not boast that we are fine
boxers or wrestlers.

This is an atom: 
We excel in the dance and are unsurpassed in
sailing ships.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus looked on and
greatly admired the swift and rhythmical movements of their feet.

This is an atom: 
Then Odysseus said to Alkinoös: "Truly, no one
excels the Phæacian princes in dancing.

This is an atom: 
I see the twinkling of their
feet with amazement.

This is an atom: 
I am the thirteenth.

This is an atom: 
And let Euryalos,
who spoke such scoffing words to him, try to win back his friendship
and bring a costly gift.

This is an atom: 
Euryalos cheerfully obeyed the king.

This is an atom: 
"Stranger, farewell," she said.

This is an atom: 
"I wish thee joy and a safe return
to thy native land.

This is an atom: 
" Then Odysseus entered the great hall and
took his place at the feast.

This is an atom: 
He carries some
great trouble in his heart.

This is an atom: 
Let no grief mar our banquet.

This is an atom: 
Didst thou lose a noble kinsman there, or a dear friend?

This is an atom: 
For a friend is often dearer than a brother.

This is an atom: 
Around it are many smaller islands,
full of people.

This is an atom: 
It is a rugged
island, but it is the sweetest land on earth, and has a noble race
of mortals.

This is an atom: 
"We captured it and put the inhabitants to the sword.

This is an atom: 
They
fell upon our men and killed six of them from each ship, and drove
the rest back to their boats.

This is an atom: 
He forgets his cares and troubles,
but also his friends.

This is an atom: 
"We sailed about on unknown seas and with sorrowing hearts until we
came to the land of the Cyclops.

This is an atom: 
"As we looked around the cave we wondered at what we saw.

This is an atom: 
And there were pails full of whey, and buckets
of milk.

This is an atom: 
It was my wish to stay there and see
the cave-dweller and find out what kind of a man he was.

This is an atom: 
Having done this, he

This is an atom:

all been changed by Circè into swine?

our ship, and got everything in readiness to leave.

This is an atom: 
When they heard this they sat down, and wept, and began to
tear the hair from their heads.

This is an atom: 
There we left the ship and did those things
which Circè had counselled us to do.

This is an atom: 
We had left him dead in the halls
of the goddess, since we had no time to bury him.

This is an atom: 
Thou hast come more quickly on foot than I in my quick ship.

This is an atom: 
I drank too much
wine and that caused my death.

This is an atom: 
In my haste I fell from the roof and broke
my neck, and my soul came down to Hades.

This is an atom: 
I wept to see her, but
with a heavy heart I forbade her coming nearer until I had spoken
with Tiresias.

This is an atom:

Art thou
on thy way home from Troy?

"I answered her: 'Dear mother, I was compelled to come down here in
order to consult the soul of the prophet Tiresias about my return;
for I have not yet touched foot to Grecian soil.

This is an atom: 
Oh, tell me, my mother, how didst thou die?

This is an atom: 
Did
some lingering disease waste thy life, or didst thou meet a sudden,
painless death?

"'Tell me of my father and of my son.

This is an atom: 
Or has someone snatched it away from them, thinking I was
never to return?

This is an atom: 
Nobody has usurped thy kingdom, and Telemachos has charge of thy royal
estates.

his death at traitors' hands.

must be a man now.

This is an atom: 
Thou art a happy father.

This is an atom: 
Thou wilt see thy son
at home in Ithaca.

This is an atom: 
Tell me about him, I beseech thee,
how he is.

This is an atom: 
Does he still live in Sparta?

This is an atom: 
No one is happier than thou art, O Achilles.

This is an atom: 
But tell me, Odysseus, how fares
my noble son?

This is an atom: 
And Peleus, my aged father, tell me of him.

This is an atom: 
Is he still king of the
Myrmidons?

This is an atom:

"I answered him: 'I know nothing about thy aged father, O Achilles,
but I have many things to tell thee about thy son.

This is an atom: 
All the other leaders of the Greeks gave signs of fear.

This is an atom: 
They
grew white and shed tears; but his face never turned pale, and no
tear came into his eyes.

This is an atom: 
'

"As soon as Achilles heard this news he rejoiced.

This is an atom: 
For thou wast our tower of strength, and the weapons proved
fatal to thee.

This is an atom: 
Come nearer and speak to me, for I bewail thy death.

I spoke soothingly yet Ajax gave no answer.

among the other spirits.

This is an atom: 
With him I saw Tantalos, who stood in a pool
of water, suffering at the same time a painful thirst.

my comrades forth to bring the body of Elpenor from the palace.

This is an atom: 
But I sat down by Circè, who questioned
me about my visit to Hades.

This is an atom: 
Listen carefully to what I say.

This is an atom: 
Woe

"As the goddess finished, day broke.

This is an atom: 
No one ever yet passed us without
stopping and admiring our sweet songs.

This is an atom: 
But they sprang up and bound other cords
about me, so that I struggled in vain.

This is an atom: 
I
hastened from one end of the boat to the other, speaking cheerful
words to each rower.

This is an atom: 
'My dear friends,' I said, 'have no fear.

This is an atom: 
This
is not the first time we have encountered danger.

This is an atom: 
We have been saved
from the hands of the Cyclops through our own valor and clever devices,
and we are not going to break down now.

This is an atom: 
' Thus I spoke, and they willingly obeyed my words.

This is an atom: 
"We sailed on, the uproar increasing.

This is an atom: 
My men grew white with fear.

This is an atom: 
The rocks were hidden by a thick mist.

This is an atom: 
Woe is me!

This is an atom: 
I then made them take an oath not even to look at any of the
cattle.

This is an atom: 
But they grew poor and lean
with hunger and nearly starved.

This is an atom: 
There I fell asleep.

This is an atom: 
Let us kill the best of these cattle and
offer sacrifices to the gods, and then eat and live.

This is an atom: 
If we ever get
to Ithaca we will make restitution, for we will build altars to the
Sun and place costly gifts upon his shrine.

This is an atom: 
'

"Thus spoke Eurylochos, and the others lent a willing ear.

This is an atom: 
Helios was deeply angered, and spoke thus before the assembled
gods: 'Father Zeus and all ye immortal gods, behold the comrades of
Odysseus!

This is an atom: 
They have slaughtered my heifers, which gladdened my heart
as I went up to heaven and down to earth.

This is an atom: 
"And here happened a wonder which amazed my comrades.

This is an atom: 
The boat was filled with a sulphurous smoke, and my comrades
were shaken off into the sea and drowned.

This is an atom: 
As the monster was swallowing the salt brine, I caught
hold of the fig-tree and clung to it like a bat till she should throw
up my poor raft.

This is an atom: 
I floated about on the waters for nine long
days, and on the tenth I came to Calypso's island.

This is an atom: 
The enjoyment ran high, and the old poet, Demodokos, sang sweet songs.

This is an atom: 
May the gods bless thy gifts.

This is an atom: 
May I find my home, my wife
and child, and friends.

This is an atom: 
"

So spoke Odysseus, and left the hall.

This is an atom: 
The nymphs
spun their fine thread from stone spindles there, and wove their
sea-purple robes.

This is an atom: 
Zeus listened
to his complaint and gave him authority to destroy the Phæacian boat
and its crew.

This is an atom: 
The ship had gone, and it was broad daylight when Odysseus awoke.

This is an atom: 
His first thought was that the Phæacians had deceived him
and left him on an unknown shore.

This is an atom: 
He looked around and found that
his gifts had been carefully placed, so he knew that he had not been
robbed.

This is an atom: 
He counted his gifts and examined them.

This is an atom: 
There were tripods and vases of gold and brass and beautiful
hand-woven garments.

This is an atom: 
When Odysseus saw her, he hastened to her and said: "Hail, fair youth!

This is an atom: 
I am a stranger and find myself for the first time in this place.

This is an atom: 
It is rich in grain and grapes.

This is an atom: 
Nowhere can be found handsomer goats or finer cattle.

This is an atom: 
Every kind of
tree grows in its forests, and its springs are never dry.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus was overjoyed to find that he was in his own country.

This is an atom: 
I pray thee, goddess, do not jest with me.

This is an atom: 
Such ever is thy thought," answered the goddess.

This is an atom: 
I might have been slain in my own home but for these timely
words.

This is an atom: 
Now I am forearmed.

This is an atom: 
"

"Take courage," said the goddess.

This is an atom: 
Meantime I will take my way to Sparta.

This is an atom: 
The males were kept
outside and were fewer in number, for Eumaios was compelled to send
a very fat one to the suitors every day, and therefore there were
only eighteen score.

This is an atom: 
They were more like
wolves than dogs.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus followed the swineherd into the cabin.

This is an atom: 
Strangers and beggars are children of Zeus.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus loved me much.

This is an atom: 
Would that the gods might send
him back to us.

This is an atom: 
He would have paid me for my toil.

This is an atom: 
But he is dead.

This is an atom: 
May the whole
race of Helen be destroyed, for it was she who brought noble men to
destruction.

This is an atom: 
And he brought delicate wine in a
wooden cup, as well.

This is an atom: 
The suitors, who fear neither god nor man, eat the fat hogs.

This is an atom: 
"How shall we know but thou dost make up just such a story in order
to receive a tunic and a mantle?

This is an atom: 
It is a fact that my master does
not return.

This is an atom: 
I shall never
cease to grieve for him.

This is an atom: 
I hate the wretch who tells lies to
enrich himself as I hate death.

This is an atom: 
He will never come again.

This is an atom: 
Drink in
peace and let us talk of other things.

This is an atom: 
Who
are thy parents?

This is an atom: 
Tell me of thy toils and sufferings.

This is an atom: 
So he told the swineherd a long
string of stories.

This is an atom: 
Zeus smiled and granted the request.

This is an atom: 
She found the haughty suitors assembled there eating and
drinking.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos saw the goddess before anyone else.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos led the stranger away from this noisy hall, that he might
not be annoyed by their boisterous behavior.

This is an atom: 
A table was placed
before him, laden with the choicest viands, while a herald filled
a goblet with wine for him.

This is an atom: 
I am
an old friend of Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
Laertes will tell thee who I am.

This is an atom: 
Who knows where he is?

This is an atom: 
I am sure
that he is not dead.

This is an atom: 
Are they invited guests?

This is an atom: 
Is it a banquet I
see, or is there to be a wedding?

This is an atom: 
Every friend of Odysseus must feel sad to see them in this
place.

This is an atom: 
They will not
go away, but make themselves at home here and eat up my inheritance.

This is an atom: 
Vengeance, however, rests with the gods.

This is an atom: 
As an old friend of thy father, let me advise thee.

This is an atom: 
To-morrow
call thy people together in council and tell the suitors to depart.

This is an atom: 
"Then launch thy finest ship.

This is an atom: 
Sail to Pylos first and consult
with Nestor, and go to Sparta next and see Menelaos, who has returned
from Troy recently.

This is an atom: 
Then let thy mother marry again.

This is an atom: 
"

"Thou hast spoken to me as a father speaks to a son," answered
Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
"I shall bear thy words in mind.

This is an atom: 
And now I pray thee stay
awhile to rest and bathe.

This is an atom: 
"I must depart
at once.

This is an atom: 
Keep thy gift until I return, and then I will take it to
my home.

This is an atom: 
" She vanished as she spoke, and all that Telemachos saw was
a fleet-winged bird flying upward high in the air.

"Foolish old Mentor," said one of the suitors, "what art thou saying!

This is an atom: 
If Odysseus, himself, should come hither, he would not be able to
drive us out.

This is an atom: 
If anyone thinks himself strong enough to do it, let
him try it.

On the
way Athena cheered Telemachos and advised him what to say to the people.

This is an atom: 
"

"We are Greeks," said Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
We have never heard anything
of him during all these long years and do not know whether he is living
or dead.

This is an atom: 
Art thou then his son?

This is an atom: 
I look on thee
in wonder.

This is an atom: 
Yes, thou art like him.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus may come again.

This is an atom: 
A
handmaid brought a golden pitcher and a silver bowl for their hands,
and a table was placed before them laden with choice food.

This is an atom: 
These things are beyond price in richness.

This is an atom: 
I would gladly give all my wealth, if
I only knew him to be safe.

This is an atom: 
How much his old father must have grieved for him.

This is an atom: 
I see him
with astonishment.

This is an atom: 
Is it not true that this
is Telemachos?

This is an atom: 
At once, we rushed upon him
and caught him.

This is an atom: 
We held on until he was tired of trying to escape.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
Do not go that way.

This is an atom: 
Sail
only when it is dark.

This is an atom: 
A god will watch over thee.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos turned to Peisistratos and
said: "Let us arise and set forth on our journey with all haste, oh
son of Nestor.

This is an atom: 
Let me
bring thee costly gifts, and when thou hast had thy morning meal I
will hasten thee on thy way.

This is an atom: 
Peisistratos gazed with wonder at their beauty as he placed them in
the car.

This is an atom: 
Then they mounted the car
which had been brought to the palace gates.

This is an atom: 
All day the horses bounded on shaking their splendid harness.

This is an atom: 
A prospering
breeze swept over the sea and bore them rapidly along.

This is an atom: 
" The words had
hardly passed his lips when Telemachos entered the hut.

This is an atom: 
Eumaios
started to his feet and hastened to welcome his young master.

This is an atom: 
"She
has a loyal heart, but she wastes her life in weeping.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus sat down again.

This is an atom: 
I leave him to thee, however; do with him as thou dost like.

This is an atom: 
" "Thy
words do not please me, Eumaios," said Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
"

To him the sagacious Odysseus replied: "My friend, I hear with grief
the story of thy wrongs.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos was opposite to her, but he did not see
her, for the gods are not visible to all.

This is an atom: 
Only Odysseus and the dogs
were conscious of her presence.

This is an atom: 
Tell him all the truth.

This is an atom: 
I shall never be far from thee
myself and will help thee.

This is an atom: 
I long to see them attacked.

This is an atom: 
"

When she had finished speaking she touched Odysseus with her golden
wand.

This is an atom: 
His rags became seemly
garments.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus replied: "Nay, I am not a god, nor like the gods.

This is an atom: 
"
Saying this he kissed his son and wept.

This is an atom: 
"I pray thee do not deceive me," said Telemachos.

This is an atom: 
"Thou surely art
a deity and not my father.

This is an atom: 
No other Odysseus will ever come into
this cabin.

This is an atom: 
I am thy father.

This is an atom: 
The gods have all power to put men in high places
or to humble them.

This is an atom: 
At last Telemachos inquired: "Dear father, in what ship hast thou
come, and what sailors brought thee hither?

This is an atom: 
Thou couldst not have
come on foot.

This is an atom: 
Fifty-two of the wooers
come from one town with six servants.

This is an atom: 
"

Again Odysseus made reply: "Dear son, take courage.

This is an atom: 
Early to-morrow thou must
go to the city and mingle with the suitors.

This is an atom: 
Keep down thy wrath if
the wooers speak insultingly to me.

This is an atom: 
The day of their death is at hand.

This is an atom: 
"

All day the illustrious father and his son conversed and laid their
plans.

This is an atom: 
At evening the swineherd returned.

This is an atom: 
On entering his cabin he told
his young master that the suitors had learned of his safe return to
Ithaca.

This is an atom: 
I am forced to tell the
truth about it.

This is an atom: 
"

"My friend," said Odysseus, "I do not care to stay any longer.

This is an atom: 
I am too old to be of service here.

This is an atom: 
But
let me first warm me at the fire, for I am cold and the way is long.

This is an atom: 
Next came
Penelope, as beautiful as Artemis, and threw her arms about her son,
and kissed him on his brow and eyes.

This is an atom: 
I never hoped to see thee again.

This is an atom: 
Tell me about
thy father.

This is an atom: 
Hast thou any news of him?

This is an atom: 
What has happened?

This is an atom: 
" So did the queen greet her son.

This is an atom: 
"I
have barely escaped a cruel death.

This is an atom: 
When Telemachos came into the public square the suitors thronged
around him with smooth speeches, but in their hearts they kept on
plotting his death.

This is an atom: 
In the meantime Odysseus and Eumaios had started
for the city.

This is an atom: 
There is one knave leading
another.

This is an atom: 
Verily, the gods bring like and like together.

This is an atom: 
But work
does not suit such a fellow.

This is an atom: 
He would rather ramble idly about and
beg for food to fill his empty stomach.

This is an atom: 
" With that Melanthios kicked him in the thigh.

This is an atom: 
The latter seemed the better course.

This is an atom: 
He will give thee thy deserts, thou villain!

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLI
ODYSSEUS IS RECOGNIZED BY HIS DOG


After awhile Odysseus and Eumaios came to the house.

This is an atom: 
And there are walls and towers and countless rooms.

This is an atom: 
There must be a banquet within.

This is an atom: 
Now, let us consider what we are to do.

This is an atom: 
He had scented
the stag, the hare, and the wild goat for them many a time.

This is an atom: 
He is well built, and
surely is of a fine stock.

This is an atom: 
Is he fleet in the chase or a mere house-dog
kept for show?

This is an atom: 
He performed wonders in the
chase.

This is an atom: 
But his master has died
far from home, and the careless servants will not even throw him a
bone.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus took the food, and after thanking Telemachos, prayed to the
gods to give him everything good.

This is an atom: 
Each
one gave him something, and asked him who he was and whence he came.

This is an atom: 
Are there not beggars enough to eat up the wealth of thy master
without him?

This is an atom: 
Beggars come as they like.

This is an atom: 
No one expects to invite them.

This is an atom: 
Only people
of rank are invited to a feast.

This is an atom: 
He takes delight
in ugly words.

This is an atom: 
Antinoös spurned him saying: "What
demon hath brought this chattering beggar to spoil our pleasure?

This is an atom: 
Get
thee gone, or thou wilt soon be much the worse for coming.

This is an atom: 
Thou art
a bold and impudent old beggar.

This is an atom: 
Antinoös spoke again with insulting words, and one of the guests
rebuked him.

This is an atom: 
He was so angry, however, that he did not heed it.

This is an atom: 
I should like to speak with him.

This is an atom: 
It may be that he
has seen Odysseus, for he seems to have wandered far.

This is an atom: 
At sundown the swineherd left the palace to return to his
hut.

This is an atom: 
"

Telemachos at once obeyed.

This is an atom: 
They heaped
great logs on the fire.

This is an atom: 
Begone, or I will take a
firebrand and drive thee out!

This is an atom: 
" Odysseus rejoined: "Such is the fate
of beggars.

This is an atom: 
They must wander far and take abuse.

This is an atom: 
Once I was rich and had my own palace.

This is an atom: 
I often gave to beggars and I had many servants.

This is an atom: 
She turned to the saucy maid and said:
"Shame on thee, thou bold creature.

This is an atom: 
" she asked.

This is an atom: 
"Where is thy home?

This is an atom: 
Whence hast thou come?

This is an atom: 
I am a man of sorrows and have wandered far.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus responded truthfully: "He wore a cloak of purple wool, with
two clasps of gold, hand-wrought.

This is an atom: 
The pattern showed a hound
struggling with a spotted fawn, intent to kill it.

This is an atom: 
Alas!

This is an atom: 
I shall never
see him again.

This is an atom: 
It was a cruel fate that took him from me.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus was deeply moved, and tried to speak consoling words.

This is an atom: 
"Weep
not," he said, "for grief will wear away thy beauty and thy health.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus lives and will return.

This is an atom: 
Here I take the great oath that Odysseus will come
within a month.

This is an atom: 
Wilt thou permit me to lie down on the floor near the
fire, as I am used to do?

This is an atom: 
I care not for the bath, either, unless
there is some old servant who knows how to give a foot-bath to aged
feet.

This is an atom: 
My heart is sore for him.

This is an atom: 
Perhaps he is an object of ridicule among serving-women who will not
suffer him to come near the bath.

This is an atom: 
Surely
I never saw anyone who bore so close a resemblance to my lord as thou.

This is an atom: 
I knew thee the moment
that I touched the scar.

This is an atom: 
"

The loyal handmaid arose to bring another basin of water.

This is an atom: 
I teach my maids to spin and weave and care
for the palace.

This is an atom: 
Listen
to a dream I had the other night.

This is an atom: 
Perhaps thou canst explain it to
me.

This is an atom: 
Be patient a little longer,
for I have one thing more to say.

This is an atom: 
I shall propose
a contest for my hand.

This is an atom: 
Twenty years ago Odysseus set up twelve axes,
one behind the other, in the court.

This is an atom: 
"

Odysseus responded: "Do not let the contest be put off.

This is an atom: 
"I could sit
and listen to thee all night.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly Athena appeared
to him, and said: "Odysseus, why dost thou lie awake?

This is an atom: 
"But I am only one and the suitors are
many.

This is an atom: 
How shall I, single-handed, meet this multitude of men?

This is an atom: 
"To lie awake saps the
life and strength of men.

This is an atom: 
The gods protect thee and they are stronger than armed
warriors.

This is an atom: 
The very thought
vexes me day and night.

This is an atom: 
Just now I had a dream.

This is an atom: 
I seemed to see Odysseus
just as he was when he started out for Troy.

This is an atom: 
"

She prayed aloud, and soon daylight appeared.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus heard the voice
and it filled his heart with anxiety.

This is an atom: 
There was a busy time.

This is an atom: 
The menials obeyed, some bringing water, some
sweeping the floors, others polishing the benches and covering them
with royal tapestries.

This is an atom: 
Eumaios arrived early, driving three fat hogs.

This is an atom: 
" While they were talking together the goatherd
joined him, and repeated the sneers and abuse of the preceding day.

This is an atom: 
A long and happy life be thine!

This is an atom: 
Odysseus dodged it by holding down his head.

This is an atom: 
Their speech became rambling and they laughed insanely.

This is an atom: 
They ate and
drank like men deranged.

This is an atom: 
MART.

This is an atom: 
LIB.

This is an atom: 
5, EP.

This is an atom: 
59.

This is an atom: 
Beyond the Indies does this morrow live?

This is an atom: 
MART.

This is an atom: 
LIB.

This is an atom: 
2, EP.

This is an atom: 
90.

This is an atom: 
Which if a chaste wife crown, no less in her Than fortune, I the
golden mean prefer.

This is an atom: 
Too noble, nor too wise, she should not be, No, nor too rich, too
fair, too fond of me.

This is an atom: 
Thus let my life slide silently away, With sleep all night, and
quiet all the day.

This is an atom: 
OF MYSELF.

This is an atom: 
" He raised his ragged tunic for a moment and they looked
at the scar.

This is an atom: 
Eurymachos and Antinoös were the last to make trial of the bow.

This is an atom: 
Eurymachos sat before the fire and warmed it on both sides, but he
could not bend it.

This is an atom: 
He should have no rival.

This is an atom: 
Let the bow alone, lest the god be angry and leave the axes standing
in a row.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XLVIII
ODYSSEUS BENDS THE BOW


The suitors approved the words of Antinoös.

This is an atom: 
"

The suitors were moved with desperate fear and anger.

This is an atom: 
Thou art drunk and thy mind
wanders.

This is an atom: 
What would come to thee if thou shouldst bend this bow?

This is an atom: 
Do not let your minds be teased with
such thoughts.

This is an atom: 
' It would be a never-ending shame
to us.

This is an atom: 
Let him try the bow.

This is an atom: 
In the meanwhile the swineherd took up the bow and undertook to carry
it to Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
The suitors shouted their disapproval, and he became
confused and set it down.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos called out above the clamor and
gave command for him to carry it along.

This is an atom: 
" Odysseus stretched the cord
and made it fast from end to end.

This is an atom: 
It sang like a bird.

This is an atom: 
With
perfect ease he drew the cord and let the arrow fly.

This is an atom: 
The suitors turned pale.

This is an atom: 
Zeus sent a loud thunder-clap and Odysseus
rejoiced at the omen.

This is an atom: 
Now I will choose another target.

This is an atom: 
An arrow pierced his throat.

This is an atom: 
The bread and meat were scattered in every direction over the
floor.

This is an atom: 
The suitors sprang to their feet and looked for the weapons
on the walls.

This is an atom: 
They poured out threats.

This is an atom: 
How couldst thou be so careless!

This is an atom: 
Dogs and vultures shall devour thee.

This is an atom: 
But now the hour of your death has come and your doom is
certain.

This is an atom: 
"

The suitors trembled and looked for some open door through which to
fly for safety.

This is an atom: 
Only Eurymachos took courage to make a defence.

This is an atom: 
He had no thought of love for thy wife.

This is an atom: 
Be
sure no suitor shall escape my vengeance.

This is an atom: 
"

The suitors all grew faint with fear.

This is an atom: 
Eurymachos cried out to them:
"Ye Ithacans, this man will stand there at the door and shoot us all
down one by one.

This is an atom: 
Out with your swords!

This is an atom: 
"

With a fearful shout Eurymachos then drew his own sword and sprang
toward Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
Death closed his eyes.

This is an atom: 
Another suitor drew his sword and rushed toward Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos
met him with a lance and slew him.

This is an atom: 
They hastened to the armory and found Melanthios, who had come back
for a second load.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLIX
DEATH OF THE SUITORS


The combat grew more stubborn.

This is an atom: 
Athena, in the guise of Mentor, stood
near Odysseus and cheered him on.

This is an atom: 
"We will not
spare thee when we have slain him.

This is an atom: 
More yet, we will drive thy wife
and children out of Ithaca and keep thy wealth.

This is an atom: 
" The goddess, in great
anger at this audacity, turned toward Odysseus and said: "Thou art
not so swift and terrible in fighting, O Chieftain, as thou wert before
the walls of Troy.

This is an atom: 
"

Athena said this to spur Odysseus on, but she did not remain at his
side.

This is an atom: 
She changed herself into a swallow and perched upon a rafter
of the great hall, to put his prowess to a greater test.

This is an atom: 
When she
had gone, the suitors grew braver and threw their spears at Odysseus
thick and fast.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus and Telemachos and their faithful servants hurled their
lances, and the weapons always hit the mark.

This is an atom: 
"

Four of the wooers fell to the ground at once and the remainder
retreated to the farthest corner of the hall.

This is an atom: 
Still they rallied for
another onset.

This is an atom: 
Only the minstrel Phemios and
the herald Medon were spared.

This is an atom: 
Not
one survived.

This is an atom: 
The loyal servants crowded about their
chieftain and welcomed him with glad salutations.

This is an atom: 
They kissed his
hands and face, and wept and laughed for joy.

This is an atom: 
Odysseus was deeply
moved and sobbed aloud.

This is an atom: 
"Penelope," she cried,
"my child, Odysseus has come.

This is an atom: 
Thy husband is here, and he has slain
the whole crew of insolent suitors who squandered his riches and
scoffed at his son.

This is an atom: 
The gods have taken thy wits away.

This is an atom: 
Do not mock me with such
idle tales.

This is an atom: 
The beggar whom they scoffed at in the hall
was Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos knew it, but dared not tell thee until the
suitors should be slain.

This is an atom: 
"

Penelope rose from her couch and seized Eurycleia by the hands.

This is an atom: 
The doors were locked to bar us from
the hall.

This is an atom: 
"

"My daughter," said the aged nurse, "what words are these?

This is an atom: 
' Now follow me.

This is an atom: 
"

Penelope descended from her royal bower uncertain how to meet her
lord.

This is an atom: 
Penelope was speechless.

This is an atom: 
Telemachos became impatient and spoke to her, chiding her.

This is an atom: 
"Mother,"
he said, "thou art hard-hearted and unkind.

This is an atom: 
Take thy place at my
father's side and question him.

This is an atom: 
Verily thy heart is harder than a
stone.

This is an atom: 
It is more important now to
prevent the news that the suitors have been slain from spreading.

This is an atom: 
They have friends all over the city.

This is an atom: 
After awhile those outside were heard to say: "Shame on Penelope!

This is an atom: 
She might have waited for him to return.

This is an atom: 
I remember
well when thou didst go to Troy.

This is an atom: 
I built that
massive frame myself.

This is an atom: 
It was a tall olive-tree that grew within one
of the courts.

This is an atom: 
Thou hast made me believe in thee.

This is an atom: 
Let me see whether he will know me, after I have been so
long away.

This is an atom: 
" Placing his weapons in their hands, he went down into
the orchard.

This is an atom: 
Every fig and vine and pear and olive has
been carefully trained.

This is an atom: 
But no one seems to care for thee.

This is an atom: 
Thy master
treats thee badly, for thou art ill-clad and unkempt.

This is an atom: 
An old man
deserves better things.

This is an atom: 
Indeed one might take thee for a king.

This is an atom: 
Now tell me, who owns
this orchard?

This is an atom: 
And tell me also if this land is Ithaca.

This is an atom: 
"

Laertes wept.

This is an atom: 
"Thou art indeed in Ithaca, O stranger," he said.

This is an atom: 
"But
thou dost seek in vain for Odysseus.

This is an atom: 
Woe is me!

This is an atom: 
Tell me, what is thy name?

This is an atom: 
Where is thy ship?

This is an atom: 
Here is the
scar given me by the wild boar as I hunted on Parnassos.

This is an atom: 
There were thirteen pear-trees, forty fig-trees, and
ten apple-trees.

This is an atom: 
"

Overwhelmed with joy, the old king trembled from head to foot.

This is an atom: 
Laertes went to the bath and came back
clad like a king.

This is an atom: 
Meantime the souls of the suitors had gone down to the abode of Pluto.

This is an atom: 
Then Agamemnon's ghost responded: "Fortunate Odysseus!

This is an atom: 
His fame shall last forever, and poets shall sing the praises of
Penelope in all the coming ages.

This is an atom: 
"

The Ithacans were now divided against themselves.

This is an atom: 
"
Telemachos responded: "There is no danger of that, my dear father,
as I shall show thee presently.

This is an atom: 
Retire at once from this contest and shed no more
blood.

This is an atom: 
"

The Ithacans grew pale with fright at hearing the voice of the goddess.

This is an atom:

fear.

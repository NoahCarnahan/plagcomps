This is an atom: 
By Jules Verne


CHAPTER I.

CHARLESTON, SEPTEMBER 27th, 1869.--It is high tide, and three o'clock
in the afternoon when we leave the Battery-quay; the ebb carries us off
shore, and as Captain Huntly has hoisted both main and top sails, the
northerly breeze drives the "Chancellor" briskly across the bay.

This is an atom: 
Fort
Sumter ere long is doubled, the sweeping batteries of the mainland on
our left are soon passed, and by four o'clock the rapid current of the
ebbing tide has carried us through the harbour-mouth.

This is an atom: 
But as yet we have not reached the open sea; we have still to thread our
way through the narrow channels which the surge has hollowed out amongst
the sand-banks.

This is an atom: 
The captain takes a south-west course, rounding the
lighthouse at the corner of the fort; the sails are closely trimmed; the
last sandy point is safely coasted, and at length, at seven o'clock in
the evening; we are out free upon the wide Atlantic.

This is an atom: 
The "Chancellor" is a fine square-rigged three-master, of 900 tons
burden, and belongs to the wealthy Liverpool firm of Laird Brothers.

This is an atom: 
She
is two years old, is sheathed and secured with copper, her decks being
of teak, and the base of all her masts, except the mizzen, with all their
fittings, being of iron.

This is an atom: 
She is registered first class A I, and is now
on her third voyage between Charleston and Liverpool.

This is an atom: 
As she wended her
way through the channels of Charleston harbour, it was the British flag
that was lowered from her mast-head; but without colours at all,
no sailor could have hesitated for a moment in telling her
nationality,--for English she was, and nothing but English from her
water-line upwards to the truck of her masts.

This is an atom: 
I must now relate how it happens that I have taken my passage on board
the "Chancellor" on her return voyage to England.

This is an atom: 
At present there is no
direct steamship service between South Carolina and Great Britain,
and all who wish to cross must go either northwards to New York or
southwards to New Orleans.

This is an atom: 
It is quite true that if I had chosen to
start from New York I might have found plenty of vessels belonging to
English, French, or Hamburg lines, any of which would have conveyed me
by a rapid voyage to my destination; and it is equally true that if I
had selected New Orleans for my embarkation I could readily have reached
Europe by one of the vessels of the National Steam Navigation Company,
which join the French Transatlantic line of Colon and Aspinwall.

This is an atom: 
But it
was fated to be otherwise.

This is an atom: 
One day, as I was loitering about the Charleston quays, my eye lighted
upon this vessel.

This is an atom: 
There was something about the "Chancellor" that
pleased me, and a kind of involuntary impulse took me on board, where I
found the internal arrangements perfectly comfortable.

This is an atom: 
Yielding to the
idea that a voyage in a sailing vessel had certain charms beyond the
transit in a steamer, and reckoning that with wind and wave in my
favour there would be little material difference in time; considering,
moreover, that in these low latitudes the weather in early autumn is
fine and unbroken, I came to my decision, and proceeded forthwith to
secure my passage by this route to Europe.

This is an atom: 
Whether I shall have reason to regret my
determination is a problem to be solved in the future.

This is an atom: 
However, I will
begin to record the incidents of our daily experience, dubious as I feel
whether the lines of my chronicle will ever find a reader.

This is an atom: 
SEPTEMBER 28th.--John Silas Huntly, the captain of the "Chancellor," has
the reputation of being an experienced navigator of the Atlantic.

This is an atom: 
He is
a Scotchman, a native of Dundee, and is about fifty years of age.

This is an atom: 
He is
of middle height and slight build, and has a small head, which he has a
habit of holding a little over his left shoulder.

This is an atom: 
I do not pretend to be
much of a physiognomist, but I am inclined to believe that my few hours'
acquaintance with our captain has given me considerable insight into
his character.

This is an atom: 
That he is a good seaman and thoroughly understands his
duties I could not for a moment venture to deny; but that he is a man
of resolute temperament, or that he possesses the amount of courage
that would render him, physically or morally, capable of coping with
any great emergency, I confess I cannot believe.

This is an atom: 
He does not appear
as though he could be energetic enough ever to be stubborn; he never
frowns, sets his teeth, or clenches his fist.

This is an atom: 
There is something
enigmatical about him; however, I shall study him closely and do what
I can to understand the man who, as commander of a vessel, should be to
those around him "second only to God.

This is an atom: 
"

Unless I am greatly mistaken there is another man on board who,
if circumstances should require it, would take the more prominent
position--I mean the mate.

This is an atom: 
I have hitherto, however, had such little
opportunity of observing his character, that I must defer saying more
about him at present.

This is an atom: 
Besides the captain and this mate, whose name is Robert Curtis, our crew
consists of Walter, the lieutenant, the boatswain, and fourteen sailors,
all English or Scotch, making eighteen altogether, a number quite
sufficient for working a vessel of 900 tons burden.

This is an atom: 
Up to this time my
sole experience of their capabilities is, that under the command of the
mate, they brought us skillfully enough through the narrow channels of
Charleston; and I have no reason to doubt but that they are well up to
their work.

This is an atom: 
My list of the ship's officials is incomplete unless I mention Hobart,
the steward, and Jynxstrop, the negro cook.

This is an atom: 
In addition to these, the "Chancellor" carries eight passengers,
including myself.

This is an atom: 
Hitherto, the bustle of embarkation, the arrangement
of cabins, and all the variety of preparations inseparable from starting
on a voyage for at least twenty or five-and-twenty days have precluded
the formation of any acquaintanceships; but the monotony of the voyage,
the close proximity into which we must be thrown, and the natural
curiosity to know something of each other's affairs, will doubtless lead
us in due time to an interchange of ideas.

This is an atom: 
Two days have elapsed and
I have not even seen all the passengers.

This is an atom: 
Probably sea-sickness has
prevented some of them from making their appearance at the common
table.

This is an atom: 
One thing, however, I do know; namely, that there are two ladies
occupying the stern-cabins, the windows of which are in the aft-board of
the vessel.

This is an atom: 
I have seen the ship's list and subjoin a list of the passengers.

This is an atom: 
They
are as follow:--Mr.

This is an atom: 
SEPTEMBER 29th.--Captain Huntly's bill of lading, that is to say, the
document that describes the "Chancellor's" cargo and the conditions of
transport, is couched in the following terms:--

"BRONSFIELD AND CO., AGENTS, CHARLESTON.

This is an atom: 
"I, John Silas Huntly, of Dundee, Scotland, commander of the ship
'Chancellor,' of about 900 tons burden, now at Charleston, do purpose,
by the blessing of God, at the earliest convenient season, and by the
direct route, to sail for the port of Liverpool, where I shall obtain
my discharge.

This is an atom: 
I do hereby acknowledge that I have received from you,
Messrs.

This is an atom: 
Bronsfield and Co., Commission Agents, Charleston, and have
placed the same under the gun-deck of the aforesaid ship, seventeen
hundred bales of cotton, of the estimated value of 26,000l., all in
good condition, marked and numbered as in the margin; which goods I do
undertake to transport to Liverpool, and there to deliver, free from
injury (save only such injury as shall have been caused by the chances
of the sea), to Messrs.

This is an atom: 
Laird Brothers, or to their order, or to their
representative, who shall on due delivery of the said freight pay me the
sum of 2000l.

This is an atom: 
inclusive, according to the charter-party and damages in
addition, according to the usages and customs of the sea.

This is an atom: 
"And for the fulfillment of the above covenant, I have pledged and do
pledge my person, my property, and my interest in the vessel aforesaid,
with all its appurtenances.

This is an atom: 
In witness whereof, I have signed three
agreements, all of the same purport; on the condition that when the
terms of one are accomplished, the other two shall be absolutely null
and void.

This is an atom: 
"


From the foregoing document it will be understood that the "Chancellor"
is conveying 1700 bales of cotton to Liverpool; that the shippers are
Bronsfield, of Charleston, and the consignees are Laird Brothers, of
Liverpool.

This is an atom: 
The ship was constructed with the especial design of carrying
cotton, and the entire hold, with the exception of a very limited space
reserved for passengers' luggage, is closely packed with the bales, The
lading was performed with the utmost care, each bale being pressed into
its proper place by the aid of screw-jacks, so that the whole freight
forms one solid and compact mass; not an inch of space is wasted, and
the vessel is thus made capable of carrying her full complement of
cargo.

This is an atom: 
SEPTEMBER 30th to OCTOBER 6th.--The "Chancellor" is a rapid sailer, and
more than a match for many a vessel of the same dimensions.

This is an atom: 
She scuds
along merrily in the freshening breeze, leaving in her wake, far as the
eye can reach, a long white line of foam as well defined as a delicate
strip of lace stretched upon an azure ground.

This is an atom: 
The Atlantic is not visited by many gales, and I have every reason to
believe that the rolling and pitching of the vessel no longer incommode
any of the passengers, who are all more or less accustomed to the sea.

This is an atom: 
A vacant seat at our table is now very rare; we are beginning to know
something about each other, and our daily life, in consequence, is
becoming somewhat less monotonous.

This is an atom: 
To say the truth, he looks older than he really is: his
drooping head, his dejected manner, and his eye, ever and again suffused
with tears, indicate that he is haunted by some deep and abiding sorrow.

This is an atom: 
He never laughs; he rarely even smiles, and then only on his son:
his countenance ordinarily bearing a look of bitterness tempered by
affection, while his general expression is one of caressing tenderness.

This is an atom: 
It excites an involuntary commiseration to learn that M. Letourneur is
consuming himself by exaggerated reproaches on account of the infirmity
of an afflicted son.

This is an atom: 
Andre Letourneur is about twenty years of age, with a gentle,
interesting countenance, but, to the irrepressible grief of his father,
is a hopeless cripple.

This is an atom: 
His left leg is miserably deformed, and he is
quite unable to walk without the assistance of a stick.

This is an atom: 
It is obvious
that the father's life is bound up with that of his son; his devotion
is unceasing; every thought, every glance is for Andre; he seems to
anticipate his most trifling wish, watches his slightest movement, and
his arm is ever ready to support or otherwise assist the child whose
sufferings he more than shares.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur seems to have taken a peculiar fancy to myself,
and constantly talks about Andre.

This is an atom: 
This morning, in the course of
conversation, I said,--

"You have a good son, M. Letourneur.

This is an atom: 
I have just been talking to him.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," replied M. Letourneur, brightening up into a smile,
"his afflicted frame contains a noble mind.

This is an atom: 
He is like his mother, who
died at his birth.

This is an atom: 
"

"He is full of reverence and love for you, sir," I remarked.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon,"
he continued, "you do not know what it is to a father to have a son a
cripple, beyond hope of cure.

This is an atom: 
"

"M. Letourneur," I answered, "you take more than your share of the
affliction which has fallen upon you and your son.

This is an atom: 
That M. Andre is
entitled to the very greatest commiseration no one can deny; but you
should remember, that after all a physical infirmity is not so hard to
bear as mental grief.

This is an atom: 
Now, I have watched your son pretty closely, and
unless I am much mistaken there is nothing, that troubles him so much as
the sight of your own sorrow.

This is an atom: 
"

"But I never let him see it," he broke in hastily.

This is an atom: 
"My sole thought
is how to divert him.

This is an atom: 
I have discovered, that in spite of his physical
weakness, he delights in travelling; so for the last few years we have
been constantly on the move.

This is an atom: 
We first went all over Europe, and are now
returning from visiting the principal places in the United States.

This is an atom: 
I never allowed my son to go to college, but instructed him entirely
myself, and these travels, I hope, will serve to complete his education.

This is an atom: 
He is very intelligent, and has a lively imagination, and I am sometimes
tempted to hope that in contemplating the wonders of nature he forgets
his own infirmity.

This is an atom: 
"But," continued M. Letourneur, taking my hand, "although, perhaps, HE
may forget, I can never forget.

This is an atom: 
Ah, sir, do you suppose that Andre can
ever forgive his parents for bringing him into the world a cripple?

This is an atom: 
"

The remorse of the unhappy father was very distressing, and I was
about to say a few kind words of sympathy when Andre himself made his
appearance.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur hastened toward him and assisted him up the
few steep steps that led to the poop.

This is an atom: 
As soon as Andre was comfortably seated on one of the benches, and his
father had taken his place by his side, I joined them, and we fell into
conversation upon ordinary topics, discussing the various points of
the "Chancellor," the probable length of the passage, and the different
details of our life on board.

This is an atom: 
I find that M. Letourneur's estimate of
Captain Huntly's character very much coincided with my own, and that,
like me, he is impressed with the man's undecided manner and sluggish
appearance.

This is an atom: 
Like me, too, he has formed a very favourable opinion of
Robert Curtis, the mate, a man of about thirty years of age, of great
muscular power, with a frame and a will that seem ever ready for action.

This is an atom: 
Whilst we were still talking of him, Curtis himself came on deck, and as
I watched his movements I could not help being struck with his physical
development; his erect and easy carriage, his fearless glance and
slightly contracted brow all betokened a man of energy, thoroughly
endowed with the calmness and courage that are indispensable to the
true sailor.

This is an atom: 
He seems a kind-hearted fellow, too, and is always ready
to assist and amuse young Letourneur, who evidently enjoys his company.

This is an atom: 
After he had scanned the weather and examined the trim of the sails, he
joined our party and proceeded to give us some information about those
of our fellow-passengers with whom at present we have made but slight
acquaintance.

This is an atom: 
Kear, the American, who is accompanied by his wife, has made a large
fortune in the petroleum springs in the United States.

This is an atom: 
He is a man of
about fifty, a most uninteresting companion, being overwhelmed with
a sense of his own wealth and importance, and consequently supremely
indifferent to all around him.

This is an atom: 
His hands are always in his pockets,
and the chink of money seems to follow him wherever he goes.

This is an atom: 
Vain and
conceited, a fool as well as an egotist, he struts about like a peacock
showing its plumage, and to borrow the words of the physiognomist
Gratiolet, "il se flaire, il se savoure, il se goute.

This is an atom: 
" Why he should
have taken his passage on board a mere merchant vessel instead of
enjoying the luxuries of a Transatlantic steamer, I am altogether at a
loss to explain.

This is an atom: 
She never reads, never talks, and I believe I am not wrong in
saying, never thinks.

This is an atom: 
She seems to look without seeing, and listen
without hearing, and her sole occupation consists in giving her orders
to her companion, Miss Herbey, a young English girl of about twenty.

This is an atom: 
Her complexion is fair and her eyes
deep blue, whilst her pleasing countenance is altogether free from
that insignificance of feature which is not unfrequently alleged to be
characteristic of English beauty.

This is an atom: 
Her mouth would be charming if she
ever smiled, but exposed as she is to the ridiculous whims and fancies
of a capricious mistress, her lips rarely relax from their ordinary
grave expression.

This is an atom: 
Yet humiliating as her position must be, she never
utters a word of open complaint, but quietly and gracefully performs her
duties accepting without a murmur the paltry salary which the bumptious
petroleum-merchant condescends to allow her.

This is an atom: 
He has the management of some extensive hydraulic works in
South Carolina, and is now on his way to Europe to obtain some improved
apparatus, and more especially to visit the mines worked by centrifugal
force, belonging to the firm of Messrs.

This is an atom: 
He is forty-five years of
age, with all his interests so entirely absorbed by his machinery that
he seems to have neither a thought nor a care beyond his mechanical
calculations.

This is an atom: 
Once let him engage you in conversation, and there is no
chance of escape; you have no help for it but to listen as patiently as
you can until he has completed the explanation of his designs.

This is an atom: 
Without any originality or magnanimity in his composition, he
has spent twenty years of his life in mere buying and selling, and as
he has generally contrived to do business at a profit, he has realized a
considerable fortune.

This is an atom: 
What he is going to do with the money, he does
not seem able to say: his ideas do not go beyond retail trade, his mind
having been so long closed to all other impressions that it appears
incapable of thought or reflection on any subject besides.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER V.

OCTOBER 7th.--This is the tenth day since we left Charleston, and I
should think our progress has been very rapid.

This is an atom: 
Robert Curtis, the mate,
with whom I continue to have many a friendly chat, informed me that we
could not be far off Cape Hatteras in the Bermudas; the ship's bearings,
he said were lat.

This is an atom: 
W., so that
he had every reason to believe that we should sight St.

This is an atom: 
"But how is it we are off the Bermudas?

This is an atom: 
I
should have thought that a vessel sailing from Charleston to Liverpool,
would have kept northwards, and have followed the track of the Gulf
Stream.

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes, indeed; sir," replied Curtis, "that is the usual course; but you
see that this time the captain hasn't chosen to take it.

This is an atom: 
"

"But why not?

This is an atom: 
"That's not for me to say, sir; he ordered us eastwards, and eastwards
we go.

This is an atom: 
Curtis acknowledged that he had already pointed out what an unusual
route they were taking, but that the captain had said that he was quite
aware what he was about.

This is an atom: 
The mate made no further remark; but the knit
of his brow, as he passed his hand mechanically across his forehead,
made me fancy that he was inclined to speak out more strongly.

This is an atom: 
"All very well, Curtis," I said, "but I don't know what to think about
trying new routes.

This is an atom: 
Here we are at the 7th of October, and if we are to
reach Europe before the bad weather sets in, I should suppose there is
not a day to be lost.

This is an atom: 
"

"Right, sir, quite right; there is not a day to be lost.

This is an atom: 
"

Struck by his manner, I ventured to add, "Do you mind, Mr.

This is an atom: 
"

He hesitated a moment, and then replied shortly, "He is my captain,
sir.

This is an atom: 
"

This evasive answer of course put an end to any further interrogation on
my part, but it only set me thinking the more.

This is an atom: 
At about three o'clock the lookout man sung out
that there was land to windward, and descried what seemed as if it might
be a line of smoke in the north-east horizon.

This is an atom: 
At six, I went on deck
with M. Letourneur and his son, and we could then distinctly make out
the low group of the Bermudas, encircled by their formidable chain of
breakers.

This is an atom: 
"There," said Andre Letourneur to me, as we stood gazing at the distant
land, "there lies the enchanted Archipelago, sung by your poet Moore.

This is an atom: 
The exile Waller, too, as long ago as 1643, wrote an enthusiastic
panegyric on the islands, and I have been told that at one time English
ladies would wear no other bonnets than such as were made of the leaves
of the Bermuda palm.

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes," I replied, "the Bermudas were all the rage in the seventeenth
century, although latterly they have fallen into comparative oblivion.

This is an atom: 
"

"But let me tell you, M. Andre," interposed Curtis, who had as usual
joined our party, "that although poets may rave, and be as enthusiastic
as they like about these islands, sailors will tell a different tale.

This is an atom: 
The hidden reefs that lie in a semicircle about two or three leagues
from shore make the attempt to land a very dangerous piece of business.

This is an atom: 
Let the natives boast as they will about
their splendid climate, they, are visited by the most frightful
hurricanes.

This is an atom: 
They get the fag-end of the storms that rage over the
Antilles; and the fag-end of a storm is like the tail of a whale;
it's just the strongest bit of it.

This is an atom: 
I don't think you'll find a sailor
listening much to your poets,--your Moores, and your Wallers.

This is an atom: 
Curtis," said Andre, smiling, "but poets
are like proverbs; you can always find one to contradict another.

This is an atom: 
Although Waller and Moore have chosen to sing the praises of the
Bermudas, it has been supposed that Shakspeare was depicting them in the
terrible scenes that are found in 'The Tempest.

This is an atom: 
Situated between the Antilles and Nova Scotia, the
Bermudas have ever since their discovery belonged to the English,
who have mainly used them for a military station.

This is an atom: 
But this little
archipelago, comprising some hundred and fifty different isles and
islets, is destined to increase, and that, perhaps, on a larger scale
than has yet been anticipated.

This is an atom: 
Beneath the waves there are madrepores,
in infinity of number, silently but ceaselessly pursuing their labours;
and with time, that fundamental element in nature's workings, who shall
tell whether these may not gradually build up island after island, which
shall unite and form another continent?

This is an atom: 
I may mention that there was not another of our fellow-passengers who
took the trouble to come on deck and give a glance at this strange
cluster of islands.

This is an atom: 
Miss Herbey, it is true, was making an attempt to
join us, but she had barely reached the poop, when Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Kear's languid
voice was heard recalling her for some trifling service to her side.

This is an atom: 
OCTOBER 8th to OCTOBER 13th.--The wind is blowing hard from the
north-east; and the "Chancellor" under low-reefed top-sail and
fore-sail, and labouring against a heavy sea, has been obliged to be
brought ahull.

This is an atom: 
The joists and girders all creak again until one's teeth
are set on edge.

This is an atom: 
I am the only passenger not remaining below; but I
prefer being on deck notwithstanding the driving rain, fine as dust,
which penetrates to my very skin.

This is an atom: 
We have been driven along in this
fashion for the best part of two days; the "stiffish breeze" has
gradually freshened into "a gale;" the top-gallants have been lowered,
and, as I write, the wind is blowing with a velocity of fifty or sixty
miles an hour.

This is an atom: 
Although the "Chancellor" has many good points, her drift
is considerable, and we have been carried far to the south we can
only guess at our precise position, as the cloudy atmosphere entirely
precludes us from taking the sun's altitude.

This is an atom: 
All along throughout this period, my fellow-passengers are totally
ignorant of the extraordinary course that we are taking England lies
to the NORTH-EAST, yet we are sailing directly SOUTH-EAST, and Robert
Curtis owns that he is quite bewildered; he cannot comprehend why the
captain, ever since this north-easterly gale has been blowing, should
persist in allowing the ship to drive to the south, instead of tacking
to the north-west until she gets into better quarters.

This is an atom: 
I was alone with Curtis to-day upon the poop, and could not help saying
to him "Curtis, is your captain mad?

This is an atom: 
"

"Perhaps, sir, I might be allowed to ask what YOU think upon that
matter," was his cautious reply.

This is an atom: 
"Well to say the truth," I answered, "I can hardly tell; but I confess
there is every now and then a wandering in his eye, and an odd look on
his face that I do not like.

This is an atom: 
Again last night I spoke to him
about the route we were taking, but he only said he knew all about it,
and that it was all right.

This is an atom: 
"

"What do Lieutenant Walter and your boatswain think of it all?

This is an atom: 
"Think; why they think just the same as I do," replied the mate; "but
if the captain chooses to take the ship to China we should obey his
orders.

This is an atom: 
"

"But surely," I exclaimed, "there must be some limit to your obedience!

This is an atom: 
Suppose the man is actually mad, what then?

This is an atom: 
"

"If he should be mad enough, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon, to bring the vessel into any
real danger, I shall know what to do.

This is an atom: 
"

With this assurance I am forced to be content.

This is an atom: 
Matters, however, have
taken a different turn to what I bargained for when I took my passage
on board the "Chancellor.

This is an atom: 
" The weather has become worse and worse.

This is an atom: 
As I
have already said, the ship under her large low-reefed top-sail and fore
stay-sail has been brought ahull, that is to say, she copes directly
with the wind, by presenting her broad bows to the sea; and so we go on
still drift, drift, continually to the south.

This is an atom: 
How southerly our course has been is very apparent; for upon the night
of the 11th we fairly entered upon that portion of the Atlantic which
is known as the Sargassos Sea.

This is an atom: 
An extensive tract of water is this,
enclosed by the warm current of the Gulf Stream, and thickly covered
with the wrack, called by the Spaniards "sargasso," the abundance of
which so seriously impeded the progress of Columbus's vessels on his
first voyage across the ocean.

This is an atom: 
Each morning at daybreak the Atlantic has presented an aspect so
remarkable, that at my solicitation, M. Letourneur and his son have
ventured upon deck to witness the unusual spectacle.

This is an atom: 
The squally gusts
make the metal shrouds vibrate like harp-strings; and unless we were
on our guard to keep our clothes wrapped tightly to us, they would have
been torn off our backs in shreds.

This is an atom: 
The scene presented to our eyes is
one of strangest interest.

This is an atom: 
The sea, carpeted thickly with masses of
prolific fucus, is a vast unbroken plain of vegetation, through which
the vessel makes her way as a plough.

This is an atom: 
Long strips of seaweed caught up
by the wind become entangled in the rigging, and hang between the masts
in festoons of verdure; whilst others, varying from two to three hundred
feet in length, twine themselves up to the very mast-heads, from whence
they float like streaming pendants.

This is an atom: 
For many hours now, the "Chancellor"
has been contending with this formidable accumulation of algae; her
masts are circled with hydrophytes; her rigging is wreathed everywhere
with creepers, fantastic as the untrammelled tendrils of a vine, and as
she works her arduous course, there are times when I can only compare
her to an animated grove of verdure making its mysterious way over some
illimitable prairie.

This is an atom: 
OCTOBER 14th.--At last we are free from the sea of vegetation, the
boisterous gale has moderated into a steady breeze, the sun is shining
brightly, the weather is warm and genial, and thus, two reefs in her
top-sails, briskly and merrily sails the "Chancellor.

This is an atom: 
"

Under conditions so favourable, we have been able to take the ship's
bearings: our latitude, we find, is 21deg.

This is an atom: 
Here we
are, already more than ten degrees south of the point from which, we
started, and yet still we are persistently following a south-easterly
course!

This is an atom: 
I cannot bring myself to the conclusion that the man is mad.

This is an atom: 
I
have had various conversations with him: he has always spoken rationally
and sensibly.

This is an atom: 
Perhaps his case is one
of those in which insanity is partial, and where the mania is of
a character which extends only to the matters connected with his
profession.

This is an atom: 
I can get nothing out of Curtis; he listens coldly whenever I allude
to the subject, and only repeats what he has said before, that nothing
short of an overt act of madness on the part of the captain could induce
him to supersede the captain's authority and that the imminent peril of
the ship could alone justify him in taking so decided a measure.

This is an atom: 
Last evening I went to my cabin about eight o'clock, and after an hour's
reading by the light of my cabin-lamp, I retired to my berth and was
soon asleep.

This is an atom: 
Some hours later I was aroused by an unaccustomed noise on
deck.

This is an atom: 
There were heavy footsteps hurrying to and fro, and the voices
of the men were loud and eager, as if the crew were agitated by some
strange disturbance.

This is an atom: 
My first impression was, that some tacking had been
ordered which rendered it needful to fathom the yards; but the vessel
continuing to lie to starboard convinced me that this was not the origin
of the commotion, I was curious to know the truth, and made all haste
I could to go on deck; but before I was ready, the noise had ceased.

This is an atom: 
I heard Captain Huntly return to his cabin, and accordingly I retired
again to my own berth.

This is an atom: 
Whatever may have been the meaning of the
manoeuvre, I cannot tell; it did not seem to have resulted in any
improvement in the ship's pace; still it must be owned there was not
much wind to speed us along.

This is an atom: 
At six o'clock this morning I mounted the poop and made as keen a
scrutiny as I could of everything on board.

This is an atom: 
Everything appeared as
usual.

This is an atom: 
The "Chancellor" was running on the larboard tack, and carried
low-sails, top-sails, and gallant-sails.

This is an atom: 
Well braced she was; and under
a fresh, but not uneasy breeze, was making no less than eleven knots an
hour.

This is an atom: 
The young man
enjoyed the early morning air, laden with its briny fragrance, and I
assisted him to mount the poop.

This is an atom: 
In answer to my inquiry as to whether
they had been disturbed by any bustle in the night, Andre replied that
he did not wake at all, and had heard nothing.

This is an atom: 
"I am glad, my boy," said his father, "that you have slept so soundly.

This is an atom: 
I
heard the noise of which Mr.

This is an atom: 
It must have; been about
three o'clock this morning, and it seemed to me as though they were
shouting.

This is an atom: 
I thought I heard them say, 'Here, quick, look to the
hatches!

This is an atom: 
' but as nobody was called up, I presumed that nothing serious
was the matter.

This is an atom: 
"

As he spoke I cast my eye at the panel-slides, which fore and aft of the
main-mast open into the hold.

This is an atom: 
They seemed to be all close as usual,
but I now observed for the first time that they were covered with heavy
tarpauling.

This is an atom: 
Wondering; in my own mind what could be the reason for
these extra precautions I did not say anything to M. Letourneur, but
determined to wait until the mate should come on watch, when he would
doubtless give me, I thought, an explanation of the mystery.

This is an atom: 
The
waning moon was yet above the western horizon, for as it still wants
three days to her last quarter she does not set until 10.57 am.

This is an atom: 
On
consulting my almanac, I find that there will be a new moon on the 24th,
and that on that day, little as it may affect us here in mid ocean, the
phenomenon of the high sygyzian tides will take place on the shores of
every continent and island.

This is an atom: 
At the breakfast hour M. Letourneur and Andre went below for a cup of
tea, and I remained on the poop alone.

This is an atom: 
As I expected, Curtis appeared,
that he might relieve Lieutenant Walter of the watch.

This is an atom: 
I advanced to meet
him, but before he even wished me good morning, I saw him cast a quick
and searching glance upon the deck, and then, with a slightly contracted
brow, proceed to examine the state of the weather and the trim of the
sails.

This is an atom: 
"Where is Captain Huntly?

This is an atom: 
"I have seen nothing of him," answered the lieutenant "is there anything
fresh up?

This is an atom: 
They then conversed for a few moments in an undertone, and I could see
that Walter by his gesture gave a negative answer to some question which
the mate had asked him.

This is an atom: 
"Send me the boatswain, Walter," said Curtis
aloud as the lieutenant moved away.

This is an atom: 
The boatswain immediately appeared, and another conversation was carried
on in whispers.

This is an atom: 
The man repeatedly shook his head as he replied to
Curtis's inquiries, and then, in obedience to orders, called the men
who were on watch, and made them plentifully water the tarpauling that
covered the great hatchway.

This is an atom: 
Curious to fathom the mystery I went up to Curtis and began to talk to
him upon ordinary topics, hoping that he would himself introduce the
subject that was uppermost in my mind; finding, however, that he did not
allude to it; I asked him point blank.

This is an atom: 
"What was the matter in the night, Curtis?

This is an atom: 
"

He looked at me steadily, but made no reply.

This is an atom: 
"What was it?

This is an atom: 
"M. Letourneur and myself were both of us
disturbed by a very unusual commotion overhead.

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh, a mere nothing," he said at length; "the man at the helm had made a
false move, and we had to pipe hands to brace the ship a bit; but it was
soon all put to rights.

This is an atom: 
It was nothing, nothing at all.

This is an atom: 
"

I said no more; but I cannot resist the impression that Robert Curtis
has not acted with me in his usual straightforward manner.

This is an atom: 
There is no change in the "Chancellor's" course, and to an unprejudiced
eye all would appear to be going on as usual.

This is an atom: 
But I have an uneasy
consciousness that something is not quite right.

This is an atom: 
Why should the
hatchways be so hermetically closed as though a mutinous crew was
imprisoned between decks?

This is an atom: 
I cannot help thinking too that there is
something in the sailors so constantly standing in groups and breaking
off their talk so suddenly whenever we approach; and several times I
have caught the word "hatches" which arrested M. Letourneur's attention
on the night of the disturbance.

This is an atom: 
On the 15th, while I was walking on the forecastle, I overheard one of
the sailors, a man named Owen say to his mates,--

"Now I just give you all warning that I am not going to wait until the
last minute.

This is an atom: 
"

"Why, what do you mean to do?

This is an atom: 
" said Owen, "do you suppose that longboats were only made for
porpoises?

This is an atom: 
"

Something at that moment occurred to interrupt the conversation, and I
heard no more.

This is an atom: 
It occurred to me whether there was not some conspiracy
among the crew, of which probably Curtis had already detected the
symptoms.

This is an atom: 
I am quite aware that some sailors are most rebelliously
disposed, and require to be ruled with a rod of iron.

This is an atom: 
Yesterday and to-day I have observed Curtis remonstrating somewhat
vehemently with Captain Huntly, but there is no obvious result arising
from their interviews; the Captain apparently being bent upon some
purpose, of which it is only too manifest that the mate decidedly
disapproves.

This is an atom: 
Captain Huntly is undoubtedly labouring under strong nervous excitement;
and M. Letourneur has more than once remarked how silent he has become
at meal-times; for although Curtis continually endeavours to start some
subject of general interest, yet neither Mr.

This is an atom: 
Ruby are the men to take it up, and consequently the conversation flags
hopelessly, and soon drops.

This is an atom: 
The passengers too are now, with good cause,
beginning to murmur at the length of the voyage, and Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kear, who
considers that the very elements ought to yield to his convenience, lets
the captain know by his consequential and haughty manner that he holds
him responsible for the delay.

This is an atom: 
During the course of yesterday the mate gave repeated orders for the
deck to be watered again and again, and although as a general rule this
is a business which is done, once for all, in the early morning, the
crew did not utter a word of complaint at the additional work thus
imposed upon them.

This is an atom: 
The tarpaulins on the hatches have thus been kept
continually wet, so that their close and heavy texture is rendered quite
impervious to the air, The "Chancellor's" pumps afford a copious supply
of water, so that I should not suppose that even the daintiest and most
luxurious craft belonging to an aristocratic yacht-club was ever subject
to a more thorough scouring.

This is an atom: 
I tried to reconcile myself to the belief
that it was the high temperature of the tropical regions upon which
we are entering, that rendered such extra sousings a necessity, and
recalled to my recollection how, during the night of the 13th, I had
found the atmosphere below deck so stifling that in spite of the heavy
swell I was obliged to open the porthole of my cabin, on the starboard
side, to get a breath of air.

This is an atom: 
The sun had scarcely risen, and
the air was fresh and cool, in strange contrast to the heat which below
the poop had been quite oppressive.

This is an atom: 
The sailors as usual were washing
the deck, A great sheet of water, supplied continuously by the pumps was
rolling in tiny wavelets, and escaping now to starboard, now to larboard
through the scupper-holes.

This is an atom: 
After watching the men for a while as they
ran about bare-footed, I could not resist the desire to join them, so
taking off my shoes and stockings I proceeded to dabble in the flowing
water.

This is an atom: 
Great was my amazement to find the deck perfectly hot to my feet!

This is an atom: 
Curtis
heard my exclamation of surprise, and before I could put my thoughts
into words, said,--

"Yes!

This is an atom: 
The uneasiness of the crew,
their frequent conferences, Owen's mysterious words, the constant
scourings of the deck and the oppressive heat of the cabins which had
been noticed even by my fellow-passengers, all are explained.

This is an atom: 
I shivered with a
thrill of horror; a calamity the most terrible that can befall a voyager
stared me in the face, and it was some seconds before I could recover
sufficient composure to inquire when the fire was first discovered.

This is an atom: 
" I exclaimed; "why, then, it was that night.

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes," he said, interrupting me; "it was the night you heard the
disturbance upon deck.

This is an atom: 
The men on watch noticed a slight smoke issuing
from the large hatchway and immediately called Captain Huntly and
myself.

This is an atom: 
We found beyond all doubt, that the cargo was on fire, and what
was worse, that there was no possibility of getting at the seat of the
combustion.

This is an atom: 
What could we do?

This is an atom: 
Why; we took the only precaution that
was practicable under the circumstances, and resolved most carefully
to exclude every breath of air from penetrating into the hold, For some
time I hoped that we had been successful.

This is an atom: 
I thought that the fire was
stifled; but during the last three days there is every reason to make us
know that it has been gaining strength.

This is an atom: 
Do what we will, the deck gets
hotter and hotter, and unless it were kept constantly wet, it would be
unbearable to the feet.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," he added; "that
you have made the discovery.

This is an atom: 
It is better that you should know it.

This is an atom: 
"

I listened in silence, I was now fully aroused to the gravity of the
situation and thoroughly comprehended how we were in the very face of a
calamity which it seemed that no human power could avert.

This is an atom: 
"Do you know what has caused the fire?

This is an atom: 
"It probably arose," he answered, "from the spontaneous combustion of
the cotton.

This is an atom: 
The case is rare, but it is far from unknown.

This is an atom: 
Unless the
cotton is perfectly dry when it is shipped, its confinement in a damp
or ill-ventilated hold will sometimes cause it to ignite; and I have no
doubt it is this that has brought about our misfortune.

This is an atom: 
Is there nothing to be done?

This is an atom: 
"As I told you before, we have adopted
the only possible measure within our power to check the fire.

This is an atom: 
At one
time I thought of knocking a hole in the ship's timbers just on
her waterline, and letting in just as much water as the pumps could
afterwards get rid of again; but we found the combustion was right
in the middle of the cargo and that we should be obliged to flood
the entire hold before we could get at the right place.

This is an atom: 
That scheme
consequently was no good.

This is an atom: 
During the night, I had the deck bored in
various places and water poured down through the holes; but that again
seemed all of no use.

This is an atom: 
There is only one thing that can be done; we must
persevere in excluding most carefully every breath of outer air, so that
perhaps the conflagration deprived of oxygen may smoulder itself out.

This is an atom: 
That is our only hope.

This is an atom: 
"

"But, you say the fire is increasing?

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes; and that shows that in spite of all our care there is some
aperture which we have not been able to discover, by which, somehow or
other, air gets into the hold.

This is an atom: 
"

"Have you ever heard of a vessel surviving such circumstances?

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," said Curtis; "it is not at all an unusual thing for
ships laden with cotton to arrive at Liverpool or Havre with a portion
of their cargo consumed; and I have myself known more than one captain
run into port with his deck scorching his very feet, and who, to save
his vessel and the remainder of his freight has been compelled to unload
with the utmost expedition.

This is an atom: 
But, in such cases, of course the fire has
been more or less under control throughout the voyage; with us, it
is increasing day by day, and I tell you I am convinced there is an
aperture somewhere which has escaped our notice.

This is an atom: 
"

"But would it not be advisable for us to retrace our course, and make
for the nearest land?

This is an atom: 
"Walter and I, and the boatswain, are
going to talk the matter over seriously with the captain to-day.

This is an atom: 
But,
between ourselves, I have taken the responsibility upon myself; I have
already changed the tack to the south-west; we are now straight before
the wind, and consequently we are sailing towards the coast.

This is an atom: 
"

"I need hardly ask," I added; "whether any of the other passengers are
at all aware of the imminent danger in which we are placed.

This is an atom: 
"

"None of them," he said; "not in the least; and I hope you will not
enlighten them.

This is an atom: 
We don't want terrified women and cowardly men to add to
our embarrassment; the crew are under orders to keep a strict silence on
the subject.

This is an atom: 
"

I promised to keep the matter a profound secret, as I fully entered into
Curtis's views as to the absolute necessity for concealment.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER X.

OCTOBER 20th AND 21st.--The "Chancellor" is now crowded with all the
canvas she can carry, and at times her top-masts threaten to snap with
the pressure.

This is an atom: 
But Curtis is ever on the alert; he never leaves his post
beside the man at the helm, and without compromising the safety of the
vessel, he contrives by tacking to the breeze, to urge her on at her
utmost speed.

This is an atom: 
All day long on the 20th, the passengers were assembled on the poop.

This is an atom: 
Evidently they found the heat of the cabins painfully oppressive, and
most of them lay stretched upon benches and quietly enjoyed the gentle
rolling of the vessel.

This is an atom: 
The increasing heat of the deck did not reveal
itself to their well-shod feet and the constant scouring of the boards
did not excite any suspicion in their torpid minds.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur, it
is true, did express his surprise that the crew of an ordinary merchant
vessel should be distinguished by such extraordinary cleanliness, but as
I replied to him in a very casual tone, he passed no further remark.

This is an atom: 
I
could not help regretting that I had given Curtis my pledge of silence,
and longed intensely to communicate the melancholy secret to
the energetic Frenchman; for at times when I reflect upon the
eight-and-twenty victims who may probably, only too soon, be a prey to
the relentless flames, my heart seems ready to burst.

This is an atom: 
The important consultation between captain, mate, lieutenant, and
boatswain has taken place.

This is an atom: 
Curtis has confided the result to me.

This is an atom: 
He says
that Huntly, the captain, is completely demoralized; he has lost all
power and energy; and practically leaves the command of the ship to him.

This is an atom: 
It is now certain the fire is beyond control, and that sooner or
later it will burst out in full violence The temperature of the crew's
quarters has already become almost unbearable.

This is an atom: 
One solitary hope
remained; it is that we may reach the shore before the final catastrophe
occurs.

This is an atom: 
The Lesser Antilles are the nearest land; and although they
are some five or six hundred miles away, if the wind remains north-east
there is yet a chance of reaching them in time.

This is an atom: 
Carrying royals and studding-sails, the "Chancellor" during the last
four-and-twenty hours has held a steady course.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur is the
only one of all the passengers who has remarked the change of tack;
Curtis however, has set all speculation on his part to rest by telling
him that he wanted to get ahead of the wind, and that he was tacking to
the west to catch a favourable current.

This is an atom: 
To-day, the 21st, all has gone on as usual; and as far as the
observation of the passengers has reached, the ordinary routine has been
undisturbed.

This is an atom: 
Curtis indulges the hope even yet that by excluding the
air, the fire may be stifled before it ignites the general cargo; he has
hermetically closed every accessible aperture, and has even taken the
precaution of plugging the orifices of the pumps, under the impression
that their suction-tubes, running as they do to the bottom of the
hold, may possibly be channels for conveying some molecules of air.

This is an atom: 
Altogether, he considers it a good sign that the combustion has not
betrayed itself by some external issue of smoke.

This is an atom: 
The day would have passed without any incident worth recording if I had
not chanced to overhear a fragment of a conversation which demonstrated
that our situation hitherto precarious enough, had now become most
appalling.

This is an atom: 
As I was sitting on the poop, two of my fellow-passengers, Falsten,
the engineer, and Ruby, the merchant whom I had observed to be often in
company, were engaged in conversation almost close to me.

This is an atom: 
What they said
was evidently not intended for my hearing, but my attention was directed
towards them by some very emphatic gestures of dissatisfaction on the
part of Falsten, and I could not forbear listening to what followed.

This is an atom: 
" exclaimed Falsten; "nothing could be more
imprudent.

This is an atom: 
" replied Ruby; "it's all right; it is not the first time I
have done it.

This is an atom: 
"

"But don't you know that any shock at any time might cause an
explosion?

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh, it's all properly secured," said Ruby, "tight enough; I have no
fears on that score, Mr.

This is an atom: 
"

"But why," asked Falsten, "did you not inform the captain?

This is an atom: 
"

"Just because if I had informed him, he would not have taken the case on
board.

This is an atom: 
"

The wind dropped for a few seconds; and for a brief interval I could
not catch what passed; but I could see that Falsten continued to
remonstrate, whilst Ruby answered by shrugging his shoulders.

This is an atom: 
At length
I heard Falsten say,--

"Well, at any rate the captain must be informed of this, and the package
shall be thrown overboard.

This is an atom: 
I don't want, to be blown up.

This is an atom: 
To what could the engineer be alluding?

This is an atom: 
Evidently he had not
the remotest suspicion that the cargo was already on fire.

This is an atom: 
and with an
involuntary impulse I rushed up to Ruby, and seized him by the shoulder.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said Falsten, "a case containing thirty pounds.

This is an atom: 
"

"Where is it?

This is an atom: 
What my feelings were I cannot describe; but it was hardly in terror so
much as with a kind of resignation that I made my way to Curtis on
the forecastle, and made him aware that the alarming character of our
situation was now complete, as there was enough explosive matter on
board to blow up a mountain.

This is an atom: 
Curtis received the information as coolly
as it was delivered, and after I had made him acquainted with all the
particulars said,--

"Not a word of this must be mentioned to any one else, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon,
where is Ruby now?

This is an atom: 
"

Ruby and Falsten were sitting just as I had left them.

This is an atom: 
Curtis walked
straight up to Ruby, and asked him whether what he had been told was
true.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, quite true," said Ruby, complacently, thinking that the worst
that could befall him would be that he might be convicted of a little
smuggling.

This is an atom: 
I observed that Curtis was obliged for a moment or two to clasp his
hands tightly together behind his back to prevent himself from
seizing the unfortunate passenger by the throat; but suppressing his
indignation, he proceeded quietly, though sternly, to interrogate him
about the facts of the case.

This is an atom: 
Ruby only confirmed what I had already told
him.

This is an atom: 
With characteristic Anglo-Saxon incautiousness he had brought
on board with the rest of his baggage, a case containing no less than
thirty pounds of picrate, and had allowed the explosive matter to be
stowed in the hold with as little compunction as a Frenchman would feel
in smuggling a single bottle of wine.

This is an atom: 
He had not informed the captain
of the dangerous nature of the contents of the package, because he was
perfectly aware that he would have been refused permission to bring the
package on board.

This is an atom: 
"Any way," he said, with a shrug of his shoulders, "you can't hang me
for it; and if the package gives you so much concern, you are quite at
liberty to throw it into the sea.

This is an atom: 
"

I was beside myself with fury, and not being endowed with Curtis's
reticence and self-control, before he could interfere to stop me, I
cried out,--

"You fool!

This is an atom: 
don't you know that there is fire on board?

This is an atom: 
Most earnestly I wished them
unuttered, But it was too late: their effect upon Ruby was electrical.

This is an atom: 
He was paralyzed with terror his limbs stiffened convulsively; his eye
was dilated; he gasped for breath, and was speechless.

This is an atom: 
All of a
sudden he threw up his arms and, as though he momentarily expected an
explosion, he darted down from the poop, and paced frantically up and down
the deck, gesticulating like a madman, and shouting,--

"Fire on board!

This is an atom: 
"

On hearing the outcry, all the crew, supposing that the fire had now
in reality broken out, rushed on deck; the rest of the passengers soon
joined them, and the scene that ensued was one of the utmost confusion.

This is an atom: 
Kear fell down senseless on the deck, and her husband, occupied in
looking after himself, left her to the tender mercies of Miss Herbey.

This is an atom: 
Curtis endeavoured to silence Ruby's ravings, whilst I, in as few words
as I could, made M. Letourneur aware of the extent to which the cargo
was on fire.

This is an atom: 
The father's first thought was for Andre but the young
man preserved an admirable composure, and begged his father not to be
alarmed, as the danger was not immediate.

This is an atom: 
Meanwhile the sailors had
loosened all the tacklings of the long-boat; and were preparing to
launch it, when Curtis's voice was heard peremptorily bidding them to
desist; he assured them that the fire had made no further progress; that
Mr.

This is an atom: 
Ruby had been unduly excited and not conscious of what he had said;
and he pledged his word that when the right moment should arrive he
would allow them all to leave the ship; but that moment, he said, had
not yet come.

This is an atom: 
At the sound of a voice which they had learned to honour and respect,
the crew paused in their operations, and the long-boat remained
suspended in its place.

This is an atom: 
Fortunately, even Ruby himself in the midst
of his ravings, had not dropped a word about the picrate that had
been deposited in the hold; for although the mate had a power over the
sailors that Captain Huntly had never possessed, I feel certain that if
the true state of the case had been known, nothing on earth would
have prevented some of them, in their consternation, from effecting an
escape.

This is an atom: 
As it was, only Curtis, Falsten, and myself were cognizant of
the terrible secret.

This is an atom: 
As soon as order was restored, the mate and, I joined Falsten on the
poop, where he had remained throughout the panic, and where we found
him with folded arms, deep in thought, as it might be, solving some hard
mechanical problem.

This is an atom: 
He promised, at my request, that he would reveal
nothing of the new danger to which we were exposed through Ruby's
imprudence.

This is an atom: 
Curtis himself took the responsibility of informing Captain
Huntly of our critical situation.

This is an atom: 
In order to insure complete secrecy, it was necessary to secure the
person of the unhappy Ruby, who, quite beside himself, continued to rave
up and down the deck with the incessant cry of "Fire!

This is an atom: 
" Accordingly
Curtis gave orders to some of his men to seize him and gag him; and
before he could make any resistance the miserable man was captured and
safely lodged in confinement in his own cabin.

This is an atom: 
OCTOBER 22nd.--Curtis has told the captain everything; for he persists
in ostensibly recognizing him as his superior officer, and refuses
to conceal from him our true situation.

This is an atom: 
Captain Huntly received the
communication in perfect silence, and merely passing his hand across his
forehead as though to, banish some distressing thought, re-entered his
cabin without a word.

This is an atom: 
Curtis, Lieutenant Walter, Falsten, and myself have been discussing
the chances of our safety, and I am surprised to find with how much
composure we can all survey our anxious predicament.

This is an atom: 
"There is no doubt" said Curtis, "that we must abandon all hope
of arresting the fire; the heat towards the bow has already become
well-nigh unbearable, and the time must come when the flames will find
a vent through the deck.

This is an atom: 
If the sea is calm enough for us to make use
of the boats, well and good; we shall of course get quit of the ship as
quietly as we can; if on the other hand, the weather should be adverse,
or the wind be boisterous, we must stick to our place, and contend with
the flames to the very last; perhaps, after all, we shall fare better
with the fire as a declared enemy than as a hidden one.

This is an atom: 
"

Falsten and I agreed with what he said, but I pointed out to him that
he had quite overlooked the fact of there being thirty pounds of
combustible matter in the hold.

This is an atom: 
"No" he gravely replied, "I have not forgotten it, but it is a
circumstance of which I do not trust myself to think I dare not run
the risk of admitting air into the hold by going down to search for the
powder, and yet I know not at what moment it may explode.

This is an atom: 
No; it is a
matter that I cannot take at all into my reckoning, it must remain in
higher hands than mine.

This is an atom: 
"

We bowed our heads in a silence which was solemn.

This is an atom: 
In the present state
of the weather, immediate flight was, we knew, impossible.

This is an atom: 
After a considerable pause, Falsten, as calmly as though he were
delivering some philosophic dogma, observed,--

"The explosion, if I may use the formula of science, is not necessary,
but contingent.

This is an atom: 
Falsten," I asked, "is it possible for picrate of
potash to ignite without concussion?

This is an atom: 
"

"Certainly it is," replied the engineer.

This is an atom: 
"Under-ordinary circumstances,
picrate of potash although not MORE inflammable than common powder, yet
possesses the same degree of inflammability.

This is an atom: 
"

We now prepared to go on deck.

This is an atom: 
As we left the saloon, in which we had
been sitting, Curtis seized my hand.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," he exclaimed, "if you only knew the bitterness of
the agony I feel at seeing this fine vessel doomed to be devoured by
flames, and at being so powerless to save her.

This is an atom: 
" Then quickly recovering
himself, he continued, "But I am forgetting myself; you, if no other,
must know what I am suffering.

This is an atom: 
It is all over now," he said more
cheerfully.

This is an atom: 
"It is just this," he answered deliberately "we are over a mine, and
already the match has been applied to the train.

This is an atom: 
How long that train may
be, 'tis not for me to say.

This is an atom: 
The other passengers, in common with the crew, are still in entire
ignorance of the extremity of peril to which we are exposed, although
they are all aware that there is fire in the hold.

This is an atom: 
As soon as the fact
was announced, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kear, after communicating to Curtis his instructions
that he thought he should have the fire immediately extinguished and
intimating that he held him responsible for all contingencies that might
happen, retired to his cabin, where he has remained ever since, fully
occupied in collecting and packing together the more cherished articles
of his property and without the semblance of a care or a thought for his
unfortunate wife, whose condition, in spite of her ludicrous complaints,
was truly pitiable.

This is an atom: 
Miss Herbey, however, is unrelaxing in her
attentions, and the unremitted diligence with which she fulfills her
offices of duty, commands my highest admiration.

This is an atom: 
OCTOBER 23rd.--This morning, Captain Huntly sent for Curtis into his
cabin, and the mate has since made me acquainted with what passed
between them.

This is an atom: 
"Curtis," began the captain, his haggard eye betraying only too plainly
some mental derangement, "I am a sailor, am I not?

This is an atom: 
"I do not know how it is," continued the captain, "but I seem
bewildered; I cannot recollect anything.

This is an atom: 
And have we kept a north-easterly direction since we
left?

This is an atom: 
"

"No, sir, according to your orders we have been sailing south-east, and
here we are in the tropics.

This is an atom: 
"

"And what is the name of the ship?

This is an atom: 
Well, Curtis, I really can't take
her back to the north.

This is an atom: 
I hate the sea, the very sight of it makes me
ill, I would much rather not leave my cabin.

This is an atom: 
"

Curtis went on to tell me how he had tried to persuade him that with a
little time and care he would soon recover his indisposition, and feel
himself again; but the captain had interrupted him by saying,--

"Well, well; we shall see by-and-by; but for the present you must take
this for my positive order; you must, from this time, at once take
the command of the ship, and act just as if I were not on board.

This is an atom: 
My brain is all in a whirl, you
cannot tell what I am suffering;" and the unfortunate man pressed both
his hands convulsively against his forehead.

This is an atom: 
"I weighed the matter carefully for a moment," added Curtis, "and seeing
what his condition too truly was, I acquiesced in all that he required
and withdrew, promising him that all his orders should be obeyed.

This is an atom: 
"

After hearing these particulars, I could not help remarking how
fortunate it was that the captain had resigned of his own accord, for
although he might not be actually insane, it was very evident that his
brain was in a very morbid condition.

This is an atom: 
"I succeed him at a very critical moment;" said Curtis thoughtfully;
"but I shall endeavour to do my duty.

This is an atom: 
"

A short time afterwards he sent for the boatswain, and ordered him to
assemble the crew at the foot of the main-mast.

This is an atom: 
As soon as the men were
together, he addressed them very calmly, but very firmly.

This is an atom: 
"My men," he said, "I have to tell you that Captain Huntly, on account
of the dangerous situation in which circumstances have placed us, and
for other reasons known to myself, has thought right to resign his
command to me.

This is an atom: 
"

Thus quietly and simply the change was effected, and we have the
satisfaction of knowing that the "Chancellor" is now under the command
of a conscientious, energetic man, who will shirk nothing that he
believes to be for our common good.

This is an atom: 
Falsten,
and myself immediately offered him our best wishes, in which Lieutenant
Walter and the boatswain most cordially joined.

This is an atom: 
The ship still holds her course south-west and Curtis crowds on all
sail and makes as speedily as possible for the nearest of the Lesser
Antilles.

This is an atom: 
OCTOBER 24th to 29th.--For the last five days the sea has been very
heavy, and although the "Chancellor" sails with wind and wave in her
favour, yet her progress is considerably impeded.

This is an atom: 
Here on board this
veritable fireship I cannot help contemplating with a longing eye this
vast ocean that surrounds us.

This is an atom: 
"Why not bore the deck?

This is an atom: 
"Why not admit the water by
tons into the hold?

This is an atom: 
What could be the harm?

This is an atom: 
The fire would be quenched;
and what would be easier than to pump the water out again?

This is an atom: 
"

"I have already told you, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," said Curtis, "that the very
moment we admit the air, the flames will rush forth to the very top of
the masts.

This is an atom: 
There is
nothing whatever to be done, except to close every aperture.

This is an atom: 
"

The fire continued to progress even more rapidly than we had hitherto
suspected.

This is an atom: 
The heat gradually drove the passengers nearly all, on deck,
and the two stern cabins, lighted, as I said, by their windows in the
aft-board were the only quarters below that were inhabitable.

This is an atom: 
Kear occupied one, and Curtis reserved the other for Ruby, who,
a raving maniac, had to be kept rigidly under restraint.

This is an atom: 
I went down
occasionally to see him, but invariably found him in a state of abject
terror, uttering horrible shrieks, as though possessed with the idea
that he was being scorched by the most excruciating heat.

This is an atom: 
He was always calm
and spoke quite rationally upon any subject except his own profession;
but in connexion with that he prated away the merest nonsense.

This is an atom: 
He
suffered greatly, but steadily declined all my offers of attention, and
pertinaciously refused to leave his cabin.

This is an atom: 
To-day, an acrid, nauseating smoke made its way through the panellings
that partition off the quarters of the crew.

This is an atom: 
At once Curtis ordered the
partition to be enveloped in wet tarpaulin, but the fumes penetrated
even this, and filled the whole neighbourhood of the ship's bows with
a reeking vapour that was positively stifling.

This is an atom: 
As we listened, too, we
could hear a dull rumbling sound, but we were as mystified as ever to
comprehend where the air could have entered that was evidently fanning
the flames.

This is an atom: 
Only too certainly, it was now becoming a question not
of days nor even of hours before we must be prepared for the final
catastrophe.

This is an atom: 
The sea was still running high, and escape by the boats was
plainly impossible.

This is an atom: 
Fortunately, as I have said, the main-mast and the
mizzen are of iron; otherwise the heat at their base would long ago
have brought them down and our chances of safety would have been
much imperiled; but by crowding on sail the "Chancellor" in the full
north-east wind continued to make her way with undiminished speed.

This is an atom: 
It is now a fortnight since the fire was first discovered, and the
proper working of the ship has gradually become a more and more
difficult matter.

This is an atom: 
Even with thick shoes any attempt to walk upon deck up
to the forecastle was soon impracticable, and the poop, simply because
its door is elevated somewhat above the level of the hold, is now the
only available standing-place.

This is an atom: 
Water began to lose its effect upon the
scorched and shrivelling planks; the resin oozed out from the knots
in the wood, the seams burst open, and the tar, melted by the heat,
followed the rollings of the vessel, and formed fantastic patterns about
the deck.

This is an atom: 
Then to complete our perplexity, the wind shifted suddenly round to the
north-west, whence it blew a perfect hurricane.

This is an atom: 
To no purpose did Curtis
do everything in his power to bring the ship ahull; every effort was
vain; the "Chancellor" could not bear her trysail, so there was nothing
to be done but to let her go with the wind, and drift further and
further from the land for which we are longing so eagerly.

This is an atom: 
To-day, the 29th, the tempest seemed to reach its height; the waves
appeared to us mountains high, and dashed the spray most violently
across the deck.

This is an atom: 
As for the picrate,
for the time we have quite forgotten its existence; indeed it might
almost seem as though its explosion would come as a relief, for no
catastrophe, however terrible, could far exceed the torture of our
suspense.

This is an atom: 
While he had still the remaining chance, Curtis rescued from the
store-room such few provisions as the heat of the compartment allowed
him to obtain; and a lot of cases of salt meat and biscuits, a cask of
brandy, some barrels of fresh water, together with some sails and wraps,
a compass and other instruments are now lying packed in a mass all ready
for prompt removal to the boats whenever we shall be obliged to leave
the ship.

This is an atom: 
About eight o'clock in the evening, a noise is heard, distinct even
above the raging of the hurricane.

This is an atom: 
The panels of the deck are upheaved,
and volumes of black smoke issue upwards as if from a safety-valve.

This is an atom: 
An
universal consternation seizes one and all: we must leave the volcano
which is about to burst beneath our feet.

This is an atom: 
He hesitates; looks first at the huge and threatening waves;
looks then at the boats.

This is an atom: 
The long-boat is there, suspended right along
the centre of the deck; but it is impossible to approach it now;
the yawl, however, hoisted on the starboard side, and the whale-boat
suspended aft, are still available.

This is an atom: 
"Stop, stop," shouts Curtis; "do you mean to cut off our last and only
chance of safety?

This is an atom: 
Would you launch a boat in such a sea as this?

This is an atom: 
"

A few of them, with Owen at their head, give no heed to what he says.

This is an atom: 
Rushing to the poop, and seizing a cutlass, Curtis shouts again,--

"Touch the tackling of the davit, one of you; only touch it, and I'll
cleave your skull.

This is an atom: 
"

Awed by his determined manner, the men retire, some clambering into the
shrouds, whilst others mount to the very top of the masts.

This is an atom: 
At eleven o'clock, several loud reports are heard, caused by the
bursting asunder of the partitions of the hold.

This is an atom: 
Clouds of smoke issue
from the front, followed by a long tongue of lambent flame that seems to
encircle the mizzen-mast.

This is an atom: 
The fire now reaches to the cabin occupied by
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Kear, who, shrieking wildly, is brought on deck by Miss Herbey.

This is an atom: 
A moment more, and Silas Huntly makes his appearance, his face all
blackened with the grimy smoke; he bows to Curtis, as he passes, and
then proceeds in the calmest manner to mount the aft-shrouds, and
installs himself at the very top of the mizzen.

This is an atom: 
The sight of Huntly recalls to my recollection the prisoner still below,
and my first impulse is to rush to the staircase and do what I can to
set him free.

This is an atom: 
But the maniac has already eluded his confinement, and
with singed hair and his clothes already alight, rushes upon deck.

This is an atom: 
Like
a salamander he passes across the burning deck with unscathed feet,
and glides through the stifling smoke with unchoked breath.

This is an atom: 
Another loud report; the long-boat is shivered into fragments; the
middle panel bursts the tarpaulin that covered it, and a stream of fire,
free at length from the restraint that had held it, rises half-mast
high.

This is an atom: 
" shrieks the madman; "we shall all be blown
up!

This is an atom: 
"

And in an instant, before we can get near him, he has hurled himself,
through the open hatchway, down into the fiery furnace below.

This is an atom: 
OCTOBER 29th:--NIGHT.--The scene, as night came on, was terrible indeed.

This is an atom: 
Notwithstanding the desperateness of our situation, however, there
was not one of us so paralyzed by fear, but that we fully realized the
horror of it all.

This is an atom: 
Poor Ruby, indeed, is lost and gone, but his last words were productive
of serious consequences.

This is an atom: 
" and being thus for the first time made aware of the true
nature of their peril, they resolved at every hazard to accomplish their
escape.

This is an atom: 
Beside themselves with terror, they either did not or would
not, see that no boat could brave the tremendous waves that were raging
around, and accordingly they made a frantic rush towards the yawl.

This is an atom: 
Curtis again made a vigorous endeavour to prevent them, but this time
all in vain; Owen urged them on, and already the tackling was loosened,
so that the boat was swung over to the ship's side, For a moment it hung
suspended in mid-air, and then, with a final effort from the sailors, it
was quickly lowered into the sea.

This is an atom: 
But scarcely had it touched the water,
when it was caught by an enormous wave which, recoiling with resistless
violence, dashed it to atoms against the "Chancellor's" side.

This is an atom: 
The men stood aghast; they were dumbfoundered.

This is an atom: 
Long-boat and yawl both
gone, there was nothing now remaining to us but a small whale-boat.

This is an atom: 
Not
a word was spoken; not a sound was heard but the hoarse whistling of
the wind, and the mournful roaring of the flames.

This is an atom: 
From the centre of the
ship, which was hollowed out like a furnace, there issued a column of
sooty vapour that ascended to the sky.

This is an atom: 
Kear
was lying senseless on one of the hen-coops, with Miss Herbey sitting
passively at her side; M. Letourneur held his son tightly clasped to his
bosom.

This is an atom: 
I saw Falsten calmly consult his watch, and note down the time
in his memorandum-book, but I was far from sharing his, composure, for I
was overcome by a nervous agitation that I could not suppress.

This is an atom: 
As far as we knew, Lieutenant Walter, the boatswain, and such of the
crew as were not with us, were safe in the bow; but it was impossible
to tell how they were faring because the sheet of fire intervened like a
curtain, and cut off all communication between stem and stern.

This is an atom: 
I broke the dismal silence, saying "All over now, Curtis.

This is an atom: 
"

"No, sir, not yet," he replied, "now that the panel is open we will set
to work, and pour water with all our might down into the furnace, and
may be, we shall put it out, even yet.

This is an atom: 
"

"But how can you work your pumps while the deck is burning?

This is an atom: 
and how can
you get at your men beyond that sheet of flame?

This is an atom: 
"

He made no answer to my impetuous questions, and finding that he had
nothing more to say, I repeated that it was all over now.

This is an atom: 
After a pause, he said, "As long as a plank of the ship remains to stand
on, Mr.

This is an atom: 
"

But the conflagration raged with redoubled fury, the sea around us was
lighted with a crimson glow, and the clouds above shone with a lurid
glare.

This is an atom: 
Long jets of fire darted across the hatchways, and we were forced
to take refuge on the taffrail at the extreme end of the poop.

This is an atom: 
Kear was laid in the whale-boat that hung from the stern, Miss Herbey
persisting to the last in retaining her post by her side.

This is an atom: 
The
"Chancellor" under bare poles, was driven, like a gigantic fire-ship
with frightful velocity across the raging ocean; her very speed as it
were, making common cause with the hurricane to fan the fire that was
consuming her.

This is an atom: 
Soon there could be no alternative between throwing
ourselves into the sea, or perishing in the flames.

This is an atom: 
But where, all this time, was the picrate?

This is an atom: 
perhaps, after all, Ruby
had deceived us and there was no volcano, such as we dreaded, below our
feet.

This is an atom: 
At half-past eleven, when the tempest seems at its very height there
is heard a peculiar roar distinguishable even above the crash of the
elements.

This is an atom: 
Curtis leaps on to the netting, casts a rapid glance at the snow-white
billows, and turning to the helmsman shouts with all his might
"Starboard the helm!

This is an atom: 
There is a sudden shock; the ship is caught up by an
enormous wave; she rises upon her beam ends; several times she strikes
the ground; the mizzen-mast snaps short off level with the deck, falls
into the sea, and the "Chancellor" is motionless.

This is an atom: 
THE NIGHT OF THE 29th CONTINUED.--It was not yet midnight; the darkness
was most profound, and we could see nothing.

This is an atom: 
But was it probable that we
had stranded on the coast of America?

This is an atom: 
Very shortly after the ship had thus come to a standstill a clanking of
chains was heard proceeding from her bows.

This is an atom: 
"That is well," said Curtis; "Walter and the boatswain have cast both
the anchors.

This is an atom: 
Let us hope they will hold.

This is an atom: 
"

Then, clinging to the netting, he clambered along the starboard side,
on which the ship had heeled, as far as the flames would allow him.

This is an atom: 
He
clung to the holdfasts of the shrouds, and in spite of the heavy
seas that dashed against the vessel he maintained his position for a
considerable time, evidently listening to some sound that had caught
his ear in the midst of the tempest.

This is an atom: 
"Heaven be praised!

This is an atom: 
" he said, "the water is coming in, and perhaps may
get the better of the fire.

This is an atom: 
"

"True," said I, "but what then?

This is an atom: 
"

"That," he replied, "is a question for by-and-by.

This is an atom: 
"

Already I fancied that the violence of the flames was somewhat abated,
and that the two opposing elements were in fierce contention.

This is an atom: 
Some plank
in the ship's side was evidently stove in, admitting free passage for
the waves.

This is an atom: 
But how, when the water had mastered the fire, should we be
able to master the water?

This is an atom: 
Our natural course would be to use the
pumps, but these, in the very midst of the conflagration, were quite
unavailable.

This is an atom: 
For three long hours, in anxious suspense, we watched and watched, and
waited.

This is an atom: 
Where we were we could not tell.

This is an atom: 
One thing alone was certain:
the tide was ebbing beneath us, and the waves were relaxing in their
violence.

This is an atom: 
Once let the fire be extinguished, and then, perhaps, there
would be room to hope that the next high tide would set us afloat.

This is an atom: 
Towards half-past four in the morning the curtain of fire and smoke,
which had shut off communication between the two extremities of the
ship, became less dense, and we could faintly distinguish that party
of the crew who had taken refuge in the forecastle; and before long,
although it was impracticable to step upon the deck, the lieutenant and
the boatswain contrived to clamber over the gunwale, along the rails,
and joined Curtis on the poop.

This is an atom: 
Here they held a consultation, to which I was admitted.

This is an atom: 
They were all
of opinion that nothing could be done until daylight should give us
something of an idea of our actual position.

This is an atom: 
If we then found that we
were near the shore, we would, weather permitting, endeavour to land,
either in the boat or upon a raft.

This is an atom: 
If, on the other hand, no land were
in sight, and the "Chancellor" were ascertained to be stranded on some
isolated reef, all we could do would be to get her afloat, and put her
into condition for reaching the nearest coast.

This is an atom: 
Curtis told us that it
was long since he had been able to take any observation of altitude, but
there was no doubt the north-west wind had driven us far to the south;
and he thought, as he was ignorant of the existence of any reef in this
part of the Atlantic, that it was just possible that we had been driven
on to the coast of some portion of South America.

This is an atom: 
I reminded him that we were in momentary expectation of an explosion,
and suggested that it would be advisable to abandon the ship and take
refuge on the reef.

This is an atom: 
But he would not hear of such a proceeding, said
that the reef would probably be covered at high tide, and persisted in
the original resolution, that no decided action could be taken before
the daylight appeared.

This is an atom: 
None of them seem to realize the new danger to which the
"Chancellor" may be exposed by being cast upon an unknown reef, hundreds
of miles it may be from land.

This is an atom: 
All are for the time possessed with one
idea, one hope; and that is, that the fire may now be quenched and the
explosion averted.

This is an atom: 
And certainly their hopes seem in a fair way of being fulfilled.

This is an atom: 
Already
the raging flames that poured forth from the hatches have given place
to dense black smoke, and although occasionally some fiery streaks dart
across the dusky fumes, yet they are instantly extinguished.

This is an atom: 
The waves
are doing what pumps and buckets could never have effected; by their
inundation they are steadily stifling the fire which was as steadily
spreading to the whole bulk of the 1700 bales of cotton.

This is an atom: 
OCTOBER 30th.--At the first gleam of daylight we eagerly scanned the
southern and western horizons, but the morning mists limited our view.

This is an atom: 
Land was nowhere to be seen.

This is an atom: 
The tide was now almost at its lowest ebb,
and the colour of the few peaks of rock that jutted up around us showed
that the reef on which we had stranded was of basaltic formation.

This is an atom: 
There
were now only about six feet of water around the "Chancellor," though
with a full freight she draws about fifteen.

This is an atom: 
It was remarkable how far
she had been carried on to the shelf of rock, but the number of times
that she had touched the bottom before she finally ran aground left us
no doubt that she had been lifted up and borne along on the top of an
enormous wave.

This is an atom: 
She now lies with her stern considerably higher than her
bows, a position which renders walking upon the deck anything but an
easy matter; moreover as the tide-receded she heeled over so much to
larboard that at one time Curtis feared she would altogether capsize;
that fear, however, since the tide has reached its lowest mark, has
happily proved groundless.

This is an atom: 
At six o'clock some violent blows were felt against the ship's side, and
at the same time a voice was distinguished, shouting loudly, "Curtis!

This is an atom: 
" Following the direction of the cries we saw that the broken
mizzen-mast was being washed against the vessel, and in the dusky morning
twilight we could make out the figure of a man clinging to the rigging.

This is an atom: 
Curtis, at the peril of his life, hastened to bring the man on board,
It proved to be none other than Silas Huntly, who, after being carried
overboard with the mast, had thus, almost by a miracle, escaped a
watery grave.

This is an atom: 
Without a word of thanks to his deliverer, the ex-captain,
passive, like an automaton, passed on and took his seat in the most
secluded corner of the poop.

This is an atom: 
The broken mizzen may, perhaps, be of
service to us at some future time, and with that idea it has been
rescued from the waves and lashed securely to the stern.

This is an atom: 
By this time it was light enough to see for a distance of three miles
round; but as yet nothing could be discerned to make us think that
we were near a coast.

This is an atom: 
The line of breakers ran for about a mile from
south-west to north-east, and two hundred fathoms to the north of the
ship an irregular mass of rocks formed a small islet.

This is an atom: 
This islet rose
about fifty feet above the sea, and was consequently above the level of
the highest tides; whilst a sort of causeway, available at low water,
would enable us to reach the island, if necessity required.

This is an atom: 
But
there the reef ended; beyond it the sea again resumed its sombre hue,
betokening deep water.

This is an atom: 
In all probability, then, this was a solitary
shoal, unattached to a shore, and the gloom of a bitter disappointment
began to weigh upon our spirits.

This is an atom: 
In another hour the mists had totally disappeared, and it was broad
daylight.

This is an atom: 
I and M. Letourneur stood watching Curtis as he continued
eagerly to scan the western horizon.

This is an atom: 
Astonishment was written on his
countenance; to him it appeared perfectly incredible that, after our
course for so long had been due south from the Bermudas, no land should
be in sight.

This is an atom: 
But not a speck, however minute, broke the clearly-defined
line that joined sea and sky.

This is an atom: 
For several minutes he remained there examining the open space
around, then seizing one of the backstays he glided down and rejoined us
on the poop.

This is an atom: 
Kear interposed, and in a gruff, ill-tempered tone,
asked Curtis where we were.

This is an atom: 
Curtis replied that he did not know.

This is an atom: 
Then all I can say is that you ought to know!

This is an atom: 
"That may be, sir; but at present I am as ignorant of our whereabouts as
you are yourself," said Curtis.

This is an atom: 
Kear, "just please to know that I don't want to stay
for ever on your everlasting ship, so I beg you will make haste and
start off again.

This is an atom: 
"

Curtis condescended to make no other reply than a shrug of the
shoulders, and turning away he informed M. Letourneur and myself that if
the sun came out he intended to take its altitude and find out to what
part of the ocean we had been driven.

This is an atom: 
His next care was to distribute
preserved meat and biscuit amongst the passengers and crew already half
fainting with hunger and fatigue, and then he set to work to devise
measures for setting the ship afloat.

This is an atom: 
The conflagration was greatly abated; no flames now appeared, and
although some black smoke still issued from the interior, yet its volume
was far less than before.

This is an atom: 
The first step was to discover how much water
had entered the hold.

This is an atom: 
The deck was still too hot to walk upon; but
after two hours' irrigation the boards became sufficiently cool for the
boatswain to proceed to take some soundings, and he shortly afterwards
announced that there were five feet of water below.

This is an atom: 
This the captain
determined should not be pumped out at present, as he wanted it
thoroughly to do its duty before he got rid of it.

This is an atom: 
The next subject for consideration was whether it would be advisable to
abandon the vessel, and to take refuge on the reef.

This is an atom: 
Curtis thought not;
and the lieutenant and the boatswain agreed with him.

This is an atom: 
The chances of an
explosion were greatly diminished, as it had been ascertained that the
water had reached that part of the hold in which Ruby's luggage had been
deposited; while, on the other hand, in the event of rough weather,
our position even upon the most elevated points of rock might be very
critical.

This is an atom: 
It was accordingly resolved that both passengers and crew were
safest on board.

This is an atom: 
Acting upon this decision we proceeded to make a kind of encampment on
the poop, and the few mattresses that were rescued uninjured have been
given up for the use of the two ladies.

This is an atom: 
Such of the crew as had saved
their hammocks have been told to place them under the forecastle where
they would have to stow themselves as best they could, their ordinary
quarters being absolutely uninhabitable.

This is an atom: 
Fortunately, although the store-room has been considerably exposed
to the heat, its contents are not very seriously damaged, and all
the barrels of water and the greater part of the provisions are quite
intact.

This is an atom: 
The stack of spare sails, which had been packed away in front,
is also free from injury.

This is an atom: 
The wind has dropped considerably since the
early morning, and the swell in the sea is far less heavy.

This is an atom: 
On the whole
our spirits are reviving, and we begin to think we may yet find a way
out of our troubles.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur, his son, and I, have just had a long conversation about
the ship's officers.

This is an atom: 
We consider their conduct, under the late trying
circumstances, to have been most exemplary, and their courage, energy,
and endurance to have been beyond all praise.

This is an atom: 
Lieutenant Walter,
the boatswain, and Dowlas the carpenter have all alike distinguished
themselves, and made us feel that they are men to be relied on.

This is an atom: 
As for
Curtis, words can scarcely be found to express our admiration of his
character; he is the same as he has ever been, the very life of his
crew, cheering them on by word or gesture; finding an expedient for
every difficulty, and always foremost in every action.

This is an atom: 
The tide turned at seven this morning, and by eleven all the rocks were
submerged, none of them being visible except the cluster of those which
formed the rim of a small and almost circular basin from 250 to 300 feet
in diameter, in the north angle of which the ship is lying.

This is an atom: 
As the tide
rose the white breakers disappeared, and the sea, fortunately for
the "Chancellor," was pretty calm; otherwise the dashing of the waves
against her sides, as she lies motionless, might have been attended by
serious consequences.

This is an atom: 
As might be supposed, the height of the water in the hold increased
with the tide from five feet to nine; but this was rather a matter for
congratulation, inasmuch as it sufficed to inundate another layer of
cotton.

This is an atom: 
At half-past eleven the sun, which had been behind the clouds since
ten o'clock, broke forth brightly.

This is an atom: 
The captain, who had already in the
morning been able to calculate an horary angle, now prepared to take
the meridian altitude, and succeeded at midday in making his observation
most satisfactorily.

This is an atom: 
After retiring for a short time to calculate the
result; he returned to the poop and announced that we are in lat; 18deg.

This is an atom: 
W., but that the reef on which we are
aground is not marked upon the charts.

This is an atom: 
The only explanation that can be
given for the omission is that the islet must be of recent formation,
and has been caused by some subterranean volcanic disturbance.

This is an atom: 
But
whatever may be the solution of the mystery, here we are 800 miles from
land; for such, on consulting the map, we find to be the actual distance
to the coast of Guiana, which is the nearest shore.

This is an atom: 
Such is the position
to which we have been brought, in the first place, by Huntly's senseless
obstinacy, and, secondly, by the furious north-west gale.

This is an atom: 
Yet, after all, the captain's communication does not dishearten us.

This is an atom: 
As
I said before, our spirits are reviving.

This is an atom: 
We have escaped the peril of
fire; the fear of explosion is past and gone; and oblivious of the fact
that the ship with a hold full of water is only too likely to founder
when she puts out to sea, we feel a confidence in the future that
forbids us to despond.

This is an atom: 
Meanwhile Curtis prepares to do all that common sense demands.

This is an atom: 
He
proposes, when the fire is quite extinguished, to throw overboard the
whole, or the greater portion of the cargo, including of course, the
picrate; he will next plug up the leak, and then, with a lightened
ship, he will take advantage of the first high tide to quit the reef as
speedily as possible.

This is an atom: 
OCTOBER 30th.--Once again I talked to M. Letourneur about our situation,
and endeavoured to animate him with the hope that we should not be
detained for long in our present predicament; but he could not be
brought to take a very sanguine view of our prospects.

This is an atom: 
"But surely," I protested, "it will not be difficult to throw overboard
a few hundred bales of cotton; two or three days at most will suffice
for that.

This is an atom: 
"

"Likely enough," he replied, "when the business is once begun; but you
must remember, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon, that the very heart of the cargo is still
smouldering, and that it will still be several days before any one will
be able to venture into the hold.

This is an atom: 
Then the leak, too, that has to be
caulked; and, unless it is stopped up very effectually, we shall be
only doomed most certainly to perish at sea.

This is an atom: 
Don't, then, be deceiving
yourself; it must be three weeks at least before you can expect to put
out to sea.

This is an atom: 
I can only hope meanwhile that the weather will continue
propitious; it wouldn't take many storms to knock the 'Chancellor,'
shattered as she is, completely into pieces.

This is an atom: 
"

Here, then, was the suggestion of a new danger to which we were to be
exposed; the fire might be extinguished, the water might be got rid of
by the pumps, but, after all, we must be at the mercy of the wind and
waves; and, although the rocky island might afford a temporary refuge
from the tempest, what was to become of passengers and crew if the
vessel should be reduced to a total wreck?

This is an atom: 
I made no remonstrance,
however, to this view of our case, but merely asked M. Letourneur if he
had confidence in Robert Curtis?

This is an atom: 
"Perfect confidence," he answered; "and I acknowledge it most
gratefully, as a providential circumstance, that Captain Huntly had
given him the command in time.

This is an atom: 
Whatever man can do I know that Curtis
will not leave undone to extricate us from our dilemma.

This is an atom: 
"

Prompted by this conversation with M. Letourneur I took the first
opportunity of trying to ascertain from Curtis himself, how long he
reckoned we should be obliged to remain upon the reef; but he merely
replied, that it must depend upon circumstances, and that he hoped the
weather would continue favourable.

This is an atom: 
Fortunately the barometer is rising
steadily, and there is every sign of a prolonged calm.

This is an atom: 
Meantime Curtis is taking active measures for totally extinguishing the
fire.

This is an atom: 
He is at no great pains to spare the cargo, and as the bales that
lie just above the level of the water are still a-light he has resorted
to the expedient of thoroughly saturating the upper layers of the
cotton, in order that the combustion may be stifled between the moisture
descending from above and that ascending from below.

This is an atom: 
This scheme has
brought the pumps once more into requisition.

This is an atom: 
At present the crew are
adequate to the task of working them, but I and some of our fellow
passengers are ready to offer our assistance whenever it shall be
necessary.

This is an atom: 
With no immediate demand upon our labour, we are thrown upon our own
resources for passing our time.

This is an atom: 
Letourneur, Andre and myself, have
frequent conversations; I also devote an hour or two to my diary.

This is an atom: 
Falsten holds little communication with any of us, but remains absorbed
in his calculations, and amuses himself by tracing mechanical diagrams
with ground-plan, section, elevation, all complete.

This is an atom: 
It would be a happy
inspiration if he could invent some mighty engine that could set us all
afloat again.

This is an atom: 
Kear, too, hold themselves aloof from
their fellow passengers, and we are not sorry to be relieved from the
necessity of listening to their incessant grumbling; unfortunately,
however, they carry off Miss Herbey with them, so that we enjoy little
or nothing of the young lady's society.

This is an atom: 
As for Silas Huntly, he has
become a complete nonentity; he exists, it is true, but merely, it would
seem, to vegetate.

This is an atom: 
Hobart, the steward, an obsequious, sly sort of fellow, goes through his
routine of duties just as though the vessel were pursuing her ordinary
course; and, as usual, is continually falling out with Jynxstrop, the
cook, an impudent, ill-favoured negro, who interferes with the other
sailors in a manner which, I think, ought not to be allowed.

This is an atom: 
Since it appears likely that we shall have abundance of time on our
hands, I have proposed to M. Letourneur and his son that we shall
together explore the reef on which we are stranded.

This is an atom: 
It is not very
probable that we shall be able to discover much about the origin of this
strange accumulation of rock, yet the attempt will at least occupy us
for some hours, and will relieve us from the monotony of our confinement
on board.

This is an atom: 
Besides, as the reef is not marked in any of the maps, I could
not but believe that it would be rendering a service to hydrography if
we were to take an accurate plan of the rocks, of which Curtis could
afterwards verify the true position by a second observation made with a
closer precision than the one he has already taken.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur agrees to my proposal, Curtis has promised to let us have
the boat and some sounding-lines, and to allow one of the sailors to
accompany us; so to-morrow morning, we hope to make our little voyage of
investigation.

This is an atom: 
OCTOBER 31st to NOVEMBER 5th.--Our first proceeding on the morning of
the 31st was to make the proposed tour of the reef, which is about a
quarter of a mile long.

This is an atom: 
With the aid of our sounding-lines we found that
the water was deep, right up to the very rocks, and that no shelving
shores prevented us coasting along them.

This is an atom: 
There was not a shadow of doubt
as to the rock being of purely volcanic origin, upheaved by some mighty
subterranean convulsion.

This is an atom: 
It is formed of blocks of basalt, arranged
in perfect order, of which the regular prisms give the whole mass the
effect of being one gigantic crystal; and the remarkable transparency
of the sea enabled us plainly to observe the curious shafts of the
prismatic columns that support the marvelous substructure.

This is an atom: 
"This is indeed a singular island," said M. Letourneur; "evidently it is
of quite a recent origin.

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes, father," said Andre, "and I should think it has been caused by
a phenomenon similar to those which produced the Julia Island, off
the coast of Sicily, or the group of the Santorini, in the Grecian
Archipelago.

This is an atom: 
One could almost fancy that it had been created expressly
for the 'Chancellor' to stand upon.

This is an atom: 
"

"It is very certain," I observed, "that some upheaving has lately taken
place.

This is an atom: 
This is by no means an unfrequented part of the Atlantic, so that
it is not at all likely that it could have escaped the notice of sailors
if it had been always in existence; yet it is not marked even in the
most modern charts.

This is an atom: 
We must try and explore it thoroughly and give
future navigators the benefit of our observations.

This is an atom: 
"

"But, perhaps, it will disappear as it came," said Andre.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon, that these volcanic islands sometimes have
a very transitory existence.

This is an atom: 
Not impossibly, by the time it gets marked
upon the maps it may no longer be here.

This is an atom: 
"

"Never mind, my boy," answered his father, "it is better to give warning
of a danger that does not exist than overlook one that does.

This is an atom: 
I daresay
the sailors will not grumble much, if they don't find a reef where we
have marked one.

This is an atom: 
"

"No, I daresay not, father," said Andre "and after all this island is
very likely as firm as a continent.

This is an atom: 
However, if it is to disappear, I
expect Captain Curtis would be glad to see it take its departure as soon
as possible after he has finished his repairs; it would save him a world
of trouble in getting his ship afloat.

This is an atom: 
"

"Why, what a fellow you are Andre!

This is an atom: 
" I said, laughing, "I believe you
would like to rule Nature with a magic wand; first of all, you would
call up a reef from the depth of the ocean to give the 'Chancellor' time
to extinguish her flames, and then you would make it disappear just that
the ship might be free again.

This is an atom: 
"

Andre smiled; then, in a more serious tone, he expressed his gratitude
for the timely help that had been vouchsafed us in our hour of need.

This is an atom: 
The more we examined the rocks that formed the base of the little
island, the more we became convinced that its formation was quite
recent, Not a mollusk, not a tuft of seaweed was found clinging to the
sides of the rocks; not a germ had the wind carried to its surface, not
a bird had taken refuge amidst the crags upon its summits.

This is an atom: 
To a lover of
natural history, the spot did not yield a single point of interest; the
geologist alone would find subject of study in the basaltic mass.

This is an atom: 
When we reached the southern point of the island I proposed that we
should disembark.

This is an atom: 
My companions readily assented, young Letourneur
jocosely observing that if the little island was destined to vanish,
it was quite right that it should first be visited by human beings.

This is an atom: 
The
boat was accordingly brought alongside, and we set, foot upon the
reef, and began to ascend the gradual slope that leads to its highest
elevation.

This is an atom: 
The walking was not very rough, and as Andre could get along tolerably
well without the assistance of an arm, he led the way, his father and I
following close behind.

This is an atom: 
A quarter of an hour sufficed to bring us to the
loftiest point in the islet, when we seated ourselves on the basaltic
prism that crowned its summit.

This is an atom: 
Andre took a sketch-book from his pocket, and proceeded to make a
drawing of the reef.

This is an atom: 
Scarcely had he completed the outline when his
father exclaimed,--

"Why, Andre, you have drawn a ham!

This is an atom: 
"

"Something uncommonly like it, I confess," replied Andre.

This is an atom: 
"I think we
had better ask Captain Curtis to let us call our island Ham Rock.

This is an atom: 
"

"Good," said I; "though sailors will need to keep it at a respectful
distance, for they will scarcely find that their teeth are strong enough
to tackle with it.

This is an atom: 
"

M. Letourneur was quite correct; the outline of the reef as it stood
clearly defined against the deep green water resembled nothing so much,
as a fine York ham, of which the little creek, where the "Chancellor"
had been stranded, corresponded to the hollow place above the knuckle.

This is an atom: 
The tide at this time was low, and the ship now lay heeled over very
much to the starboard side, the few points of rock that emerged in the
extreme south of the reef plainly marking the narrow passage through
which she had been forced before she finally ran aground.

This is an atom: 
As soon as Andre had finished his sketch we descended by a slope as
gradual as that by which we had come up, and made our way towards the
west.

This is an atom: 
We had not gone very far when a beautiful grotto, perfect as an
architectural structure, arrested our attention, M. Letourneur and Andre
who have visited the Hebrides, pronounced it to be a Fingal's cave
in miniature; a Gothic chapel that might form a fit vestibule for the
cathedral cave of Staffa.

This is an atom: 
The basaltic rocks had cooled down into the
same regular concentric prisms; there was the same dark canopied
roof with its interstices filled up with its yellow lutings; the same
precision of outline in the prismatic angles, sharp as though chiselled
by a sculptor's hand; the same sonorous vibration of the air across the
basaltic rocks, of which the Gaelic poets have feigned that the harps of
the Fingal minstrelsy were made.

This is an atom: 
But whereas at Staffa the floor of the
cave is always covered with a sheet of water, here the grotto was beyond
the reach of all but the highest waves, whilst the prismatic shafts
themselves formed quite a solid pavement.

This is an atom: 
After remaining nearly an hour in our newly-discovered grotto we
returned to the "Chancellor," and communicated the result of our
explorations to Curtis, who entered the island upon his chart by the
name that Andre Letourneur had proposed.

This is an atom: 
Since its discovery we have not permitted a day to pass without spending
some time in our Ham Rock grotto.

This is an atom: 
Curtis has taken an opportunity of
visiting it, but he is too preoccupied with other matters to have much
interest to spare for the wonders of nature.

This is an atom: 
Falsten, too, came once and
examined the character of the rocks, knocking and chipping them about
with all the mercilessness of a geologist.

This is an atom: 
Kear would not trouble
himself to leave the ship; and although I asked his wife to join us in
one of our excursions she declined, upon the plea that the fatigue, as
well as the inconvenience of embarking in the boat, would be more than
she could bear.

This is an atom: 
Miss Herbey, only too thankful to escape even for an hour from her
capricious mistress, eagerly accepted M. Letourneur's invitation to pay
a visit to the reef but to her great disappointment Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Kear at first
refused point-blank to allow her to leave the ship.

This is an atom: 
I felt intensely
annoyed, and resolved to intercede in Miss Herbey's favour; and as I
had already rendered that self-indulgent lady sundry services which she
thought she might probably be glad again to accept, I gained my point,
and Miss Herbey has several times been permitted to accompany us across
the rocks, where the young girl's delight at her freedom has been a
pleasure to behold.

This is an atom: 
Sometimes we fish along the shore, and, then enjoy a luncheon in the
grotto, whilst the basalt columns vibrate like harps to the breeze.

This is an atom: 
This arid reef, little as it is, compared with the cramped limits of
the "Chancellor's" deck is like some vast domain; soon there will be
scarcely a stone with which we are not familiar, scarcely a portion of
its surface which we have not merrily trodden, and I am sure that when
the hour of departure arrives we shall leave it with regret.

This is an atom: 
In the course of conversation, Andre Letourneur one day happened to say
that he believed the island of Staffa belonged to the Macdonald family,
who let it for the small sum of 12 pounds a year.

This is an atom: 
"I suppose then," said Miss Herbey, "that we should hardly get more than
half-a-crown a year for our pet little island.

This is an atom: 
"

"I don't think you would get a penny for it, Miss Herbey; but are you
thinking of taking a lease?

This is an atom: 
"Not at present," she said; then added, with a half-suppressed sigh,
"and yet it is a place where I have seemed to know what it is to be
really happy.

This is an atom: 
"

Andre murmured some expression of assent, and we all felt that there was
something touching in the words of the orphaned, friendless girl who had
found her long-lost sense of happiness on a lonely rock in the Atlantic.

This is an atom: 
NOVEMBER 6th to NOVEMBER 15th.--For the first five days after the
"Chancellor" had run aground, there was a dense black smoke continually
rising from the hold; but it gradually diminished until the 6th of
November, when we might consider that the fire was extinguished.

This is an atom: 
Curtis,
nevertheless, deemed it prudent to persevere in working the pumps, which
he did until the entire hull of the ship, right up to the deck, had been
completely inundated.

This is an atom: 
The rapidity, however, with which the water, at every retreat of the
tide, drained off to the level of the sea, was an indication that the
leak must be of considerable magnitude; and such, on investigation,
proved to be the case.

This is an atom: 
One of the sailors, named Flaypole, dived one
day at low water to examine the extent of the damage, and found that the
hole was not much less than four feet square, and was situated thirty
feet fore of the helm, and two feet above the rider of the keel; three
planks had been stoved in by a sharp point of rock, and it was only a
wonder that the violence with which the heavily-laden vessel had been
thrown ashore did not result in the smashing in of many parts besides.

This is an atom: 
As it would be a couple of days or more before the hold would be in a
condition for the bales of cotton to be removed for the carpenter to
examine the damage from the interior of the ship, Curtis employed the
interval in having the broken mizzen-mast repaired.

This is an atom: 
Dowlas the carpenter,
with considerable skill, contrived to mortice it into its former stump,
and made the junction thoroughly secure by strong iron-belts and bolts.

This is an atom: 
The shrouds, the stays and backstays, were then carefully refitted,
some of the sails were changed, and the whole of the running rigging was
renewed.

This is an atom: 
Injury, to some extent, had been done to the poop and to the
crew's lockers, in the front; but time and labour were all that were
wanted to make them good; and with such a will, did every one set to
work that it was not long before all the cabins were again available for
use.

This is an atom: 
Pulleys and tackling were
put over the hatches, and passengers and crew together proceeded to haul
up the heavy bales which had been deluged so frequently by water that
the cotton was all but spoiled.

This is an atom: 
One by one the sodden bales were placed
in the boat to be transported to the reef.

This is an atom: 
After the first layer of
cotton had been removed it became necessary to drain off part of the
water that filled the hold.

This is an atom: 
For this purpose the leak in the side had
somehow or other to be stopped, and this was an operation which was
cleverly accomplished by Dowlas and Flaypole, who contrived to dive at
low tide and nail a sheet of copper over the entire hole.

This is an atom: 
This, however,
of itself would have been utterly inadequate to sustain the pressure
that would arise from the action of the pumps; so Curtis ordered that a
number of the bales should be piled up inside against the broken planks.

This is an atom: 
The scheme succeeded very well, and as the water got lower and lower in
the hold the men were enabled to resume their task of unlading.

This is an atom: 
Curtis thinks it quite probable that the leaks may be mended from the
interior.

This is an atom: 
By far the best way of repairing the damage would be to careen
the ship, and to shift the planking, but the appliances are wanting for
such an undertaking; moreover, any bad weather which might occur while
the ship was on her flank would only too certainly be fatal to her
altogether.

This is an atom: 
But the captain has very little doubt that by some device or
other he shall manage to patch up the hole in such a way as will insure
our reaching land in safety.

This is an atom: 
After two days' toil the water was entirely reduced and without further
difficulty the unlading was completed.

This is an atom: 
All of us, including even Andre
Letourneur, have been taking our turn at the pumps, for the work is so
extremely fatiguing that the crew require some occasional respite; arms
and back soon become strained and weary with the incessant swing of
the handles, and I can well understand the dislike which sailors always
express to the labour.

This is an atom: 
One thing there is which is much in our favour; the ship lies on a firm
and solid bottom, and we have the satisfaction of knowing that we
are not contending with a flood that encroaches faster than it can be
resisted.

This is an atom: 
Heaven grant that we may not be called to make like efforts,
and to make them hopelessly, for a foundering ship!

This is an atom: 
NOVEMBER 15th to 20th.--The examination of the hold has at last been
made.

This is an atom: 
Amongst the first things that were found was the case of picrate,
perfectly intact; having neither been injured by the water, nor of
course reached by the flames.

This is an atom: 
Why it was not at once pitched into the
sea I cannot say; but it was merely conveyed to the extremity of the
island, and there it remains.

This is an atom: 
While they were below, Curtis and Dowlas made themselves acquainted with
the full extent of the mischief that had been done by the conflagration.

This is an atom: 
They found that the deck and the cross-beams that supported it had been
much less injured than they expected, and the thick, heavy planks had
only been scorched very superficially.

This is an atom: 
But the action of the fire on
the flanks of the ship had been of a much more serious character; a long
portion of the inside boarding had been burnt away, and the very ribs
of the vessel were considerably damaged; the oakum caulkings had all
started away from the butt-ends and seams; so much so that it was
little short of a miracle that the whole ship had not long since gaped
completely open.

This is an atom: 
Curtis lost no time in assembling passengers and crew, and announcing to
them the facts of the case.

This is an atom: 
"My friends," he said, "I am here to tell you that the 'Chancellor' has
sustained far greater injuries than we suspected, and that her hull is
very seriously damaged.

This is an atom: 
If we had been stranded anywhere else than on a
barren reef, that may at any time be overwhelmed by a tempestuous sea
I should not have hesitated to take the ship to pieces, and construct a
smaller vessel that might have carried us safely to land; but I dare not
run the risk of remaining here.

This is an atom: 
We are now 800 miles from the coast of
Paramaribo, the nearest portion of Dutch Guiana, and in ten or twelve
days, if the weather should be favourable, I believe we could reach the
shore.

This is an atom: 
What I now propose to do is to stop the leak by the best means we
can command, and make at once for the nearest port.

This is an atom: 
"

As no better plan seemed to suggest itself, Curtis's proposal was
unanimously accepted Dowlas and his assistants immediately set to work
to repair the charred frame-work of the ribs, and to stop the leak; they
took care thoroughly to caulk from the outside all the seams that were
above low water mark; lower than that they were unable to work, and
had to content themselves with such repairs as they could effect in the
interior.

This is an atom: 
But after all the pains there is no doubt the "Chancellor" is
not fit for a long voyage, and would be condemned as unseaworthy at any
port at which we might put in.

This is an atom: 
To-day, the 20th, Curtis having done all that human power could do to
repair his ship, determined to put her to sea.

This is an atom: 
Ever since the "Chancellor" had been relieved of her cargo, and of the
water in her hold, she had been able to float in the little natural
basin into which she had been driven.

This is an atom: 
The basin was enclosed on either
hand by rocks that remained uncovered even at high water, but was
sufficiently wide to allow the vessel to turn quite round at its
broadest part, and by means of hawsers fastened on the reef to be
brought with her bows towards the south; while, to prevent her being
carried back on to the reef, she has been anchored fore and aft.

This is an atom: 
To all appearance, then, it seemed as though it would be an easy matter
to put the "Chancellor" to sea; if the wind were favourable the sails
would be hoisted, if otherwise, she would have to be towed through the
narrow passage.

This is an atom: 
But unlooked-for difficulties had yet
to be surmounted.

This is an atom: 
The mouth of the passage is guarded by a kind of ridge of basalt, which
at high tide we knew was barely covered with sufficient water to float
the "Chancellor," even when entirely unfreighted.

This is an atom: 
To be sure she had
been carried over the obstacle once before, but then, as I have already
said, she had been caught up by an enormous wave, and might have been
said to be LIFTED over the barrier into her present position.

This is an atom: 
Besides,
on that ever-memorable night, there had not only been the ordinary
spring-tide, but an equinoctial tide, such a one as could not be
expected to occur again for many months.

This is an atom: 
Waiting was out of the
question; so Curtis determined to run the risk, and to take advantage of
the spring-tide, which would occur to-day, to make an attempt to get the
ship, lightened as she was, over the bar; after which, he might ballast
her sufficiently to sail.

This is an atom: 
The wind was blowing from the north-west, and consequently right in the
direction of the passage.

This is an atom: 
The captain, however, after a consultation,
preferred to tow the ship over the ridge, as he considered it was
scarcely safe to allow a vessel of doubtful stability at full sail to
charge an obstacle that would probably bring her to a dead lock.

This is an atom: 
Before
the operation was commenced, Curtis took the precaution of having
an anchor ready in the stern, for, in the event of the attempt being
unsuccessful, it would be necessary to bring the ship back to her
present moorings.

This is an atom: 
Two more anchors were next carried outside the
passage, which was not more than two hundred feet in length.

This is an atom: 
The
chains were attached to the windlass, the sailors worked away at the
handspikes, and at four o'clock in the afternoon the "Chancellor" was in
motion.

This is an atom: 
High tide would be at twenty minutes past four, and at ten minutes
before that time the ship had been hauled as far as her sea-range would
allow; her keel grazed the ridge, and her progress was arrested.

This is an atom: 
When
the lowest part of her stern, however, just cleared the obstruction,
Curtis deemed that there was no longer any reason why the mechanical
action of the wind should not be brought to bear and contribute its
assistance.

This is an atom: 
Without delay, all sails were unfurled and trimmed to the
wind.

This is an atom: 
The tide was exactly at its height, passengers and crew together
were at the windlass, M. Letourneur, Andre, Falsten, and myself being
at the starboard bar.

This is an atom: 
Curtis stood upon the poop, giving his chief
attention to the sails; the lieutenant was on the forecastle; the
boatswain by the helm.

This is an atom: 
The sea seemed propitiously calm and, as it
swelled gently to and fro, lifted the ship several times.

This is an atom: 
"

Round went the windlass; click, click, clanked the chains as link by
link they were forced through the hawse-holes.

This is an atom: 
The breeze freshened, and the masts gave to the pressure of the sails,
but round and round we went, keeping time in regular monotony to the
sing-song tune hummed by one of the sailors.

This is an atom: 
We had gained about twenty feet, and were redoubling our efforts when
the ship grounded again.

This is an atom: 
And now no effort would avail; all was in vain; the tide began to turn;
and the "Chancellor" would not advance an inch.

This is an atom: 
Was there time to go
back?

This is an atom: 
She would inevitably go to pieces if left balanced upon the ridge.

This is an atom: 
In an instant the captain has ordered the sails to be furled, and the
anchor dropped from the stern.

This is an atom: 
The "Chancellor" tacks to stern, and glides back into the basin, which
is once more her prison.

This is an atom: 
"Well, captain," says the boatswain, "what's to be done now?

This is an atom: 
"

"I don't know" said Curtis, "but we shall get across somehow.

This is an atom: 
NOVEMBER 21st to 24th.--There was assuredly no time to be lost before we
ought to leave Ham Rock reef.

This is an atom: 
The barometer had been falling ever since
the morning, the sea was getting rougher, and there was every symptom
that the weather, hitherto so favourable, was on the point of breaking;
and in the event of a gale the "Chancellor" must inevitably be dashed to
pieces on the rocks.

This is an atom: 
In the evening, when the tide was quite low, and the rocks uncovered,
Curtis, the boatswain, and Dowlas went to examine the ridge which had
proved so serious an obstruction, Falsten and I accompanied them.

This is an atom: 
We
came to the conclusion that the only way of effecting a passage was by
cutting away the rocks with pikes over a surface measuring ten feet by
six.

This is an atom: 
An extra depth of nine or ten inches would give a sufficient gauge,
and the channel might be accurately marked out by buoys; in this way it
was conjectured the ship might be got over the ridge and so reach the
deep water beyond.

This is an atom: 
"But this basalt is as hard as granite," said the boatswain; "besides,
we can only get at it at low water, and consequently could only work at
it for two hours out of the twenty-four.

This is an atom: 
"

"All the more reason why we should begin at once, boatswain," said
Curtis.

This is an atom: 
"But if it is to take us a month, captain, perhaps by that time the ship
may be knocked to atoms.

This is an atom: 
Couldn't we manage to blow up the rock?

This is an atom: 
we have
got some powder on board.

This is an atom: 
"

"Not enough for that;" said the boatswain.

This is an atom: 
"You have something better than powder," said Falsten.

This is an atom: 
"What's that?

This is an atom: 
And so the explosive substance with which poor Ruby had so grievously
imperilled the vessel was now to serve her in good stead, and I now saw
what a lucky thing it was that the case had been deposited safely on the
reef, instead of being thrown into the sea.

This is an atom: 
Picric acid is a crystalline bitter product extracted from coal-tar, and
forming, in combination with potash, a yellow salt known as picrate of
potash.

This is an atom: 
The explosive power of this substance is inferior to that
of gun-cotton or of dynamite, but far greater than that of ordinary
gunpowder; one grain of picric powder producing an effect equal to that
of thirteen grains of common powder.

This is an atom: 
Picrate is easily ignited by
any sharp or violent shock, and some gun-priming which we had in our
possession would answer the purpose of setting it alight.

This is an atom: 
The sailors went off at once for their pikes, and Dowlas and his
assistants, under the direction of Falsten, who, as an engineer,
understood such matters, proceeded to hollow out a mine wherein to
deposit the powder.

This is an atom: 
At first we hoped that everything would be ready for
the blasting to take place on the following morning, but when daylight
appeared we found that the men, although they had laboured with a will,
had only been able to work for an hour at low water and that four tides
must ebb before the mine had been sunk to the required depth.

This is an atom: 
Not until eight o'clock on the morning of the 23rd was the work
complete.

This is an atom: 
The hole was bored obliquely in the rock, and was large enough
to contain about ten pounds of explosive matter.

This is an atom: 
Just as the picrate was
being introduced into the aperture, Falsten interposed:--

"Stop," he said, "I think it will be best to mix the picrate with common
powder, as that will allow us to fire the mine with a match instead of
the gun-priming which would be necessary to produce a shock.

This is an atom: 
Besides,
it is an understood thing that the addition of gunpowder renders picrate
far more effective in blasting such rocks as this, as then the violence
of the picrate prepares the way for the powder which, slower in its
action, will complete the disseverment of the basalt.

This is an atom: 
"

Falsten is not a great talker, but what he does say is always very
much to the point.

This is an atom: 
His good advice was immediately followed; the two
substances were mixed together, and after a match had been introduced
the compound was rammed closely into the hole.

This is an atom: 
Notwithstanding that the "Chancellor" was at a distance from the rocks
that insured her from any danger of being injured by the explosion, it
was thought advisable that the passengers and crew should take refuge in
the grotto at the extremity of the reef, and even Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kear, in spite of
his many objections, was forced to leave the ship.

This is an atom: 
Falsten, as soon as
he had set fire to the match, joined us in our retreat.

This is an atom: 
The train was to burn for ten minutes, and at the end of that time the
explosion took place; the report, on account of the depth of the
mine, being muffled, and much less noisy than we had expected.

This is an atom: 
But the
operation had been perfectly successful.

This is an atom: 
Before we reached the ridge we
could see that the basalt had been literally reduced to powder, and that
a little channel, already being filled by the rising tide, had been
cut right through the obstacle.

This is an atom: 
A loud hurrah rang through the air; our
prison-doors were opened, and we were prisoners no more!

This is an atom: 
At high tide the "Chancellor" weighed anchor and floated out into the
open sea, but she was not in a condition to sail until she had been
ballasted; and for the next twenty-four hours the crew were busily
employed in taking up blocks of stone, and such of the bales of cotton
as had sustained the least amount of injury.

This is an atom: 
In the course of the day, M. Letourneur, Andre, Miss Herbey, and I took
a farewell walk round the reef, and Andre with artistic skill, carved on
the wall of the grotto the word "Chancellor,"--the designation Ham Rock,
which we had given to the reef,--and the date of our running aground.

This is an atom: 
Then we bade adieu to the scene of our three week's sojourn, where we
had passed days that to some at least of our party will be reckoned as
far from being the least happy of their lives.

This is an atom: 
At high tide this morning, the 24th, with low, top, and gallant sails
all set, the "Chancellor" started on her onward way, and two hours later
the last peak of Ham Rock had vanished below the horizon.

This is an atom: 
NOVEMBER 24th to DECEMBER 1st.--Here we were then once more at sea, and
although on board a ship of which the stability was very questionable,
we had hopes, if the wind continued favourable, of reaching the coast of
Guiana in the course of a few days.

This is an atom: 
Our way was south-west and consequently with the wind, and although
Curtis would not crowd on all sail lest the extra speed should have a
tendency to spring the leak afresh, the "Chancellor" made a progress
that was quite satisfactory.

This is an atom: 
Life on board began to fall back into its
former routine; the feeling of insecurity and the consciousness that
we were merely retracing our path doing much, however, to destroy the
animated intercourse that would otherwise go on between passenger and
passenger.

This is an atom: 
The first few days passed without any incident worth recording, then
on the 29th, the wind shifted to the north, and it became necessary to
brace the yards, trim the sails, and take a starboard tack.

This is an atom: 
This made
the ship lurch very much on one side, and as Curtis felt that she was
labouring far too heavily, he clued up the top-gallants, prudently
reckoning that, under the circumstances, caution was far more important
than speed.

This is an atom: 
The breeze freshened considerably,
and, unfortunately for us, hailed from the north-west.

This is an atom: 
Although we
carried no top-sails at all, the ship seemed to heel over more than
ever.

This is an atom: 
Most of the passengers had retired to their cabins, but all the
crew remained on deck, whilst Curtis never quitted his post upon the
poop.

This is an atom: 
Towards two o'clock in the morning I was myself preparing to go to my
cabin, when Burke, one of the sailors who had been down into the hold,
came on deck with the ominous cry,--

"Two feet of water below.

This is an atom: 
"

In an instant Curtis and the boatswain had descended the ladder.

This is an atom: 
The
startling news was only too true; the sea-water was entering the hold,
but whether the leak had sprung afresh, or whether the caulking in some
of the seams was insufficient, it was then impossible to determine; all
that could be done was to let the ship go with the wind and wait for
day.

This is an atom: 
" was the report,
I glanced at Curtis, his lips were white, but he had not lost his
self-possession.

This is an atom: 
He quietly informed such of the passengers as were
already on deck of the new danger that threatened us; it was better that
they should know the worst, and the fact could not be long concealed.

This is an atom: 
I
told M. Letourneur that I could not help hoping that there might yet be
time to reach the land before the last crisis came.

This is an atom: 
Falsten was about to
give vent to an expression of despair, but he was soon silenced by Miss
Herbey asserting her confidence that all would yet be well.

This is an atom: 
Curtis at once divided the crew into two sets, and made them work
incessantly, turn and turn about at the pumps.

This is an atom: 
The men applied
themselves to their task with resignation rather than with ardour; the
labour was hard and scarcely repaid them; the pumps were constantly
getting out of order, the valves being choked up by the ashes and bits
of cotton that were floating about in the hold, while every moment that
was spent in cleaning or repairing them was so much time lost.

This is an atom: 
Slowly, but surely, the water continued to rise, and on the following
morning the soundings gave five feet for its depth, I noticed that
Curtis's brow contracted each time that the boatswain or the lieutenant
brought him their report.

This is an atom: 
There was no doubt it was only a question of
time, and not for an instant must the efforts for keeping down the level
be relaxed.

This is an atom: 
Already the ship had sunk a foot lower in the water, and as
her weight increased she no longer rose buoyantly with the waves, but
pitched and rolled considerably.

This is an atom: 
All yesterday, and last night, the pumping continued; but still the
sea gained upon us.

This is an atom: 
The crew are weary and discouraged, but the second
officer and the boatswain set them a fine example of endurance, and the
passengers have now begun to take their turn at the pumps.

This is an atom: 
But all are conscious of toiling almost against hope; we are no longer
secured firmly to the solid soil of the Ham Rock reef, but we are
floating over an abyss which daily, nay hourly, threatens to swallow us
into its depths.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 2nd and 3rd.--For four hours we have succeeded in keeping the
water in the hold to one level; now, however, it is very evident that
the time cannot be far distant when the pumps will be quite unequal to
their task.

This is an atom: 
Yesterday Curtis, who does not allow himself a minute's rest, made a
personal inspection of the hold.

This is an atom: 
After dislodging some of the bales of cotton we could
hear a splashing, or rather gurgling sound; but whether the water
was entering at the original aperture, or whether it found its way in
through a general dislocation of the seams, we were unable to discover.

This is an atom: 
But whichever might be the case, Curtis determined to try a plan which,
by cutting off communication between the interior and exterior of the
vessel, might, if only for a few hours, render her hull more watertight.

This is an atom: 
For this purpose he had some strong, well-tarred sails drawn upwards by
ropes from below the keel, as high as the previous leaking-place, and
then fastened closely and securely to the side of the hull.

This is an atom: 
The
scheme was dubious, and the operation difficult, but for a time it
was effectual, and at the close of the day the level of the water
had actually been reduced by several inches.

This is an atom: 
The diminution was small
enough, but the consciousness that more water was escaping through
the scupper-holes than was finding its way into the hold gave us fresh
courage to persevere with our work.

This is an atom: 
The night was dark, but the captain carried all the sail he could,
eager to take every possible advantage of the wind, which was freshening
considerably.

This is an atom: 
If he could have sighted a ship he would have made signals
of distress, and would not have hesitated to transfer the passengers,
and even have allowed the crew to follow, if they were ready to forsake
him; for himself his mind was made up, he should remain on board the
"Chancellor" until she foundered beneath his feet.

This is an atom: 
No sail, however,
hove in sight; consequently escape by such means was out of our power.

This is an atom: 
During the night the canvas covering yielded to the pressure of the
waves, and this morning, after taking the sounding, the boatswain could
not suppress an oath when he announced "Six feet of water in the hold!

This is an atom: 
"

The ship, then, was filling once again, and already had sunk
considerably below her previous water-line.

This is an atom: 
With aching arms and
bleeding hands we worked harder than ever at the pumps, and Curtis makes
those who are not pumping form a line and pass buckets, with all the
speed they can, from hand to hand.

This is an atom: 
At half-past eight more water is reported in the hold,
and some of the sailors, overcome by despair, refuse to work one minute
longer.

This is an atom: 
The first to abandon his post was Owen, a man whom I have mentioned
before, as exhibiting something of a mutinous spirit, He is about forty
years of age, and altogether unprepossessing in appearance; his face
is bare, with the exception of a reddish beard, which terminates in a
point; his forehead is furrowed with sinister-looking wrinkles, his lips
curl inwards, and his ears protrude, whilst his bleared and bloodshot
eyes are encircled with thick red rings.

This is an atom: 
Amongst the five or six other men who had struck work, I noticed
Jynxstrop the cook, who evidently shared all Owen's ill feelings.

This is an atom: 
Twice did Curtis order the men back to the pumps, and twice did Owen,
acting as spokesman for the rest, refuse; and when Curtis made a step
forward as though to approach him, he said savagely,--

"I advise you not to touch me," and walked away to the forecastle.

This is an atom: 
Curtis descended to his cabin, and almost immediately returned with a
loaded revolver in his hand.

This is an atom: 
For a moment Owen surveyed the captain with a frown of defiance; but
at a sign from Jynxstrop he seemed to recollect himself; and, with the
remainder of the men, he returned to his work.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 4th.--The first attempt at mutiny being thus happily
suppressed, it is to be hoped that Curtis will succeed as well in
future.

This is an atom: 
Throughout the night the pumps were kept, without respite, steadily at
work, but without producing the least sensible benefit.

This is an atom: 
The ship became
so water-logged and heavy that she hardly rose at all to the waves,
which consequently often washed over the deck and contributed their
part towards aggravating our case.

This is an atom: 
Our situation was rapidly becoming as
terrible as it had been when the fire was raging in the midst of us;
and the prospect of being swallowed by the devouring billows was no less
formidable than that of perishing in the flames.

This is an atom: 
Curtis kept the men up to the mark, and, willing or unwilling, they had
no alternative but to work on as best they might; but, in spite of all
their efforts, the water perpetually rose, till, at length, the men in
the hold who were passing the buckets found themselves immersed up to
their waists and were obliged to come on deck.

This is an atom: 
This morning, after a somewhat protracted consultation with Walter and
the boatswain, Curtis resolved to abandon the ship.

This is an atom: 
The only remaining
boat was far too small to hold us all, and it would therefore be
necessary to construct a raft that should carry those who could not find
room in her.

This is an atom: 
Falsten, and ten sailors were
told off to put the raft in hand, the rest of the crew being ordered to
continue their work assiduously at the pumps, until the time came and
everything was ready for embarkation.

This is an atom: 
Hatchet or saw in hand, the carpenter and his assistants made a
beginning without delay by cutting and trimming the spare yards and
extra spars to a proper length.

This is an atom: 
These were then lowered into the sea,
which was propitiously calm, so as to favour the operation (which
otherwise would have been very difficult) of lashing them together into
a firm framework, about forty feet long and twenty-five feet wide, upon
which the platform was to be supported.

This is an atom: 
I kept my own place steadily at the pumps, and Andre Letourneur worked
at my side; I often noticed his father glance at him sorrowfully, as
though he wondered what would become of him if he had to struggle with
waves to which even the strongest man could hardly fail to succumb.

This is an atom: 
But
come what may, his father will never forsake him, and I myself shall not
be wanting in rendering him whatever assistance I can.

This is an atom: 
Kear, who had been for some time in a state of drowsy
unconsciousness, was not informed of the immediate danger, but when
Miss Herbey, looking somewhat pale with fatigue, paid one of her flying
visits to the deck, I warned her to take every precaution for herself
and to be ready for any emergency.

This is an atom: 
"Thank you, doctor, I am always ready," she cheerfully replied, and
returned to her duties below.

This is an atom: 
I saw Andre follow the young girl with his
eyes, and a look of melancholy interest passed over his countenance.

This is an atom: 
Towards eight o'clock in the evening the framework for the raft was
almost complete, and the men were lowering empty barrels, which had
first been securely bunged, and were lashing them to the wood-work to
insure its floating.

This is an atom: 
Two hours later and suddenly there arose the startling cry, "We are
sinking!

This is an atom: 
we are sinking!

This is an atom: 
Kear, followed immediately by Falsten and Miss
Herbey, who were bearing the inanimate form of Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Curtis ran to
his cabin, instantly returning with a chart; a sextant, and a compass in
his hand.

This is an atom: 
The scene that followed will ever be engraven in my memory; the cries of
distress, the general confusion, the frantic rush of the sailors towards
the raft that was not yet ready to support them, can never be forgotten.

This is an atom: 
The whole period of my life seemed to be concentrated into that terrible
moment when the planks bent below my feet and the ocean yawned beneath
me.

This is an atom: 
Some of the sailors had taken their delusive refuge in the shrouds, and
I was preparing to follow them when a hand was laid upon my shoulder.

This is an atom: 
Turning round I beheld M. Letourneur, with tears in his eyes, pointing
towards his son.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, my friend," I said, pressing his hand, "we will
save him, if possible.

This is an atom: 
"

But Curtis had already caught hold of the young man, and was hurrying
him to the main-mast shrouds, when the "Chancellor," which had been
scudding along rapidly with the wind, stopped suddenly, with a violent
shock, and began to settle, The sea rose over my ankles and almost
instinctively I clutched at the nearest rope.

This is an atom: 
All at once, when it
seemed all over, the ship ceased to sink, and hung motionless in
mid-ocean.

This is an atom: 
NIGHT OF DECEMBER 4th.--Curtis caught young Letourneur again in his
arms, and running with him across the flooded deck deposited him safely
in the starboard shrouds, whither his father and I climbed up beside
him.

This is an atom: 
I now had time to look about me.

This is an atom: 
The night was not very dark, and I
could see that Curtis had returned to his post upon the poop; whilst in
the extreme aft near the taffrail, which was still above water, I could
distinguish the forms of Mr.

This is an atom: 
By the assistance of his father, who carefully guided his feet up the
rigging, Andre was hoisted into the main-top.

This is an atom: 
Kear could not be
induced to join him in his elevated position, in spite of being
told that if the wind were to freshen she would inevitably be
washed overboard by the waves; nothing could induce her to listen to
remonstrance, and she insisted upon remaining on the poop, Miss Herbey,
of course, staying by her side.

This is an atom: 
As soon as the captain saw the "Chancellor" was no longer sinking,
he set to work to take down all the sails, yards and all, and the
top-gallants, in the hope that by removing everything that could
compromise the equilibrium of the ship he might diminish the chance of
her capsizing altogether.

This is an atom: 
" I said to Curtis, when I had
joined him for a while upon the poop.

This is an atom: 
"Everything depends upon the weather," he replied, in his calmest
manner; "that, of course, may change at any hour.

This is an atom: 
"

"But do you mean to say," I further asked, "that she can sail with two
feet of water over her deck?

This is an atom: 
Kazallon, she can't sail, but she can drift with the wind, and
if the wind remains in its present quarter, in the course of a few days
we might possibly sight the coast.

This is an atom: 
Besides, we shall have our raft as a
last resource; in a few hours it will be ready, and at daybreak we can
embark.

This is an atom: 
"

"You have not then," I added, "abandoned all hope even yet?

This is an atom: 
"While there's life there's hope, you know Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon; out of a
hundred chances, ninety-nine may be against us, but perhaps the odd one
may be in our favour.

This is an atom: 
Besides, I believe that our case is not without
precedent.

This is an atom: 
In the year 1795 a three-master, the 'Juno,' was precisely
in the same half-sunk, water-logged condition as ourselves; and yet with
her passengers and crew clinging to her top-masts she drifted for twenty
days, until she came in sight of land, when those who had survived the
deprivation and fatigue were saved.

This is an atom: 
So let us not despair; let us hold
on to the hope that the survivors of the 'Chancellor' may be equally
fortunate.

This is an atom: 
"

I was only too conscious that there was not much to be said in support
of Curtis's sanguine view of things, and that the force of reason
pointed all the other way; but I said nothing, deriving what comfort I
could from the fact that the captain did not yet despond of an ultimate
rescue.

This is an atom: 
As it was necessary to be prepared to abandon the ship almost at a
moment's notice, Dowlas was making every exertion to hurry on the
construction of the raft.

This is an atom: 
A little before midnight he was on the point
of conveying some planks for this purpose, when, to his astonishment and
horror, he found that the framework had totally disappeared.

This is an atom: 
The ropes
that had attached it to the vessel had snapped as she became vertically
displaced, and probably it had been adrift for more than an hour.

This is an atom: 
The crew were frantic at this new misfortune, and shouting "Overboard
with the masts!

This is an atom: 
" they began to cut down the rigging preparatory to
taking possession of the masts for a new raft.

This is an atom: 
The ship will not
sink yet, so don't touch a rope until I give you leave.

This is an atom: 
"

The firmness of the captain's voice brought the men to their senses, and
although some of them could ill disguise their reluctance, all returned
to their posts.

This is an atom: 
When daylight had sufficiently advanced Curtis mounted the mast, and
looked around for the missing raft; but it was nowhere to be seen.

This is an atom: 
The
sea was far too rough for the men to venture to take out the whaleboat
in search of it, and there was no choice but to set to work and to
construct a new raft immediately.

This is an atom: 
Since the sea has become so much rougher, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Kear has been induced to
leave the poop, and has managed to join M. Letourneur and his son on
the main-top, where she lies in a state of complete prostration.

This is an atom: 
I need
hardly add that Miss Herbey continues in her unwearied attendance.

This is an atom: 
The
space to which these four people are limited is necessarily very small,
nowhere measuring twelve feet across; to prevent them losing their
balance some spars have been lashed from shroud to shroud, and for the
convenience of the two ladies Curtis has contrived to make a temporary
awning of a sail.

This is an atom: 
Kear has installed himself with Silas Huntly on
the foretop.

This is an atom: 
A few cases of preserved meat and biscuit and some barrels of water,
that floated between the masts after the submersion of the deck, have
been hoisted to the top-masts and fastened firmly to the stays.

This is an atom: 
N. is a
summer month, and unless a breeze should rise to temper the burning sun,
we might expect to suffer from an oppressive heat.

This is an atom: 
The sea still remained very rough, and as the heavy waves broke over the
ship as though she were a reef, the foam flew up to the very top-masts,
and our clothes were perpetually drenched by the spray.

This is an atom: 
The "Chancellor's" hull is three-fourths immerged; besides the three
masts and the bowsprit, to which the whale-boat was suspended, the poop
and the forecastle are the only portions that now are visible; and as
the intervening section of the deck is quite below the water, these
appear to be connected only by the framework of the netting that
runs along the vessel's sides.

This is an atom: 
Communication between the top-masts is
extremely difficult, and would be absolutely precluded, were it not that
the sailors, with practised dexterity, manage to hoist themselves about
by means of the stays.

This is an atom: 
For the passengers, cowering on their narrow
and unstable platform, the spectacle of the raging sea below was truly
terrific; every wave that dashed over the ship shook the masts till they
trembled again, and one could venture scarcely to look or to think lest
he should be tempted to cast himself into the vast abyss.

This is an atom: 
Meanwhile, the crew worked away with all their remaining vigour at the
second raft, for which the top-gallants and yards were all obliged to
be employed; the planks, too, which were continually being loosened
and broken away by the violence of the waves from the partitions of
the ship, were rescued before they had drifted out of reach, and were
brought into use.

This is an atom: 
The symptoms of the ship foundering did not appear
to be immediate; so that Curtis insisted upon the raft being made with
proper care to insure its strength; we were still several hundred miles
from the coast of Guiana, and for so long a voyage it was indispensable
to have a structure of considerable solidity.

This is an atom: 
The reasonableness of this
was self-apparent, and as the crew had recovered their assurance they
spared no pains to accomplish their work effectually.

This is an atom: 
Of all the number, there was but one, an Irishman, named O'Ready, who
seemed to question the utility of all their toil.

This is an atom: 
He is an oldish man, not less than sixty, with his
hair and beard bleached with the storms of many travels.

This is an atom: 
As I was making
my way towards the poop, he came up to me and began talking.

This is an atom: 
"And why, bedad, I'd like to know, why is it that they'll all be afther
lavin' of the ship?

This is an atom: 
"

He turned his quid with the most serene composure, and continued,--

"And isn't it me myself that's been wrecked nine times already?

This is an atom: 
and
sure, poor fools are they that ever have put their trust in rafts or
boats sure and they found a wathery grave.

This is an atom: 
Nay, nay; while the ould ship
lasts, let's stick to her, says I.

This is an atom: 
"

Having thus unburdened his mind he relapsed, into silence, and soon went
away.

This is an atom: 
About three o'clock I noticed that Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kear and Silas Huntly were
holding an animated conversation in the fore top.

This is an atom: 
The petroleum merchant
had evidently some difficulty in bringing the ex-captain round to his
opinion, for I, saw him several times shake his head as he gave long and
scrutinizing looks at the sea and sky.

This is an atom: 
In less than an hour afterwards
I saw Huntly let himself down by the forestays and clamber along to the
forecastle where he joined the group of sailors, and I lost sight of
him.

This is an atom: 
I attached little importance to the incident, and shortly afterwards
joined the party in the main-top, where we continued talking for some
hours.

This is an atom: 
The heat was intense, and if it had not been for the shelter'
afforded by the sail-tent, would have been unbearable.

This is an atom: 
At five o'clock
we took as refreshment some dried meat and biscuit, each individual
being also allowed half a glass of water.

This is an atom: 
Kear, prostrate with
fever, could not touch a mouthful; and nothing could be done by Miss
Herbey to relieve her, beyond occasionally moistening her parched lips.

This is an atom: 
The unfortunate lady suffers greatly, and sometimes I am inclined to
think that she will succumb to the exposure and privation.

This is an atom: 
Not once had
her husband troubled himself about her; but when shortly afterwards I
heard him hail some of the sailors on the forecastle and ask them to
help him down from the foretop, I began to think that the selfish fellow
was coming to join his wife.

This is an atom: 
At first the sailors took no notice of his request, but on his repeating
it with the promise of paying them handsomely for their services, two
of them, Burke and Sandon, swung themselves along the netting into the
shrouds, and were soon at his side.

This is an atom: 
The men evidently were asking more than Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kear was inclined to give, and at one time if seemed as though the
negotiation would fall through altogether.

This is an atom: 
But at length the bargain
was struck, and I saw Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kear take a bundle of paper dollars from his
waistcoat pocket, and hand a number of them over to one of the men,
The man counted them carefully, and from the time it took him, I should
think that he could not have pocketed anything less than a hundred
dollars.

This is an atom: 
The next business was to get Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kear down from the foretop, and
Burke and Sandon proceeded to tie a rope round his waist, which they
afterwards fastened to the forestay; then, in a way which provoked
shouts of laughter from their mates, they gave the unfortunate man a
shove, and sent him rolling down like a bundle of dirty clothes on to
the forecastle.

This is an atom: 
I was quite mistaken as to his object.

This is an atom: 
Kear had no intention of
looking after his wife, but remained by the side of Silas Huntly until
the gathering darkness hid them both from view.

This is an atom: 
As night drew on, the wind grew calmer, but the sea remained very rough.

This is an atom: 
The moon had been up ever since four in the afternoon, though she only
appeared at rare intervals between the clouds.

This is an atom: 
Some long lines of vapour
on the horizon were tinged with a rosy glare that foreboded a strong
breeze for the morrow, and all felt anxious to know from which quarter
the breeze would come, for any but a north-easter would bear the frail
raft on which we were to embark far away from land.

This is an atom: 
About eight o'clock in the evening Curtis mounted to the main-top but
he seemed preoccupied and anxious, and did not speak to any one.

This is an atom: 
He
remained for a quarter of an hour, then after silently pressing my hand,
he returned to his old post.

This is an atom: 
I laid myself down in the narrow space at my disposal, and tried to
sleep; but my mind was filled with strange forebodings, and sleep was
impossible.

This is an atom: 
The very calmness of the atmosphere was oppressive; scarcely
a breath of air vibrated through the metal rigging, and yet the sea rose
with a heavy swell as though it felt the warnings of a coming tempest.

This is an atom: 
All at once, at about eleven o'clock, the moon burst brightly forth
through a rift in the clouds, and the waves sparkled again as if
illumined by a submarine glimmer.

This is an atom: 
I start up and look around me.

This is an atom: 
or do I really see a black speck floating on the
dazzling whiteness of the waters, a speck that cannot be a rock; because
it rises and falls with the heaving motion of the billows?

This is an atom: 
But the moon
once again becomes overclouded; the sea, is darkened, and I return to my
uneasy couch close to the larboard shrouds.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 6th.--I must have fallen asleep for a few hours, when at four
o'clock in the morning, I was rudely aroused by the roaring of the
wind, and could distinguish Curtis's voice as he shouted in the brief
intervals between the heavy gusts.

This is an atom: 
I got up, and holding tightly to the purlin--for the waves made the
masts tremble with their violence--I tried to look around and below me.

This is an atom: 
The sea was literally raging beneath, and great masses of livid-looking
foam were dashing between the masts, which were oscillating
terrifically.

This is an atom: 
It was still dark, and I could only faintly distinguish
two figures on the stern, whom, by the sound of their voices, that I
caught occasionally above the tumult, I made out to be Curtis and the
boatswain.

This is an atom: 
Just at that moment a sailor, who had mounted to the main-top to do
something to the rigging, passed close behind me.

This is an atom: 
"What's the matter?

This is an atom: 
" I asked,

"The wind has changed," he answered, adding something which I could not
hear distinctly, but which sounded like "dead against us.

This is an atom: 
then, thought I, the wind had shifted to the
south-west, and my last night's forebodings had been correct.

This is an atom: 
When daylight at length appeared, I found the wind although not blowing
actually from the south-west, had veered round to the north-west, a
change which was equally disastrous to us, inasmuch as it was carrying
us away from land.

This is an atom: 
Moreover, the ship had sunk considerably during
the night, and there were now five feet of water above deck; the side
netting had completely disappeared, and the forecastle and the poop were
now all but on a level with the sea, which washed over them incessantly.

This is an atom: 
With all possible expedition Curtis and his crew were labouring away
at their raft, but the violence of the swell materially impeded their
operations, and it became a matter of doubt as to whether the woodwork
would not fall asunder before it could be properly fastened together.

This is an atom: 
As I watched the men at their work M. Letourneur, with one arm
supporting his son, came and stood by my side.

This is an atom: 
"Don't you think this main-top will soon give way?

This is an atom: 
" he said, as the
narrow platform on which we stood creaked and groaned with the swaying
of the masts.

This is an atom: 
Kear, who was
lying prostrate at her feet, asked what we thought ought to be done.

This is an atom: 
"We can do nothing but stay where we are," I replied.

This is an atom: 
"No;" said Andre "this is our best refuge; I hope you are not afraid.

This is an atom: 
"

"Not for myself," said the young girl quietly "only for those to whom
life is precious.

This is an atom: 
"Where's the whale boat?

This is an atom: 
"She's gone adrift, then!

This is an atom: 
"

And sure enough the whale-boat was no longer hanging from the bowsprit;
and in a moment the discovery was made that Mr.

This is an atom: 
Afraid
that the "Chancellor" would founder before the completion of the raft,
Kear and Huntly had plotted together to effect their escape, and had
bribed the three sailors to seize the only remaining boat.

This is an atom: 
This, then, was the black speck that I had seen during the night.

This is an atom: 
The
miserable husband had deserted his wife, the faithless captain had
abandoned the ship that had once been under his command.

This is an atom: 
"There are five saved, then," said the boatswain.

This is an atom: 
"Faith, an it's five lost ye'll be maning," said O'Ready; and the state
of the sea fully justified his opinion.

This is an atom: 
The crew were furious when they heard of the surreptitious flight,
and loaded the fugitives with all the invectives they could lay their
tongues to.

This is an atom: 
So enraged were they at the dastardly trick of which they
had been made the dupes, that if chance should bring the deserters again
on board I should be sorry to answer for the consequences.

This is an atom: 
Kear has not been informed of her
husband's disappearance.

This is an atom: 
The unhappy lady is wasting away with a fever
for which we are powerless to supply a remedy, for the medicine chest
was lost when the ship began to sink.

This is an atom: 
Nevertheless, I do not think we
have anything to regret on that score, feeling as I do, that in a case
like Mrs.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 6th CONTINUED.--The "Chancellor" no longer maintained her
equilibrium; we felt that she was gradually going down, and her hull was
probably breaking up.

This is an atom: 
The main-top was already only ten feet above the
water, whilst the bowsprit, with the exception of the extreme end, that
rose obliquely from the waves, was entirely covered.

This is an atom: 
The "Chancellor's" last day, we felt, had come.

This is an atom: 
Fortunately the raft was all but finished, and unless Curtis preferred
to wait till morning we should be able to embark in the evening.

This is an atom: 
The spars that form the framework
are crossed one above another and lashed together with stout ropes, so
that the whole pile rises a couple of feet above the water.

This is an atom: 
The upper
platform is constructed from the planks that were broken from the ship's
sides by the violence of the waves, and which had not drifted away.

This is an atom: 
The
afternoon has been employed in charging the raft with such provisions,
sails, tools, and instruments as we have been able to save.

This is an atom: 
And how can I attempt to give any idea of the feelings with which, one
and all, we now contemplated the fate before us?

This is an atom: 
For my own part I was
possessed rather by a benumbed indifference than by any sense of genuine
resignation.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur was entirely absorbed in his son, who, in
his turn, thought only of his father; at the same time exhibiting a calm
Christian fortitude, which was shown by no one else of the party
except Miss Herbey, who faced her danger with the same brave composure.

This is an atom: 
Incredible as it may seem, Falsten remained the same as ever, occupying
himself with writing down figures and memoranda in his pocket-book.

This is an atom: 
Kear, in spite of all that Miss Herbey could do for her, was evidently
dying.

This is an atom: 
With regard to the sailors, two or three of them were calm enough, but
the rest had well-nigh lost their wits.

This is an atom: 
Some of the more ill-disposed
amongst them seemed inclined to run into excesses; and their conduct,
under the bad influence of Owen and Jynxstrop, made it doubtful whether
they would submit to control when once we were limited to the narrow
dimensions of the raft.

This is an atom: 
Lieutenant Walter, although his courage never
failed him, was worn out with bodily fatigue, and obliged to give up all
active labour; but Curtis and the boatswain were resolute, energetic and
firm as ever.

This is an atom: 
To borrow an expression from the language of metallurgic
art, they were men "at the highest degree of hardness.

This is an atom: 
"

At five o'clock one of our companions in misfortune was released from
her sufferings.

This is an atom: 
Kear, after a most distressing illness, through
which her young companion tended her with the most devoted care, has
breathed her last.

This is an atom: 
A few deep sighs and all was over, and I doubt
whether the sufferer was ever conscious of the peril of, her situation.

This is an atom: 
Towards morning I touched
the dead woman's hand, and it was cold and stiff.

This is an atom: 
The corpse could
not remain any longer on the main-top, and after Miss Herbey and I had
carefully wrapped the garments about it, with a few short prayers the
body of the first victim of our miseries was committed to the deep.

This is an atom: 
As the sea closed over the body I heard one of the men in the shrouds
say,--

"There goes a carcass that we shall be sorry we have thrown away!

This is an atom: 
It was Owen who had spoken, But horrible as were
his words, the conviction was forced upon my mind that the day could not
be far distant when we must want for food.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 7th.--The ship was sinking rapidly; the water had risen to the
fore-top; the poop and forecastle were completely submerged; the top
of the bowsprit had disappeared, and only the three mast-tops projected
from the waves.

This is an atom: 
But all was ready on the raft; an erection had been made on the fore to
hold a mast, which was supported by shrouds fastened to the sides of the
platform; this mast carried a large royal.

This is an atom: 
Perhaps, after all, these few frail planks will carry us to the shore
which the "Chancellor" has failed to reach; at any rate, we cannot yet
resign all hope.

This is an atom: 
We were just on the point of embarking at 7 a.m.

This is an atom: 
when the "Chancellor"
all at once began to sink so rapidly that the carpenter and men who were
on the raft were obliged with all speed to cut the ropes that secured
it to the vessel to prevent it from being swallowed up in the eddying
waters.

This is an atom: 
At the
very moment when the ship was descending into the fathomless abyss, the
raft, our only hope of safety, was drifting off before our eyes.

This is an atom: 
Two
of the sailors and an apprentice, beside themselves with terror, threw
themselves headlong into the sea; but it was evident from the very first
that they were quite powerless to combat the winds and waves.

This is an atom: 
Escape was
impossible; they could neither reach the raft, nor return to the
ship.

This is an atom: 
Curtis tied a rope round his waist and tried to swim to their
assistance; but long before he could reach them the unfortunate men,
after a vain struggle for life, sank below the waves and were seen no
more.

This is an atom: 
Curtis, bruised and beaten with the surf that raged about the
mast-heads, was hauled back to the ship.

This is an atom: 
Meantime, Dowlas and his men, by means of some spars which they used as
oars, were exerting themselves to bring back the raft, which had drifted
about two cables-lengths away; but, in spite of all their efforts, it
was fully an hour,--an hour which seemed to us, waiting as we were with
the water up to the level of the top-masts, like an eternity--before
they succeeded in bringing the raft alongside, and lashing it once again
to the "Chancellor's" main-mast.

This is an atom: 
Not a moment was then to be lost.

This is an atom: 
The waves were eddying like a
whirlpool around the submerged vessel, and numbers of enormous
air-bubbles were rising to the surface of the water.

This is an atom: 
Andre who insisted upon seeing Miss Herbey go first, was helped
safely on to the platform, where his father immediately joined him.

This is an atom: 
In
a very few minutes all except Curtis and old O'Ready had left the
"Chancellor.

This is an atom: 
"

Curtis remained standing on the main-top, deeming it not only his duty,
but his right, to be the last to leave the vessel he had loved so well,
and the loss of which he so much deplored.

This is an atom: 
" cried the captain to the old
Irishman, who did not move.

This is an atom: 
"And is it quite sure ye are that she's sinkin?

This is an atom: 
"

"Faith, then, and I think I will;" and not a moment too soon (for the
water was up to his waist) he jumped on to the raft.

This is an atom: 
Having cast one last, lingering look around him, Curtis then left the
ship; the rope was cut and we went slowly adrift.

This is an atom: 
All eyes were fixed upon the spot where the "Chancellor" lay foundering.

This is an atom: 
The top of the mizzen was the first to disappear, then followed the
main-top; and soon, of what had been a noble vessel, not a vestige was
to be seen.

This is an atom: 
Sink
it cannot; the material of which it is composed is of a kind that
must surmount the waves.

This is an atom: 
But it is questionable whether it will hold
together.

This is an atom: 
The cords that bind it will have a tremendous strain to bear
in resisting the violence of the sea.

This is an atom: 
The most sanguine amongst us
trembles to face the future; the most confident dares to think only of
the present.

This is an atom: 
After the manifold perils of the last seventy-two days'
voyage all are too agitated to look forward without dismay to what in
all human probability must be a time of the direst distress.

This is an atom: 
Vain as the task may seem, I will not pause in my work of registering
the events of our drama, as scene after scene they are unfolded before
our eyes.

This is an atom: 
Of the twenty-eight persons who left Charleston in the "Chancellor,"
only eighteen are left to huddle together upon this narrow raft; this
number includes the five passengers, namely M. Letourneur, Andre,
Miss Herbey, Falsten, and myself; the ship's officers, Captain Curtis,
Lieutenant Walter, the boatswain, Hobart the steward, Jynxstrop the
cook, and Dowlas the carpenter; and seven sailors, Austin, Owen, Wilson,
O'Ready, Burke, Sandon, and Flaypole.

This is an atom: 
Such are the passengers on the raft; it is but a brief task to enumerate
their resources.

This is an atom: 
The greater part of the provisions in the store-room were destroyed at
the time when the ship's deck was submerged, and the small quantity that
Curtis has been able to save will be very inadequate to supply the wants
of eighteen people, who too probably have many days to wait ere they
sight either land or a passing vessel.

This is an atom: 
One cask of biscuit, another of
preserved meat, a small keg of brandy, and two barrels of water complete
our store, so that the utmost frugality in the distribution of our daily
rations becomes absolutely necessary.

This is an atom: 
Of spare clothes we have positively none; a few sails will serve for
shelter by day, and covering by night.

This is an atom: 
Dowlas has his carpenter's tools,
we have each a pocket-knife, and O'Ready an old tin pot; of which he
takes the most tender care; in addition to these, we are in possession
of a sextant, a compass, a chart, and a metal tea-kettle, everything
else that was placed on deck in readiness for the first raft having been
lost in the partial submersion of the vessel.

This is an atom: 
We have one great fear; some there are amongst us whose
courage, moral as well as physical, may give way, and over failing
spirits such as these we may have no control.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 7th CONTINUED.--Our first day on the raft has passed without
any special incident.

This is an atom: 
Here on this raft, just as when we
were on board the 'Chancellor,' I consider myself your captain; and as
your captain, I expect that all of you will strictly obey my orders.

This is an atom: 
Let
me beg of you, one and all, to think solely of our common welfare; let
us work with one heart and with one soul, and may Heaven protect us!

This is an atom: 
"

After delivering these few words with an emotion that evidenced their
earnestness, the captain consulted his compass, and found that the
freshening breeze was blowing from the north.

This is an atom: 
This was fortunate for us,
and no time was to be lost in taking advantage of it to speed us on our
dubious way.

This is an atom: 
Dowlas was occupied in fixing the mast into the socket that
had already been prepared for its reception, and in order to support
it more firmly he placed spurs of wood, forming arched buttresses, on
either side.

This is an atom: 
While he was thus employed the boatswain and the other
seamen were stretching the large royal sail on the yard that had been
reserved for that purpose.

This is an atom: 
By half-past nine the mast was hoisted, and held firmly in its place by
some shrouds attached securely to the sides of the raft; then the
sail was run up and trimmed to the wind, and the raft began to make a
perceptible progress under the brisk breeze.

This is an atom: 
As soon as we had once started, the carpenter set to work to contrive
some sort of a rudder, that would enable us to maintain our desired
direction.

This is an atom: 
Curtis and Falsten assisted him with some serviceable
suggestions, and in a couple of hours' time he had made and fixed to
the back of the raft a kind of paddle, very similar to those used by the
Malays.

This is an atom: 
W. as our position, which, on consulting the chart, proved
to be about 650 miles north-east of the coast of Paramaribo in Dutch
Guiana.

This is an atom: 
Now even under the most favourable circumstances, with trade-winds and
weather always in our favour, we cannot by any chance hope to make more
than ten or twelve miles a day, so that the voyage cannot possibly be
performed under a period of two months.

This is an atom: 
To be sure there is the hope to
be indulged that we may fall in with a passing vessel, but as the part
of the Atlantic into which we have been driven is intermediate between
the tracks of the French and English Transatlantic steamers either
from the Antilles or the Brazils, we cannot reckon at all upon such a
contingency happening in our favour; whilst if a calm should set in,
or worse still, if the wind were to blow from the east, not only two
months, but twice, nay, three times that length of time will be required
to accomplish the passage.

This is an atom: 
At best, however, our provisions, even though used with the greatest
care, will barely last three months.

This is an atom: 
Curtis has called us into
consultation, and as the working of the raft does not require such
labour as to exhaust our physical strength, all have agreed to submit
to a regimen which, although it will suffice to keep us alive, will
certainly not fully satisfy the cravings of hunger and thirst.

This is an atom: 
As far as we can estimate, we have somewhere about 500 lbs.

This is an atom: 
To make this last for three months
we ought not to consume very much more than 5 lbs.

This is an atom: 
a day of each, which,
when divided among eighteen people, will make the daily ration 5 oz.

This is an atom: 
Of water we have certainly
not more than 200 gallons, but by reducing each person's allowance to
a pint a day, we hope to eke out that, too, over the space of three
months.

This is an atom: 
It is arranged that the food shall be distributed under the boatswain's
superintendence every morning at ten o'clock.

This is an atom: 
Each person will then
receive his allowance of meat and biscuit, which may be eaten when and
how he pleases.

This is an atom: 
The water will be given out twice a day--at ten in the
morning and six in the evening; but as the only drinking-vessels in our
possession are the tea-kettle and the old Irishman's tin pot, the water
has to be consumed immediately on distribution.

This is an atom: 
As for the brandy,
of which there are only five gallons, it will be doled out with the
strictest limitation, and no one will be allowed to touch it except with
the captain's express permission.

This is an atom: 
I should not forget that there are two sources from which we may hope to
increase our store.

This is an atom: 
First, any rain that may fall will add to our supply
of water, and two empty barrels have been placed ready to receive it;
secondly, we hope to do something in the way of fishing, and the sailors
have already begun to prepare some lines.

This is an atom: 
All have mutually agreed to abide by the rules that have been laid down,
for all are fully aware that by nothing but the most precise regimen can
we hope to avert the horrors of famine, and forewarned by the fate,
of many who in similar circumstances have miserably perished, we are
determined to do all that prudence can suggest for husbanding our
stores.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 8th to 17th.--When night came we wrapped ourselves in our
sails.

This is an atom: 
For my own part, worn out with the fatigue of the long watch in
the top-mast, I slept for several hours; M. Letourneur and Andre did
the same, and Miss Herbey obtained sufficient rest to relieve the tired
expression that her countenance had lately been wearing.

This is an atom: 
As the raft was not very heavily laden the waves did not
break over it at all, and we were consequently able to keep ourselves
perfectly dry.

This is an atom: 
To say the truth, it was far better for us that the sea
should remain somewhat boisterous, for any diminution in the swell of
the waves would indicate that; the wind had dropped, and it was with a
feeling of regret that when the morning came I had to note down "weather
calm" in my journal.

This is an atom: 
In these low latitudes the heat in the day-time is so intense, and
the sun burns with such an incessant glare, that the entire atmosphere
becomes pervaded with a glowing vapour.

This is an atom: 
The wind, too, blows only in
fitful gusts and through long intervals of perfect calm the sails flap
idly and uselessly against the mast.

This is an atom: 
Curtis and the boatswain, however,
are of opinion that we are not entirely dependent on the wind.

This is an atom: 
Certain
indications, which a sailor's eye alone could detect, make them almost
sure that we are being carried along by a westerly current, that flows
at the rate of three or four miles an hour.

This is an atom: 
If they are not mistaken,
this is a circumstance that may materially assist our progress, and
at which we can hardly fail to rejoice, for the high temperature often
makes our scanty allowance of water quite inadequate to allay our
thirst.

This is an atom: 
But with all our hardships I must confess that our condition is
far preferable to what it was when we were still clinging to the
"Chancellor.

This is an atom: 
" Here at least we have a comparatively solid platform
beneath our feet, and we are relieved from the incessant dread of being
carried down with a foundering vessel.

This is an atom: 
In the day-time we can move about
with a certain amount of freedom, discuss the weather, watch the sea,
and examine our fishing-lines; whilst at night we can rest securely
under the shelter of our sails.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," said Andre Letourneur to me a few
days after we had embarked, "that our time on board the raft passes as
pleasantly as it did upon Ham Rock; and the raft has one advantage even
over the reef, for it is capable of motion.

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes, Andre," replied, "as long as the wind continues favourable the
raft has decidedly the advantage; but supposing the wind shifts, what
then?

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh, we mustn't think about that," he said; "let us keep up our courage
while we can.

This is an atom: 
"

I felt that he was right, and that the dangers we had escaped should
make us more hopeful for the future; and I think that nearly all of us
are inclined to share his opinion.

This is an atom: 
Whether the captain is equally sanguine I am unable to say.

This is an atom: 
He holds
himself very much aloof, and as he evidently feels that he has the great
responsibility of saving other lives than his own, we are reluctant to
disturb his silent meditations.

This is an atom: 
Such of the crew as are not on watch spend the greater portion of their
time in dozing on the fore part of the raft.

This is an atom: 
The aft, by the captain's
orders, has been reserved for the use of us passengers, and by erecting
some uprights we have contrived to make a sort of tent, which affords
some shelter from the burning sun.

This is an atom: 
Lieutenant Walter is the only invalid, and he,
in spite of all our careful nursing, seems to get weaker every day.

This is an atom: 
Andre Letourneur is the life of our party, and I have never appreciated
the young man so well.

This is an atom: 
His originality of perception makes his
conversation both lively and entertaining and as he talks, his wan
and suffering countenance lights up with an intelligent animation.

This is an atom: 
His
father seems to become more devoted to him than ever, and I have seen
him sit for an hour at a time, with his hand resting on his son's,
listening eagerly to his every word.

This is an atom: 
Miss Herbey occasionally joins in our conversation, but although we all
do our best to make her forget that she has lost those who should have
been her natural protectors, M. Letourneur is the only one amongst us to
whom she speaks without a certain reserve.

This is an atom: 
To him, whose age gives him
something of the authority of a father, she has told the history of her
life--a life of patience and self-denial such as not unfrequently falls
to the lot of orphans.

This is an atom: 
She had been, she said, two years with Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Kear, and although now left alone in the world, homeless and without
resources, hope for the future does not fail her.

This is an atom: 
The young lady's
modest deportment and energy of character command the respect of all
on board, and I do not think that even the coarsest of the sailors has
either by word or gesture acted towards her in a way that she could deem
offensive.

This is an atom: 
The wind continued to blow in irregular gusts, but always
in the same direction, and the helm, or rather the paddle at the back of
the raft has never once required shifting; and the watch, who are posted
on the fore, under orders to examine the sea with the most scrupulous
attention, have had no change of any kind to report.

This is an atom: 
At the end of a week we found ourselves growing accustomed to our
limited diet, and as we had no manual exertion, and no wear and tear
of our physical constitution, we managed very well.

This is an atom: 
Our greatest
deprivation was the short supply of water, for, as I said before, the
unmitigated heat made our thirst at times very painful.

This is an atom: 
A shoal of fish, of the sparus tribe,
swarmed round the raft, and although our tackle consisted merely of long
cords baited with morsels of dried meat stuck upon bent nails, the fish
were so voracious that in the course of a couple of days we had caught
as many as weighed almost 200lbs., some of which were grilled, and
others boiled in sea-water over a fire made on the fore part of the
raft.

This is an atom: 
This marvelous haul was doubly welcome, inasmuch as it not only
afforded us a change of diet, but enabled us to economize our stores; if
only some rain had fallen at the same time we should have been more than
satisfied.

This is an atom: 
On
the 17th they all disappeared, and some sharks, not less than twelve or
fifteen feet long, belonging to the species of spotted dog-fish, took
their place.

This is an atom: 
These horrible creatures have black backs and fins, covered
with white spots and stripes.

This is an atom: 
Here, on our low raft, we seem almost on
a level with them, and more than once their tails have struck the spars
with terrible violence.

This is an atom: 
The sailors manage to keep them at a distance
by means of handspikes, but I shall not be surprised if they persist in
following us, instinctively intelligent that we are destined to become
their prey.

This is an atom: 
For myself, I confess that they give me a feeling of
uneasiness; they seem to me like monsters of ill-omen.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 18th to 20th.--On the 18th the wind freshened a little, but as
it blew from the same favourable quarter we did not complain, and only
took the precaution of putting an extra support to the mast, so that it
should not snap with the tension of the sail.

This is an atom: 
This done, the raft was
carried along with something more than its ordinary speed, and left a
long line of foam in its wake.

This is an atom: 
In the afternoon the sky became slightly overclouded, and the heat
consequently somewhat less oppressive.

This is an atom: 
The swell made it more difficult
for the raft to keep its balance, and we shipped two or three heavy
seas; but the carpenter managed to make with some planks a kind of wall
about a couple of feet high, which protected us from the direct action
of the waves.

This is an atom: 
Our casks of food and water were secured to the raft
with double ropes, for we dared not run the risk of their being carried
overboard, an accident that would at once have reduced us to the direst
distress.

This is an atom: 
In the course of the day the sailors gathered some of the marine plants
known by the name of sargassos, very similar to those we saw in such
profusion between the Bermudas and Ham Rock.

This is an atom: 
I advised my companions to
chew the laminary tangles, which they would find contained a saccharine
juice, affording considerable relief to their parched lips and throats.

This is an atom: 
I should not, however,
omit to mention that the frequent conferences held amongst the sailors,
especially between Owen, Burke, Flaypole, Wilson, and Jynxstrop, the
negro, aroused some uneasy suspicions in my mind.

This is an atom: 
What was the subject
of their conversation I could not discover, for they became silent
immediately that a passenger or one of the officers approached them.

This is an atom: 
When I mentioned the matter to Curtis I found he had already noticed
these secret interviews, and that they had given him enough concern to
make him determined to keep a strict eye upon Jynxstrop and Owen, who,
rascals as they were themselves, were evidently trying to disaffect
their mates.

This is an atom: 
The sky was cloudless, and as
there was not enough wind to fill the sail the raft lay motionless
upon the surface of the water.

This is an atom: 
Some of the sailors found a transient
alleviation for their thirst by plunging into the sea, but as we were
fully aware that the water all round was infested with sharks, none of
us was rash enough to follow their example, though if, as seems likely,
we remain long becalmed, we shall probably in time overcome our fears,
and feel constrained to indulge ourselves with a bath.

This is an atom: 
The health of Lieutenant Walter continues to cause us grave anxiety, the
young man being weakened by attacks of intermittent fever.

This is an atom: 
Except for
the loss of the medicine-chest we might have temporarily reduced this by
quinine; but it is only too evident that the poor fellow is consumptive,
and that that hopeless malady is making ravages upon him that no
medicine could permanently arrest.

This is an atom: 
His sharp dry cough, his short
breathing, his profuse perspirations, more especially in the morning;
the pinched-in nose, the hollow cheeks, of which the general pallour is
only relieved by a hectic flush, the contracted lips, the too brilliant
eye and wasted form--all bear witness to a slow but sure decay.

This is an atom: 
To-day, the 20th, the temperature is as high as ever, and the raft still
motionless.

This is an atom: 
The rays of the sun penetrate even through the shelter of
our tent, where we sit literally gasping with the heat.

This is an atom: 
The impatience
with which we awaited the moment when the boatswain should dole out our
meagre allowance of water, and the eagerness with which those lukewarm
drops were swallowed, can only be realized by those who for themselves
have endured the agonies of thirst.

This is an atom: 
Lieutenant Walter suffers more than any of us from the scarcity of
water, and I noticed that Miss Herbey reserved almost the whole of her
own share for his use.

This is an atom: 
Kind and compassionate as ever, the young girl
does all that lies in her power to relieve the poor fellow's sufferings.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," she said to me this morning, "that young man gets
manifestly weaker every day.

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes, Miss Herbey," I replied, "and how sorrowful it is that we can do
nothing for him, absolutely nothing.

This is an atom: 
" she said, with her wonted consideration, "perhaps he will hear
what we are saying.

This is an atom: 
"

And then she sat down near the edge of the raft, where, with her head
resting on her hands, she remained lost in thought.

This is an atom: 
For nearly an
hour Owen, Flaypole, Burke, and Jynxstrop had been engaged in close
conversation and, although their voices were low, their gestures had
betrayed that they were animated by some strong excitement.

This is an atom: 
At the
conclusion of the colloquy Owen got up and walked deliberately to
the quarter of the raft that has been reserved for the use of the
passengers.

This is an atom: 
"Where are you off to now, Owen?

This is an atom: 
"That's my business," said the man insolently, and pursued his course.

This is an atom: 
The boatswain was about to stop him, but before he could interfere
Curtis was standing and looking Owen steadily in the face.

This is an atom: 
"Ah, captain, I've got a word from my mates to say to you," he said,
with all the effrontery imaginable.

This is an atom: 
"We should like to know about that little keg of brandy.

This is an atom: 
Is it being
kept for the porpoises or the officers?

This is an atom: 
"

Finding that he obtained no reply, he went on,--

"Look here, captain, what we want is to have our grog served out every
morning as usual.

This is an atom: 
"What!

This is an atom: 
what!

This is an atom: 
" exclaimed Owen, "don't you mean to let us have our grog?

This is an atom: 
"

For a moment, with a malicious grin upon his lips, Owen stood
confronting the captain; then, as though thinking better of himself,
he turned round and rejoined his companions, who were still talking
together in an undertone.

This is an atom: 
When I was afterwards discussing the matter with Curtis I asked him
whether he was sure he had done right in refusing the brandy.

This is an atom: 
" he cried, "to be sure I have.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 21st.--No further disturbance has taken place amongst the men.

This is an atom: 
For a few hours the fish appeared again, and we caught a great many
of them, and stored them away in an empty barrel.

This is an atom: 
This addition to our
stock of provisions makes us hope that food, at least, will not fail us.

This is an atom: 
Usually the nights in the tropics are cool, but to-day, as evening drew
on, the wonted freshness did not return, but the air remained stifling
and oppressive, whilst heavy masses of vapour hung over the water.

This is an atom: 
There was no moonlight; there would be a new moon at half-past one in
the morning, but the night was singularly dark, except for dazzling
flashes of summer lightning that from time to time illumined the horizon
far and wide.

This is an atom: 
There was, however, no answering roll of thunder, and the
silence of the atmosphere seemed almost awful, For a couple of hours,
in the vain hope of catching a breath of air, Miss Herbey, Andre
Letourneur, and I, sat watching the imposing struggle of the electric
vapours.

This is an atom: 
The clouds appeared like embattled turrets crested with flame,
and the very sailors, coarse-minded men as they were, seemed struck with
the grandeur of the spectacle, and regarded attentively, though with an
anxious eye, the preliminary tokens of a coming storm.

This is an atom: 
Until midnight we
kept our seats upon the stern of the raft, whilst the lightning ever and
again shed around us a livid glare similar to that produced by adding
salt to lighted alcohol.

This is an atom: 
"Are you afraid of a storm, Miss Herbey?

This is an atom: 
Andre, my feelings are always rather those of awe than of
fear," she replied.

This is an atom: 
"I consider a storm one of the sublimest phenomena
that we can behold--don't you think so too?

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes, and especially when the thunder is pealing," he said; "that
majestic rolling, far different to the sharp crash of artillery, rises
and falls like the long-drawn notes of the grandest music, and I can
safely say that the tones of the most accomplished ARTISTE have never
moved me like that incomparable voice of nature.

This is an atom: 
"

"Rather a deep bass, though," I said, laughing.

This is an atom: 
"That may be," he answered; "but I wish we might hear it now, for this
silent lightning is somewhat unexpressive.

This is an atom: 
"

"Never mind that, Andre" I said; "enjoy a storm when it comes, if you
like, but pray don't wish for it.

This is an atom: 
"

"And why not?

This is an atom: 
" said he; "a storm will bring us wind, you know.

This is an atom: 
"

"And water, too," added Miss Herbey, "the water of which we are so
seriously in need.

This is an atom: 
"

The young people evidently wished to regard the storm from their own
point of view, and although I could have opposed plenty of common sense
to their poetical sentiments, I said no more, but let them talk on as
they pleased for fully an hour.

This is an atom: 
Meantime the sky was becoming quite overclouded, and after the zodiacal
constellations had disappeared in the mists that hung round the horizon,
one by one the stars above our heads were veiled in dark rolling
masses of vapour, from which every instant there issued forth sheets of
electricity that formed a vivid background to the dark grey fragments of
cloud that floated beneath.

This is an atom: 
As the reservoir of electricity was confined to the higher strata of the
atmosphere, the lightning was still unaccompanied by thunder; but the
dryness of the air made it a weak conductor.

This is an atom: 
Evidently the fluid could
only escape by terrible shocks, and the storm must ere long burst forth
with fearful violence.

This is an atom: 
The boatswain is only
weather-wise from his experience as a sailor; but Curtis, in addition to
his experience, has some scientific knowledge, and he pointed out to me
an appearance in the sky known to meteorologists as a "cloud-ring,"
and scarcely ever seen beyond the regions of the torrid zone, which are
impregnated by damp vapours brought from all quarters of the ocean by
the action of the trade-winds.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," said Curtis, "our raft has been driven into the
region of storms, of which it has been justly remarked that any one
endowed with very sensitive organs can at any moment distinguish the
growlings of thunder.

This is an atom: 
" I said, as I strained my ears to listen, "I think I can hear it
now.

This is an atom: 
"

"You can," he answered; "yet what you hear is but the first warning of
the storm which, in a couple of hours, will burst upon us with all its
fury.

This is an atom: 
But never mind, we must be ready for it.

This is an atom: 
"

Sleep, even if we wished it, would have been impossible in that stifling
temperature.

This is an atom: 
The lightning increased in brilliancy, and appeared from
all quarters of the horizon, each flash covering large arcs, varying
from 100deg.

This is an atom: 
to 150deg., leaving the atmosphere pervaded by one
incessant phosphorescent glow.

This is an atom: 
The thunder became at length more and more distinct, the reports, if I
may use the expression, being "round," rather than rolling.

This is an atom: 
It seemed
almost as though the sky were padded with heavy clouds of which the
elasticity muffled the sound of the electric bursts.

This is an atom: 
Hitherto, the sea had been calm, almost stagnant as a pond.

This is an atom: 
Now,
however, long undulations took place, which the sailors recognized, all
too well, as being the rebound produced by a distant tempest.

This is an atom: 
A ship, in
such a case, would have been instantly brought ahull, but no manoeuvring
could be applied to our raft, which could only drift before the blast.

This is an atom: 
At one o'clock in the morning one vivid flash, followed, after the
interval of a few seconds, by a loud report of thunder, announced that
the storm was rapidly approaching.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly the horizon was enveloped in
a vapourous fog, and seemed to contract until it was close around us.

This is an atom: 
At
the same instant the voice of one of the sailors was heard shouting,--

"A squall!

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 21st, NIGHT.--The boatswain rushed to the halliards that
supported the sail, and instantly lowered the yard; and not a moment too
soon, for with the speed of an arrow the squall was upon us, and if
it had not been for the sailor's timely warning we must all have been
knocked down and probably precipitated into the sea; as it was, our tent
on the back of the raft was carried away.

This is an atom: 
The raft itself, however, being so nearly level with the water, had
little peril to encounter from the actual wind; but from the mighty
waves now raised by the hurricane we had everything to dread.

This is an atom: 
At first
the waves had been crushed and flattened as it were by the pressure of
the air, but now, as though strengthened by the reaction, they rose with
the utmost fury.

This is an atom: 
The raft followed the motions of the increasing swell,
and was tossed up and down, to and fro, and from side to side with the
most violent oscillations "Lash yourselves tight," cried the boatswain,
as he threw us some ropes; and in a few moments, with Curtis's
assistance, M. Letourneur, Andre, Falsten, and myself were fastened so
firmly to the raft, that nothing but its total disruption could carry us
away.

This is an atom: 
Miss Herbey was bound by a rope passed round her waist to one
of the uprights that had supported our tent, and by the glare of the
lightning I could see that her countenance was as serene and composed as
ever.

This is an atom: 
Flash followed flash, peal followed
peal in quick succession.

This is an atom: 
Our eyes were blinded, our ears deafened, with
the roar and glare.

This is an atom: 
The clouds above, the ocean beneath, seemed verily
to have taken fire, and several times I saw forked lightnings dart
upwards from the crest of the waves, and mingle with those that radiated
from the fiery vault above.

This is an atom: 
A strong odour of sulphur pervaded the air,
but though thunderbolts fell thick around us, not one had touched our
raft.

This is an atom: 
By two o'clock the storm had reached its height.

This is an atom: 
The hurricane had
increased, and the heavy waves, heated to a strange heat by the general
temperature, dashed over us until we were drenched to the skin.

This is an atom: 
Curtis,
Dowlas, the boatswain, and the sailors did what they could to strengthen
the raft with additional ropes.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur placed himself in front
of Andre to shelter him from the waves.

This is an atom: 
Miss Herbey stood upright and
motionless as a statue.

This is an atom: 
Soon dense masses of lurid clouds came rolling up, and a crackling, like
the rattle of musketry, resounded through the air.

This is an atom: 
This was produced by
a series of electrical concussions, in which volleys of hailstones were
discharged from the cloud-batteries above.

This is an atom: 
In fact, as the storm-sheet
came in contact with a current of cold air, hail was formed with great
rapidity, and hailstones, large as nuts, came pelting down, making the
platform of the raft re-echo with a metallic ring.

This is an atom: 
For about half an hour the meteoric shower continued to descend, and
during that time the wind slightly abated in violence; but after having
shifted from quarter to quarter, it once more blew with all its former
fury.

This is an atom: 
The shrouds were broken, but happily the mast, already bending
almost double, was removed by the men from its socket before it should
be snapped short off.

This is an atom: 
One gust caught away the tiller, which went adrift
beyond all power of recovery, and the same blast blew down several of
the planks that formed the low parapet on the larboard side, so that the
waves dashed in without hindrance through the breach.

This is an atom: 
The carpenter and his mates tried to repair the damage, but, tossed from
wave to wave, the raft was inclined to an angle of more than forty-five
degrees, making it impossible for them to keep their footing, and
rolling one over another, they were thrown down by the violent shocks.

This is an atom: 
Why they were not altogether carried away, why we were not all hurled
into the sea, was to me a mystery.

This is an atom: 
Even if the cords that bound us
should retain their hold, it seemed perfectly incredible that the raft
itself should not be overturned, so that we should be carried down and
stifled in the seething waters.

This is an atom: 
At last, towards three in the morning, when the hurricane seemed to be
raging more fiercely than ever, the raft, caught up on the crest of
an enormous wave, stood literally perpendicularly on its edge.

This is an atom: 
For
an instant, by the illumination of the lightning, we beheld ourselves
raised to an incomprehensible height above the foaming breakers.

This is an atom: 
But no; another
moment, and the raft had resumed its horizontal position.

This is an atom: 
Safe, indeed,
we were, but the tremendous upheaval was not without its melancholy
consequences.

This is an atom: 
The cords that secured the cases of provisions had
burst asunder.

This is an atom: 
One case rolled overboard, and the side of one of the
water-barrels was staved in, so that the water which it contained was
rapidly escaping.

This is an atom: 
Two of the sailors rushed forward to rescue the case
of preserved meat; but one of them caught his foot between the planks
of the platform, and, unable to disengage it, the poor fellow stood
uttering-cries of distress.

This is an atom: 
I tried to go to his assistance, and had already untied the cord that
was round me; but I was too late.

This is an atom: 
Another heavy sea dashed over us, and
by the light of a dazzling flash I saw the unhappy man, although he
had managed without assistance to disengage his foot, washed overboard
before it was in my power to get near him.

This is an atom: 
The same ponderous wave laid me prostrate on the platform, and as my
head came in collision with the corner of a spar, for a time I lost all
consciousness.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 22nd.--Daylight came at length, and the sun broke through and
dispersed the clouds that the storm had left behind.

This is an atom: 
The struggle of the
elements, while it lasted, had been terrific, but the swoon into which
I was thrown by my fall, prevented me from observing the final incidents
of the visitation.

This is an atom: 
All that I know is, that shortly after we had shipped
the heavy sea that I have mentioned, a shower of rain had the effect
of calming the severity of the hurricane, and tended to diminish the
electric tension of the atmosphere.

This is an atom: 
Thanks to the kind care of M. Letourneur and Miss Herbey, I recovered
consciousness, but I believe that it is to Robert Curtis that I owe my
real deliverance, for he it was that prevented me from being carried
away by a second heavy wave.

This is an atom: 
The tempest, fierce as it was, did not last more than a few hours;
but even in that short space of time what an irreparable loss we have
sustained, and what a load of misery seems stored up for us in the
future!

This is an atom: 
Of the two sailors who perished in the storm, one was Austin, a fine
active young man of about eight-and-twenty; the other was old O'Ready,
the survivor of so many ship wrecks.

This is an atom: 
Our party is thus reduced to
sixteen souls, leaving a total barely exceeding half the number of those
who embarked on board the "Chancellor" at Charleston.

This is an atom: 
Curtis's first care had been to take a strict account of the remnant of
our provisions.

This is an atom: 
Of all the torrents of rain that fell in the night we
were unhappily unable to catch a single drop; but water will not fail us
yet, for about fourteen gallons still remain in the bottom of the broken
barrel, whilst the second barrel has not yet been touched.

This is an atom: 
The cases containing the dried meat, and the
fish that we had preserved, have both been washed away, and all that now
remains to us is about sixty pounds of biscuit.

This is an atom: 
The day has passed away in silence.

This is an atom: 
A general depression has fallen
upon all: the spectre of famine has appeared amongst us, and each
has remained wrapped in his own gloomy meditations, though each has
doubtless but one idea dominant in his mind.

This is an atom: 
Once, as I passed near the group of sailors lying on the fore part of
the raft, I heard Flaypole say with a sneer,--

"Those who are going to die had better make haste about it.

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes," said Owen, "leave their share of food to others.

This is an atom: 
Some, I noticed, swallowed it ravenously, others reserved it for another
time.

This is an atom: 
Falsten divided his ration into several portions, corresponding,
I believe, to the number of meals to which he was ordinarily accustomed.

This is an atom: 
What prudence he shows!

This is an atom: 
If any one survives this misery, I think it will
be he.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 23rd to 30th--After the storm the wind settled back into its
old quarter, blowing pretty briskly from the north-east.

This is an atom: 
As the breeze
was all in our favour it was important to make the most of it, and
after Dowlas had carefully readjusted the mast, the sail was once more
hoisted, and we were carried along at the rate of two or two and a half
knots an hour.

This is an atom: 
A new rudder, formed of a spar and a good-sized plank,
has been fitted in the place of the one we lost, but with the wind in
its present quarter it is in little requisition.

This is an atom: 
The platform of the
raft has been repaired, the disjointed planks have been closed by means
of ropes and wedges, and that portion of the parapet that was washed
away has been replaced, so that we are no longer wetted by the waves.

This is an atom: 
In
fact, nothing has been left undone to insure the solidity of our raft,
and to render it capable of resisting the wear and tear of the wind and
waves.

This is an atom: 
But the dangers of wind and waves are not those which we have
most to dread.

This is an atom: 
Together with the unclouded sky came a return of the tropical
heat, which during the preceding days had caused us such serious
inconvenience; fortunately on the 23rd the excessive warmth was somewhat
tempered by the breeze, and as the tent was once again put up, we were
able to find shelter under it by turns.

This is an atom: 
But the want of food was beginning to tell upon us sadly, and our sunken
cheeks and wasted forms were visible tokens of what we were enduring.

This is an atom: 
With most of us hunger seemed to attack the entire nervous system, and
the constriction of the stomach produced an acute sensation of pain.

This is an atom: 
A
narcotic, such as opium or tobacco, might have availed to soothe, if not
to cure, the gnawing agony; but of sedatives we had none, so the pain
must be endured.

This is an atom: 
One alone there was amongst us who did not feel the pangs of hunger.

This is an atom: 
Lieutenant Walter seemed as it were to feed upon the fever that raged
within him; but then he was the victim of the most torturing thirst,
Miss Herbey, besides reserving for him a portion of her own insufficient
allowance, obtained from the captain a small extra supply of water, with
which every quarter of an hour she moistened the parched lips of the
young man, who almost too weak to speak, could only express his thanks
by a grateful smile.

This is an atom: 
all our care cannot avail to save him
now; he is doomed, most surely doomed to die.

This is an atom: 
On the 23rd he seemed to be conscious of his condition, for he made
a sign to me to sit down by his side, and then summoning up all his
strength to speak, he asked me in a few broken words how long I
thought he had to live?

This is an atom: 
Slight as my hesitation was, Walter noticed it
immediately.

This is an atom: 
"

"My dear fellow, I am not a doctor, you know," I began, "and I can
scarcely judge--"

"Never mind," he interrupted, "tell me just what you think.

This is an atom: 
"

I looked at him attentively for some moments, then laid my ear against
his chest.

This is an atom: 
In the last few days his malady had made fearfully rapid
strides, and it was only too evident that one lung had already ceased
to act, whilst the other was scarcely capable of performing the work of
respiration.

This is an atom: 
The young man was now suffering from the fever which is the
sure symptom of the approaching end in all tuberculous complaints.

This is an atom: 
The lieutenant kept his eye fixed upon me with a look of eager inquiry.

This is an atom: 
I knew not what to say, and sought to evade his question.

This is an atom: 
"My dear boy," I said, "in our present circumstances not one of us can
tell how long he has to live.

This is an atom: 
Not one of us knows what may happen in the
course of the next eight days.

This is an atom: 
"

"The next eight days," he murmured, as he looked eagerly into my face.

This is an atom: 
And then, turning away his head, he seemed to fall into a sort of doze.

This is an atom: 
The 24th, 25th, and 26th passed without any alteration in our
circumstances, and strange, nay, incredible as it may sound, we began to
get accustomed to our condition of starvation.

This is an atom: 
Often, when reading the
histories of shipwrecks, I have suspected the accounts to be greatly
exaggerated; but now I fully realize their truth, and marvel when I find
on how little nutriment it is possible to exist for so long a time.

This is an atom: 
To
our daily half-pound of biscuit the captain has thought to add a few
drops of brandy, and the stimulant helps considerably to sustain our
strength.

This is an atom: 
If we had the same provisions for two months, or even for one,
there might be room for hope; but our supplies diminish rapidly, and the
time is fast approaching when of food and drink there will be none.

This is an atom: 
The sea had furnished us with food once, and, difficult as the task of
fishing had now become, at all hazards the attempt must be made again.

This is an atom: 
Accordingly the carpenter and the boatswain set to work and made lines
out of some untwisted hemp, to which they fixed some nails that they
pulled out of the flooring of the raft, and bent into proper shape.

This is an atom: 
"I don't mean to say," said he to me, "that these nails are first-rate
fish-hooks; but one thing I do know, and that is, with proper bait they
will act as well as the best.

This is an atom: 
Let me
but just get hold of one fish, and I shall know fast enough how to use
it to catch some more.

This is an atom: 
"

And the true difficulty was how to catch the first fish.

This is an atom: 
It was evident
that fish were not abundant in these waters, nevertheless the lines were
cast.

This is an atom: 
But the biscuit with which they were baited dissolved at once in
the water, and we did not get a single bite.

This is an atom: 
For two days the attempt
was made in vain, and as it only involved what seemed a lavish waste of
our only means of subsistence, it was given up in despair.

This is an atom: 
To-day, the 30th, as a last resource, the boatswain tried what a piece
of coloured rag might do by way of attracting some voracious fish, and
having obtained from Miss Herbey a little piece of the red shawl she
wears, he fastened it to his hook.

This is an atom: 
But still no success; for when,
after several hours, he examined his lines, the crimson shred was still
hanging intact as he had fixed it.

This is an atom: 
The man was quite discouraged at his
failure.

This is an atom: 
"But there will be plenty of bait before long," he said to me in a
solemn undertone.

This is an atom: 
"What do you mean?

This is an atom: 
" said I, struck by his significant manner.

This is an atom: 
What did he insinuate?

This is an atom: 
The words, coming from a man usually so reserved,
have haunted me all night.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 1st to 5th.--More than three months had elapsed since we left
Charleston in the "Chancellor," and for no less than twenty days had
we now been borne along on our raft at the mercy of the wind and waves.

This is an atom: 
Whether we were approaching the American coast, or whether we were
drifting farther and farther to sea, it was now impossible to determine,
for, in addition to the other disasters caused by the hurricane, the
captain's instruments had been hopelessly smashed, and Curtis had no
longer any compass by which to direct his course, nor a sextant by which
he might make an observation.

This is an atom: 
Desperate, however, as our condition might be judged, hope did not
entirely abandon our hearts, and day after day, hour after hour were
our eyes strained towards the horizon, and many and many a time did our
imagination shape out the distant land.

This is an atom: 
But ever and again the illusion
vanished; a cloud, a mist, perhaps even a wave, was all that had
deceived us; no land, no sail ever broke the grey line that united sea
and sky, and our raft remained the centre of the wide and dreary waste.

This is an atom: 
What a rush of sorrowful recollections
overwhelmed our minds!

This is an atom: 
Had we not always associated the opening of
another year with new hopes, new plans, and coming joys?

This is an atom: 
And now, where
were we?

This is an atom: 
Could we dare to look at one another, and breathe a new year's
greeting?

This is an atom: 
"You are surely not going to wish me a happy new year?

This is an atom: 
"No indeed, sir," he replied, "I was only going to wish you well through
the first day of it; and that is pretty good assurance on my part, for
we have not another crumb to eat.

This is an atom: 
"

True as it was, we scarcely realized the fact of there being actually
nothing until on the following morning the hour came round for the
distribution of the scanty ration, and then, indeed, the truth was
forced upon us in a new and startling light.

This is an atom: 
Towards evening I was
seized with violent pains in the stomach, accompanied by a constant
desire to yawn and gape that was most distressing; but in a couple of
hours the extreme agony passed away, and on the 3rd I was surprised to
find that I did not suffer more.

This is an atom: 
I felt, it is true, that there was some
great void within myself, but the sensation was quite as much moral
as physical.

This is an atom: 
My head was so heavy that I could not hold it up; it was
swimming with giddiness, as though I were looking over a precipice.

This is an atom: 
My symptoms were not shared by all my companions, some of whom endured
the most frightful tortures.

This is an atom: 
Dowlas and the boatswain especially, who
were naturally large eaters, uttered involuntary cries of agony,
and were obliged to gird themselves tightly with ropes to subdue the
excruciating pain that was gnawing their very vitals.

This is an atom: 
what would we not have
given for half, nay, for a quarter of the meagre ration which a few days
back we had deemed so inadequate to supply our wants, and which now,
eked out crumb by crumb, might, perhaps, serve for several days?

This is an atom: 
In the
streets of a besieged city, dire as the distress may be, some gutter,
some rubbish-heap, some corner may yet be found that will furnish a
dry bone or a scrap of refuse that may for a moment allay the pangs
of hunger; but these bare planks, so many times washed clean by the
relentless waves, offer nothing to our eager search, and after every
fragment of food that the wind carried into their interstices has been
scraped out devoured, our resources are literally at an end.

This is an atom: 
The nights seem even longer than the days.

This is an atom: 
Sleep, when it comes, brings
no relief; it is rather a feverish stupour, broken and disturbed by
frightful nightmares.

This is an atom: 
At six o'clock this morning I was roused by the sound of angry voices,
and, starting up, I saw Owen and Jynxstrop, with Flaypole, Wilson,
Burke, and Sandon, standing in a threatening attitude.

This is an atom: 
They had taken
possession of the carpenter's tools, and now, armed with hatchets,
chisels, and hammers, they were preparing to attack the captain, the
boatswain, and Dowlas.

This is an atom: 
Falsten followed my example, and although our knives were the only
weapons at our disposal, we were ready to defend ourselves to the very
last extremity.

This is an atom: 
The miserable wretches were
all drunk, for during the night they had knocked a hole in the
brandy-barrel, and had recklessly swallowed its contents.

This is an atom: 
What they
wanted they scarcely seemed to know, but Owen and Jynxstrop, not quite
so much intoxicated as the rest; seemed to be urging them on to massacre
the captain and the officers.

This is an atom: 
" they shouted from time to time in their drunken fury; and,
armed as they were, they appeared completely masters of the situation.

This is an atom: 
" said Curtis sternly, as he advanced to
meet them.

This is an atom: 
" howled Owen, as by word and gesture he
urged on his accomplices.

This is an atom: 
Curtis' pushed aside the excited rascals, and, walking straight up to
Owen, asked him what he wanted.

This is an atom: 
"What do we want?

This is an atom: 
Why, we want no more captains; we are all equals now.

This is an atom: 
as though misery and privation had not already reduced
us all to the same level.

This is an atom: 
"

"Come on, all of you," shouted Owen to his companions, without giving
the slightest heed to Curtis's words.

This is an atom: 
Owen and Wilson attacked Curtis, who defended
himself with a piece of a spar; Burke and Flaypole rushed upon Falsten
and the boatswain, whilst I was left to confront the negro Jynxstrop, who
attempted to strike me with the hammer which he brandished in his hand.

This is an atom: 
I endeavoured to paralyze his movements by pinioning his arms, but the
rascal was my superior in muscular strength.

This is an atom: 
After wrestling for a few
moments, I felt that he was getting the mastery over me when all of a
sudden he rolled over on to the platform, dragging me with him.

This is an atom: 
Andre
Letourneur had caught hold of one of his legs, and thus saved my life.

This is an atom: 
Jynxstrop dropped his weapon in his fall; I seized it instantly, and
was about to cleave the fellow's skull, when I was myself arrested by
Andre's hand upon my arm.

This is an atom: 
By this time the mutineers had been driven back to the forepart of the
raft, and Curtis, who had managed to parry the blows which had been
aimed at him, had caught hold of a hatchet, with which he was preparing
to strike at Owen.

This is an atom: 
But Owen made a sidelong movement to avoid the blow,
and the weapon caught Wilson full in the chest.

This is an atom: 
"It's too late; he's dead!

This is an atom: 
he'll do for--" began the boatswain; but he did not finish
his sentence.

This is an atom: 
Flaypole and Burke were
lying prostrate in a drunken stupour, and Jynxstrop was soon overpowered,
and lashed tightly to the foot of the mast.

This is an atom: 
The carpenter and the
boatswain seized hold of Owen.

This is an atom: 
"Now then," said Curtis, as he raised his blood-stained hatchet, "make
your peace with God, for you have not a moment to live.

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh, you want to eat me, do you?

This is an atom: 
But the audacious reply saved his life; Curtis turned as pale as death,
the hatchet dropped from his hand, and he went and seated himself
moodily on the farthest corner of the raft.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 5th and 6th.--The whole scene made a deep impression on our
minds, and Owen's speech coming as a sort of climax, brought before us
our misery with a force that was well-nigh overwhelming.

This is an atom: 
As soon as I recovered my composure, I did not forget to thank Andre
Letourneur for the act of intervention that had saved my life.

This is an atom: 
"Do you thank me for that; Mr.

This is an atom: 
" he said; "it has only served
to prolong your misery.

This is an atom: 
"

"Never mind, M. Letourneur," said Miss Herbey; "you did your duty.

This is an atom: 
"

Enfeebled and emaciated as the young girl is, her sense of duty never
deserts her, and although her torn and bedraggled garments float
dejectedly about her body, she never utters a word of complaint, and
never loses courage.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," she said to me, "do you think we are fated to die of
hunger?

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes; Miss Herbey, I do," I replied in a hard, cold tone.

This is an atom: 
"How long do you suppose we have to live?

This is an atom: 
"I cannot say; perhaps we shall linger on longer than we imagine.

This is an atom: 
"

"The strongest constitutions suffer the most, do they not?

This is an atom: 
"Yes; but they have one consolation; they die the soonest;" I replied
coldly.

This is an atom: 
Had every spark of humanity died out of my breast that I thus brought
the girl face to face with the terrible truth without a word of hope
or comfort?

This is an atom: 
The eyes of Andre and his father, dilated with hunger, were
fixed upon me, and I saw reproach and astonishment written in their
faces.

This is an atom: 
Afterwards, when we were quite alone, Miss Herbey asked me if I would
grant her a favour.

This is an atom: 
"Certainly, Miss Herbey; anything you like to ask," I replied; and this
time my manner was kinder and more genial.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," she said, "I am weaker than you, and shall probably die
first.

This is an atom: 
Promise me that, if I do, you will throw my body into the sea.

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh, Miss Herbey," I began, "it was very wrong of me to speak to you as
I did!

This is an atom: 
"

"No, no," she replied, half smiling; "you were quite right.

This is an atom: 
But it is
a weakness of mine; I don't mind what they do with me as long as I am
alive, but when I am dead--" she stopped and shuddered.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, promise me
that you will throw me into, the sea!

This is an atom: 
"

I gave her the melancholy promise, which she acknowledged by pressing my
hand feebly with her emaciated fingers.

This is an atom: 
At times my sufferings were so intense that
cries of agony involuntarily escaped my lips; then I became calmer, and
sank into a kind of lethargy.

This is an atom: 
When I awoke, I was surprised to find my
companions still alive.

This is an atom: 
The one of our party who seems to bear his privations the best is Hobart
the steward, a man with whom hitherto I have had very little to do.

This is an atom: 
He
is small, with a fawning expression remarkable for its indecision, and
has a smile which is incessantly playing round his lips; he goes about
with his eyes half-closed, as though he wished to conceal his thoughts,
and there is something altogether false and hypocritical about his whole
demeanour.

This is an atom: 
I cannot say that he bears his privations without a murmur,
for he sighs and moans incessantly; but, with it all, I cannot but
think that there is a want of genuineness in his manner, and that the
privation has not really told upon him as much as it has upon the rest
of us.

This is an atom: 
I have my suspicions about the man, and intend to watch him
carefully.

This is an atom: 
To-day, the 6th, M. Letourneur drew me aside to the stern of
the raft, saying that he had a secret to communicate, but that he wished
neither to be seen nor heard speaking to me.

This is an atom: 
I withdrew with him to
the larboard corner of the raft; and, as it was growing dusk, nobody
observed what we were doing.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," M. Letourneur began in a low voice, "Andre is dying of
hunger: he is growing weaker and weaker, and oh!

This is an atom: 
I cannot, will not see
him die!

This is an atom: 
"

He spoke passionately, almost fiercely, and I fully understood his
feelings.

This is an atom: 
Taking his hand, I tried to reassure him.

This is an atom: 
"We will not despair yet," I said, "perhaps some passing ship--"

"Ship!

This is an atom: 
" he cried impatiently, "don't try to console me with empty
commonplaces; you know as well as I do that there is no chance of
falling in with a passing ship.

This is an atom: 
" Then, breaking off suddenly, he
asked,--"How long is it since my son and all of you have had anything to
eat?

This is an atom: 
"

Astonished at his question, I replied that it was now four days since
the biscuit had failed.

This is an atom: 
"Four days," he repeated; "well, then, it is eight since I have tasted
anything.

This is an atom: 
I have been saving my share for my son.

This is an atom: 
"

Tears rushed to my eyes; for a few moments I was unable to speak, and
could only once more grasp his hand in silence.

This is an atom: 
"What do you want me to do?

This is an atom: 
not so loud; some one will hear us," he said, lowering his voice,
"I want you to offer it to Andre as though it came from yourself.

This is an atom: 
He
would not accept it from me; he would think I had been depriving myself
for him.

This is an atom: 
Let me implore you to do me this service and for your trouble,"
and here he gently stroked my hand, "for your trouble you shall have a
morsel for yourself.

This is an atom: 
"

I trembled like a child as I listened to the poor father's words, and
my heart was ready to burst when I felt a tiny piece of biscuit slipped
into my hand.

This is an atom: 
"Give it him," M. Letourneur went on under his breath, "give it him; but
do not let any one see you; the monsters would murder you if they knew
it.

This is an atom: 
This is only for to-day; I will give you some more to-morrow.

This is an atom: 
"

The poor fellow did not trust me, and well he might not, for I had the
greatest difficulty to withstand the temptation to carry the biscuit to
my mouth, But I resisted the impulse, and those alone who have suffered
like me can know what the effort was.

This is an atom: 
Night came on with the rapidity peculiar to these low latitudes, and I
glided gently up to Andre and slipped the piece of biscuit into his hand
as "a present from myself.

This is an atom: 
I assured him that his father and I had each had our share, and that he
must eat this now, and, perhaps, I should be able to bring him some more
another time.

This is an atom: 
Andre asked no more questions, and eagerly devoured the
morsel of food.

This is an atom: 
So this evening at least, notwithstanding M. Letourneur's offer, I have
tasted nothing.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 7th.--During the last few days since the wind has freshened, the
salt water constantly dashing over the raft has terribly punished the
feet and legs of some of the sailors.

This is an atom: 
Owen, whom the boatswain ever
since the revolt kept bound to the mast, is in a deplorable state, and
at our request has been released from his restraint.

This is an atom: 
Sandon and Burke
are also suffering from the severe smarting caused in this way, and
it is only owing to our more sheltered position on the aft-part of the
raft, that we have not; all shared the same inconvenience.

This is an atom: 
Today the boatswain, maddened by starvation, laid hands upon everything
that met his voracious eyes, and I could hear the grating of his teeth
as he gnawed at fragments of sails and bits of wood, instinctively
endeavouring to fill his stomach by putting the mucus' into circulation
at length, by dint of an eager search, he came upon a piece of leather
hanging to one of the spars that supported the platform.

This is an atom: 
He snatched
it off and devoured it greedily, and as it was animal matter, it really
seemed as though the absorption of the substance afforded him some
temporary relief.

This is an atom: 
Instantly we all followed his example; a leather hat,
the rims of caps, in short, anything that contained any animal matter
at all, were gnawed and sucked with the utmost avidity.

This is an atom: 
We were no longer human, the impulses and instincts of
brute beasts seemed to actuate our every movement.

This is an atom: 
For a moment the pangs of hunger were somewhat allayed; but some of us
revolted against the loathsome food, and were seized either with
violent nausea or absolute sickness.

This is an atom: 
I must be pardoned for giving these
distressing details, but how otherwise can I depict the misery, moral
and physical, which we are enduring?

This is an atom: 
And with it all, I dare not venture
to hope that we have reached the climax of our sufferings.

This is an atom: 
The conduct of Hobart during the scene that I have just described has
only served to confirm my previous suspicions of him.

This is an atom: 
He took no part
in the almost fiendish energy with which we gnawed at our scraps of
leather, and although by his conduct and perpetual groanings, he might
be considered to be dying of inanition, yet to me he has the appearance
of being singularly exempt from the tortures which we are all enduring.

This is an atom: 
But whether the hypocrite is being sustained, by some secret store of
food, I have been unable to discover.

This is an atom: 
Whenever the breeze drops the heat is overpowering; but although our
allowance of water is very meagre, at present the pangs of hunger far
exceed the pain of thirst.

This is an atom: 
It has often been remarked that extreme
thirst is far less endurable than extreme hunger.

This is an atom: 
Is it possible that
still greater agonies are in store for us?

This is an atom: 
I cannot, dare not, believe
it.

This is an atom: 
Fortunately, the broken barrel still contains a few pints of water,
and the other one has not yet been opened.

This is an atom: 
But I am glad to say that
notwithstanding our diminished numbers, and in spite of some opposition,
the captain has thought right to reduce the daily allowance to half a
pint for each person.

This is an atom: 
As for the brandy, of which there is only a quart
now left, it has been stowed away safely in the stern of the raft.

This is an atom: 
This evening has ended the sufferings of another of our companions,
making our number now only fourteen.

This is an atom: 
My attentions and Miss Herbey's
nursing could do nothing for Lieutenant Walter, and about half-past
seven he expired in my arms.

This is an atom: 
Before he died, in a few broken words he thanked Miss Herbey and myself
for the kindness we had shown him.

This is an atom: 
A crumpled letter fell from his hand,
and in a voice that was scarcely audible from weakness, he said,--

"It is my mother's letter: the last I had from her--she was expecting me
home; but she will never see me more.

This is an atom: 
Oh, put it to my lips--let me kiss
it before I die.

This is an atom: 
"

I placed the letter in his cold hand, and raised it to his lips; his eye
lighted for a moment; we heard the faint sound of a kiss, and all was
over!

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 8th.--All night I remained by the side of the poor fellow's
corpse, and several times Miss Herbey joined me in my mournful watch.

This is an atom: 
Before daylight dawned the body was quite cold, and as I knew there must
be no delay in throwing it overboard, I asked Curtis to assist me in
the sad office.

This is an atom: 
The body was frightfully emaciated, and I had every hope
that it would not float.

This is an atom: 
As soon as it was quite light, taking every precaution that no one
should see what we were about, Curtis and I proceeded to our melancholy
task.

This is an atom: 
We took a few articles from the lieutenant's pockets, which we
purposed, if either of us should survive, to remit to his mother.

This is an atom: 
But as
we wrapped him in his tattered garments that would have to suffice for
his winding-sheet, I started back with a thrill of horror.

This is an atom: 
The right
foot had gone, leaving the leg a bleeding stump!

This is an atom: 
No doubt that, overcome by fatigue, I must have fallen asleep for
an interval during the night, and some one had taken advantage of my
slumber to mutilate the corpse.

This is an atom: 
But who could have been guilty of so
foul a deed!

This is an atom: 
Curtis looked around with anger flashing In his eye; but
all seemed as usual, and the silence was only broken by a few groans of
agony.

This is an atom: 
But there was no time to be lost; perhaps we were already observed, and
more horrible scenes might be likely to occur.

This is an atom: 
Curtis said a few short
prayers, and we cast the body into the sea.

This is an atom: 
"They are feeding the sharks well, and no mistake," said a voice behind
me.

This is an atom: 
I turned round quickly, and found that it was Jynxstrop who had spoken.

This is an atom: 
As the boatswain now approached, I asked him whether he thought it
possible that any of the wretched men could have taken the dead man's
foot.

This is an atom: 
"Oh yes, I dare say," he replied, in a significant tone "and perhaps
they thought they were right.

This is an atom: 
what do you mean?

This is an atom: 
"Well, sir," he said coldly, "isn't it better to eat a dead man than a
living one?

This is an atom: 
"

I was at a loss to comprehend him, and, turning away, laid myself down
at the end of the raft.

This is an atom: 
The
boatswain, who had cast his lines early in the morning, caught three
large cod, each more than thirty inches long, of the species which, when
dried, is known by the name of stock-fish.

This is an atom: 
Scarcely had he hauled them
on board, when the sailors made a dash at them, and it was with the
utmost difficulty that Curtis, Falsten, and myself could restore order,
so that we might divide the fish into equal portions.

This is an atom: 
Three cod were not
much amongst fourteen starving persons, but, small as the quantity was,
it was allotted in strictly equal shares.

This is an atom: 
Most of us devoured the food
raw, almost I might say, alive; only Curtis, Andre and Miss Herbey
having the patience to wait until their allowance had been boiled at a
fire which they made with a few scraps of wood.

This is an atom: 
For myself, I confess
that I swallowed my portion of fish just as it was,--raw and bleeding.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur followed my example; the poor man devoured his food like
a famished wolf, and it is only a wonder to me how, after his lengthened
fast, he came to be alive at all.

This is an atom: 
The boatswain's delight at his success was, excessive, and amounted
almost to delirium.

This is an atom: 
I went up to him, and encouraged him to repeat his
attempt.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes," he said; "I'll try again.

This is an atom: 
"

"And why not try at once," I asked.

This is an atom: 
"Not now," he said evasively; "the night is the best time for catching
large fish.

This is an atom: 
Besides, I must manage to get some bait, for we have been
improvident enough not to save a single scrap.

This is an atom: 
"

"But you have succeeded once without bait; why may you not succeed
again?

This is an atom: 
He steadily returned my gaze, but said nothing.

This is an atom: 
"Have you none left?

This is an atom: 
" he almost whispered and left me without another word.

This is an atom: 
Our meal, meagre as it had been, served to rally our shattered energies;
our hopes were slightly raised; there was no reason why the boatswain
should not have the same good luck again.

This is an atom: 
One evidence of the degree to which our spirits were revived was that
our minds were no longer fixed upon the miserable present and hopeless
future, but we began to recall and discuss the past; and M. Letourneur,
Andre Mr.

This is an atom: 
Falsten, and I held a long conversation with the captain
about the various incidents of our eventful voyage, speaking of our lost
companions, of the fire, of the stranding of the ship, of our sojourn
on Ham Rock, of the springing of the leak, of our terrible voyage in the
top-masts, of the construction of the raft, and of the storm.

This is an atom: 
All these
things seemed to have happened so long ago, and yet we were living
still.

This is an atom: 
Living, did I say?

This is an atom: 
Ay, if such an existence as ours could be
called a life, fourteen of us were living still.

This is an atom: 
Who would be the next
to go?

This is an atom: 
During the night the boatswain cast his lines from the stern of the
raft, and, unwilling to trust them to any one else, remained watching
them himself.

This is an atom: 
In the morning I went to ascertain what success had
attended his patience.

This is an atom: 
It was scarcely light, and with eager eyes he was
peering down into the water.

This is an atom: 
He had neither seen nor heard me coming.

This is an atom: 
"Those villainous sharks have eaten every morsel of my bait," he said,
in a desponding voice.

This is an atom: 
"And you have no more left?

This is an atom: 
Then grasping my arm he added, "and that only shows
me that it is no good doing things by halves.

This is an atom: 
"

The truth flashed upon me at once, and I laid my hand upon his mouth.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 9th and 10th.--On the 9th the wind dropped, and there was a dead
calm; not a ripple disturbed the surface of the long undulations as
they rose and fell beneath us; and if it were not for the slight current
which is carrying us we know not whither, the raft would be absolutely
stationary.

This is an atom: 
The heat was intolerable; our thirst more intolerable still; and now it
was that for the first time I fully realized how the insufficiency of
drink could cause torture more unendurable than the pangs of hunger.

This is an atom: 
Mouth, throat, pharynx, all alike were parched and dry, every gland
becoming hard as horn under the action of the hot air we breathed.

This is an atom: 
At
my urgent solicitation the captain was for once induced to double our
allowance of water; and this relaxation of the ordinary rule enabled us
to attempt to slake our thirst four times in the day, instead of only
twice.

This is an atom: 
I use the word "attempt" advisedly; for the water at the bottom
of the barrel, though kept covered by a sail, became so warm that it was
perfectly flat and unrefreshing.

This is an atom: 
It was a most trying day, and the sailors relapsed into a condition of
deep despondency.

This is an atom: 
The moon was nearly full, but when she rose the breeze
did not return.

This is an atom: 
Continuance of high temperature in daytime is a sure
proof that we have been carried far to the south, and here, on this
illimitable ocean, we have long ceased even to look for land; it might
almost seem as though this globe of ours had veritably become a liquid
sphere!

This is an atom: 
To-day we are still becalmed, and the temperature is as high as ever.

This is an atom: 
The air is heated like a furnace, and the sun scorches like fire.

This is an atom: 
The
torments of famine are all forgotten: our thoughts are concentrated with
fevered expectation upon the longed-for moment when Curtis shall dole
out the scanty measure of lukewarm water that makes up our ration.

This is an atom: 
At least,
it seems as if we then could die in peace!

This is an atom: 
About noon we were startled by sharp cries of agony, and looking round I
saw Owen writhing in the most horrible convulsions.

This is an atom: 
I went towards him,
for, detestable as his conduct had been, common humanity prompted me to
see whether I could afford him any relief.

This is an atom: 
But before I reached him, a
shout from Flaypole arrested my attention.

This is an atom: 
The man was up in the mast, and with great excitement pointing to the
east.

This is an atom: 
Even Owen stopped his cries
and stood erect.

This is an atom: 
It was quite true that in the direction indicated by
Flaypole there was a white speck visible upon the horizon.

This is an atom: 
But did it
move?

This is an atom: 
I glanced at Curtis
as he stood with folded arms intently gazing at the distant point.

This is an atom: 
His
brow was furrowed, and he contracted every feature, as with half-closed
eyes, he concentrated his power of vision upon that one faint spot in
the far-off horizon.

This is an atom: 
I looked again,
but the spot was no longer there.

This is an atom: 
If it were a ship, that ship had
disappeared; but probably it had been a mere reflection, or, more likely
still, only the crest of some curling wave.

This is an atom: 
All returned to
their accustomed places.

This is an atom: 
Curtis alone remained motionless, but his eye
no longer scanned the distant view.

This is an atom: 
Owen now began to shriek more wildly than ever.

This is an atom: 
He presented truly a
most melancholy sight; he writhed with the most hideous contortions,
and had all the appearance of suffering from tetanus.

This is an atom: 
His throat was
contracted by repeated spasms, his tongue was parched, his body swollen,
and his pulse, though feeble, was rapid and irregular.

This is an atom: 
The poor wretch's
symptoms were precisely such as to lead us to suspect that he had
taken some corrosive poison.

This is an atom: 
Of course it was quite out of our power
to administer any antidote; all that we could devise was to make him
swallow something that might act as an emetic.

This is an atom: 
As the contents of the broken barrel were
now exhausted, the captain, in order to comply with my request, was
about to tap the other barrel, when Owen started suddenly to his knees,
and with a wild, unearthly shriek, exclaimed,--

"No!

This is an atom: 
of that water I will not touch a drop.

This is an atom: 
"

I supposed he did not understand what we were going to do, and
endeavoured to explain; but all in vain; he persisted in refusing to
taste the water in the second barrel.

This is an atom: 
I then tried to induce vomiting
by tickling his uvula, and he brought off some bluish secretion from his
stomach, the character of which confirmed our previous suspicions--that
he had been poisoned by oxide of copper.

This is an atom: 
We now felt convinced that
any efforts on our part to save him would be of no avail.

This is an atom: 
The vomiting,
however, had for the time relieved him, and he was able to speak.

This is an atom: 
Curtis and I both implored him to let us know what he had taken to bring
about consequences so serious.

This is an atom: 
His reply fell upon us as a startling
blow.

This is an atom: 
The ill fated wretch had stolen several pints of water from the barrel
that had been untouched, and that water had poisoned him!

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 11th to 14th.--Owen's convulsions returned with increased
violence, and in the course of the night he expired in terrible agony.

This is an atom: 
His body was thrown overboard almost directly; it had decomposed so
rapidly that the flesh had not even consistency enough for any fragments
of it to be reserved for the boatswain to use to bait his lines.

This is an atom: 
A
plague the man had been to us in his life; in his death he was now of no
service!

This is an atom: 
And now, perhaps, still more than ever, did the horror of our situation
stare us in the face.

This is an atom: 
There was no doubt that the poisoned barrel had
at some time or other contained copperas; but what strange fatality had
converted it into a water-cask, or what fatality, stranger still, had
caused it to be brought on board the raft, was a problem that none could
solve.

This is an atom: 
Little, however, did it matter now: the fact was evident; the
barrel was poisoned, and of water we had not a drop.

This is an atom: 
We were too irritable
to bear the sound of each other's voices; and it did not require a
word, a mere look or gesture was enough, to provoke us to anger that was
little short of madness.

This is an atom: 
How it was that we did not all become raving
maniacs, I cannot tell.

This is an atom: 
Throughout the 12th no drain of moisture crossed our lips, and not
a cloud arose to warrant the expectation of a passing shower; in
the shade, if shade it might be called, the thermometer would have
registered at least 100deg., and, perhaps, considerably more.

This is an atom: 
The salt water began to chafe my legs, but although
the smarting was at times severe, it was an inconvenience to which I
gave little heed; others who had suffered from the same trouble had
become no worse.

This is an atom: 
if this water that surrounds us could be reduced to
vapour or to ice!

This is an atom: 
its particles of salt extracted, it would be available
for drink.

This is an atom: 
we have no appliances, and we must suffer on.

This is an atom: 
At the risk of being devoured by the sharks, the boatswain and two
sailors took a morning bath, and as their plunge seemed to refresh them,
I and three of my companions resolved to follow their example.

This is an atom: 
We had
never learnt to swim, and had to be fastened to the end of a rope and
lowered into the water; while Curtis during the half-hour of our bath,
kept a sharp look-out to give warning of any danger from approaching
sharks.

This is an atom: 
No recommendation, however, on our part, nor any representation
of the benefit we felt we had derived, could induce Miss Herbey to allay
her sufferings in the same way.

This is an atom: 
At about eleven o'clock, the captain came up to me, and whispered in my
ear,--

"Don't say a word, Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon; I do not want to raise false hopes, but
I think I see a ship.

This is an atom: 
"

It was as well that the captain had warned me; otherwise, I should
have raised an involuntary shout of joy; as it was, I had the greatest
difficulty in restraining my expressions of delight.

This is an atom: 
"Look behind to larboard," he continued in an undertone.

This is an atom: 
Affecting an indifference which I was far from feeling, I cast an
anxious glance to that quarter of the horizon of which he spoke, and
there, although mine is not a nautical eye, I could plainly distinguish
the outline of a ship under sail.

This is an atom: 
Almost at the same moment the boatswain who happened to be looking in
the same direction, raised the cry, "Ship ahoy!

This is an atom: 
"

Whether it was that no one believed it, or whether all energies were
exhausted, certain it is that the announcement produced none of
the effects that might have been expected.

This is an atom: 
Not a soul exhibited the
slightest emotion, and it was only when the boatswain had several times
sung out his tidings that all eyes turned to the horizon.

This is an atom: 
There, most
undeniably, was the ship, and the question rose at once to the minds of
all, and to the lips of many, "Would she see us?

This is an atom: 
"

The sailors immediately began discussing the build of the vessel, and
made all sorts of conjectures as to the direction she was taking.

This is an atom: 
After examining her attentively
for some time, he said, "She is a brig running close upon the wind, on
the starboard tack, If she keeps her course for a couple of hours, she
will come right athwart our track.

This is an atom: 
The ship might change her course at any moment; closely
trimmed as she was, it was very probable that she was only tacking about
to catch the wind, in which case, as soon as she felt a breeze, she
would resume her larboard tack and make away again.

This is an atom: 
On the other hand,
if she were really sailing with the wind, she would come nearer to us,
and there would be good ground for hope.

This is an atom: 
Meantime, no exertion must be spared, and no means left untried, to make
our position known.

This is an atom: 
The brig was about twelve miles to the east of us,
so that it was out of the question to think of any cries of ours being
overheard; but Curtis gave directions that every possible signal should
be made.

This is an atom: 
We had no fire-arms by which we could attract attention, and
nothing else occurred to us beyond hoisting a flag of distress.

This is an atom: 
Miss
Herbey's red shawl, as being of a colour most distinguishable against
the background of sea and sky, was run up to the mast-head, and was
caught by the light breeze that just then was ruffling the surface of
the water.

This is an atom: 
As a drowning man clutches at a straw, so our hearts bounded
with hope every time that our poor flag fluttered in the wind.

This is an atom: 
The ship
was evidently making her way in the direction of the raft, but every
now and then she seemed to stop, and then our hearts would almost stand
still with agony lest she was going to put about.

This is an atom: 
She carried all
her canvas, even to her royals and stay-sails, but her hull was only
partially visible above the horizon.

This is an atom: 
How slowly she advanced!

This is an atom: 
The breeze was very, very feeble, and perhaps
soon it would drop altogether!

This is an atom: 
We felt that we would give years of our
life to know the result of the coming hour!

This is an atom: 
At half-past twelve the captain and the boatswain considered that the
brig was about nine miles away; she had, therefore, gained only three
miles in an hour and a half, and it was doubtful whether the light
breeze that had been passing over our heads had reached her at all.

This is an atom: 
I
fancied, too, that her sails were no longer filled, but were hanging
loose against her masts.

This is an atom: 
Turning to the direction of the wind I tried to
make out some chance of a rising breeze; but no, the waves were calm and
torpid, and the little puff of air that had aroused our hopes had died
away across the sea.

This is an atom: 
I stood aft with M. Letourneur, Andre and Miss Herbey, and our glances
perpetually wandered from the distant ship to our captain's face.

This is an atom: 
Curtis
stood leaning against the mast, with the boatswain by his side; their
eyes seemed never for a moment to cease to watch the brig, but their
countenances clearly expressed the varying emotions that passed through
their minds.

This is an atom: 
Not a word was uttered, nor was the silence broken, until
the carpenter exclaimed, in accents of despair,--

"She's putting about!

This is an atom: 
"

All started up: some to their knees, others to their feet, The boatswain
dropped a frightful oath.

This is an atom: 
The ship was still nine miles away, and at
such a distance it was impossible for our signal to be seen; our
tiny raft, a mere speck upon the waters, would be lost in the intense
irradiation of the sunbeams.

This is an atom: 
If only we could be seen, no doubt all
would be well; no captain would have the barbarous inhumanity to leave
us to our fate; but there had been no chance; only too well we knew that
we had not been within the range of sight.

This is an atom: 
"My friends," said Curtis, "we must make a fire; it is our last and only
chance.

This is an atom: 
"

Some planks were quickly loosened and thrown into a heap upon the fore
part of the raft.

This is an atom: 
They were damp and troublesome to light; but the very
dampness made the smoke more dense, and ere long a tall column of dusky
fumes was rising straight upwards in the air.

This is an atom: 
If darkness should come
on before the brig was completely out of view, the flames we hoped might
still be visible.

This is an atom: 
But the hours passed on; the fire died out; and yet no
signs of help.

This is an atom: 
The temper of resignation now deserted me entirely; faith, hope,
confidence--all vanished from my mind, and like the boatswain, I swore
long and loudly.

This is an atom: 
A gentle hand was laid upon my arm, and turning round I
saw Miss Herbey with her finger pointing to the sky.

This is an atom: 
I could stand it
no longer, but gliding underneath the tent I hid my face in my hands and
wept aloud.

This is an atom: 
Meanwhile the brig had altered her tack, and was moving slowly to the
east.

This is an atom: 
Three hours later and the keenest eye could not have discerned her
top-sails above the horizon.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 15th.--After this further shattering of our excited hopes death
alone now stares us in the face; slow and lingering as that death may
be, sooner or later it must inevitably come.

This is an atom: 
To-day some clouds that rose in the west have brought us a few puffs
of wind; and in spite of our prostration, we appreciate the moderation,
slight as it is, in the temperature.

This is an atom: 
To my parched throat the air seemed
a little less trying but it is now seven days since the boatswain took
his haul of fish, and during that period we have eaten nothing even
Andre Letourneur finished yesterday the last morsel of the biscuit which
his sorrowful and self-denying father had entrusted to my charge.

This is an atom: 
Jynxstrop the negro has broken loose from his confinement, but Curtis has
taken no measures for putting him again under restraint.

This is an atom: 
It is not to be
apprehended that the miserable fellow and his accomplices, weakened as
they are by their protracted fast, will attempt to do us any mischief
now.

This is an atom: 
Some huge sharks made their appearance to-day, cleaving the water
rapidly with their great black fins.

This is an atom: 
The monsters came close up to the
edge of the raft, and Flaypole, who was leaning over, narrowly escaped
having his arm snapped off by one of them.

This is an atom: 
I could not help regarding
them as living sepulchres, which ere long might swallow up our miserable
carcasses; yet, withal, I profess that my feelings were rather those of
fascination than of horror.

This is an atom: 
The boatswain, who stood with clenched teeth and dilated eye, regarded
these sharks from quite another point of view.

This is an atom: 
He thought about
devouring the sharks, not about the sharks devouring him; and if he
could succeed in catching one, I doubt if one of us would reject the
tough and untempting flesh.

This is an atom: 
He determined to make the attempt, and as
he had no whirl which he could fasten to his rope he set to work to
find something that might serve as a substitute.

This is an atom: 
Curtis and Dowlas
were consulted, and after a short conversation, during which they kept
throwing bits of rope and spars into the water in order to entice the
sharks to remain by the raft, Dowlas went and fetched his carpenter's
tool, which is at once a hatchet and a hammer.

This is an atom: 
Of this he proposed to
make the whirl of which they were in need, under the hope that either
the sharp edge of the adze or the pointed extremity opposite would stick
firmly into the jaws of any shark that might swallow it.

This is an atom: 
The wooden
handle of the hammer was secured to the rope, which, in its turn, was
tightly fastened to the raft.

This is an atom: 
With eager, almost breathless, excitement we stood watching the
preparations, at the same time using every means in our power to
attract the attention of the sharks.

This is an atom: 
As soon as the whirl was ready the
boatswain began to think about bait; and, talking rapidly to himself,
ransacked every corner of the raft, as though he expected to find some
dead body coming opportunely to sight.

This is an atom: 
But his search ended in nothing;
and the only plan that suggested itself was again to have recourse to
Miss Herbey's red shawl, of which a fragment was wrapped round the
head of the hammer.

This is an atom: 
After testing the strength of his line, and
reassuring-himself that it was fastened firmly both to the hammer and to
the raft, the boatswain lowered it into the water.

This is an atom: 
The sea was quite transparent, and any object was clearly visible to
a depth of two hundred feet below the surface.

This is an atom: 
Leaning over the low
parapet of the raft we looked on in breathless silence, as the scarlet
rag, distinct as it was against the blue mass of water, made its slow
descent.

This is an atom: 
But one by one the sharks seemed to disappear, They could not,
however, have gone far away, and it was not likely that anything in the
shape of bait dropped near them would long escape their keen voracity.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly, without speaking, the boatswain raised his hand and pointed to
a dark mass skimming along the surface of the water, and making straight
in our direction.

This is an atom: 
It was a shark, certainly not less than twelve feet
long.

This is an atom: 
As soon as the creature was about four fathoms from the raft, the
boatswain gently drew in his line until the whirl was in such a position
that the shark must cross right over it; at the same time he shook the
line a little, that he might give the whirl the appearance, if he could,
of being something alive and moving.

This is an atom: 
As the creature came near, my heart
beat violently; I could see its eyes flashing above the waves; and its
gaping jaws, as it turned half over on its back, exhibited long rows of
pointed teeth.

This is an atom: 
I know not who it was, but some one at that moment uttered an
involuntary cry of horror.

This is an atom: 
The shark came to a standstill, turned about,
and escaped quite out of sight.

This is an atom: 
"The first man who speaks," he said, "I will kill him on the spot.

This is an atom: 
The whirl again was lowered, this
time to the depth of twenty fathoms, but for half an hour or more not a
shark could be distinguished; but as the waters far below seemed somehow
to be troubled I could not help believing that some of the brutes at
least were still there.

This is an atom: 
All at once, with a violent jerk, the cord was wrested from the
boatswain's hands; firmly attached, however, as it was to the raft, it
was not lost.

This is an atom: 
The bait had been seized by a shark, and the iron had made
good its hold upon the creature's flesh.

This is an atom: 
"

Passengers and sailors, one and all, put forth what strength they had
to drag the rope, but so violent were the creature's struggles that
it required all our efforts (and it is needless to say that they were
willing enough) to bring it to the surface, At length, after exertions
that almost exhausted us, the water became agitated by the violent
flappings of the tail and fins; and looking down I saw the huge carcase
of the shark writhing convulsively amidst waves that were stained with
blood.

This is an atom: 
" said the boatswain, as the head appeared above.

This is an atom: 
The whirl had passed right through the jaw into the middle of the
throat; so that no struggle on the part of the animal could possibly
release it.

This is an atom: 
Dowlas seized his hatchet, ready to despatch the brute the
moment if should be landed on the raft.

This is an atom: 
The shark had closed its jaws, and bitten through the wooden handle of
the hammer.

This is an atom: 
Another moment and it had turned round and was completely
gone.

This is an atom: 
All the labour and the
patience, all had been in vain.

This is an atom: 
Dowlas made a few more unsuccessful
attempts, but as the whirl was lost, and they had no means of replacing
it, there was no further room for hope.

This is an atom: 
They did, indeed, lower some
cords twisted into running knots, but (as might have been expected)
these only slipped over, without holding, the slimy bodies of the
sharks.

This is an atom: 
As a last resource the boatswain allowed his naked leg to
hang over the side of the raft; the monsters, however, were proof even
against this attraction.

This is an atom: 
Reduced once again to a gloomy despondency, all turned to their places,
to await the end that cannot now be long deferred.

This is an atom: 
Just as I moved away I heard the boatswain say to Curtis,--

"Captain, when shall we draw lots?

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 16th.--If the crew of any passing vessel had caught sight of us
as we lay still and inanimate upon our sail-cloth, they would scarcely,
at first sight, have hesitated to pronounce us dead.

This is an atom: 
My sufferings were terrible; tongue, lips, and throat were so parched
and swollen that if food had been at hand I question whether I could
have swallowed it.

This is an atom: 
So exasperated were the feelings of us all, however,
that we glanced at each other with looks as savage as though we were
about to slaughter and without delay eat up one another.

This is an atom: 
The heat was aggravated by the atmosphere being somewhat stormy.

This is an atom: 
Heavy
vapours gathered on the horizon, and there was a look as if it were
raining all around.

This is an atom: 
Longing eyes and gasping mouths turned involuntarily
towards the clouds, and M. Letourneur, on bended knee, was raising his
hands, as it might be in supplication to the relentless skies.

This is an atom: 
It was eleven o'clock in the morning.

This is an atom: 
I listened for distant rumblings
which might announce an approaching storm, but although the vapours had
obstructed the sun's rays, they no longer presented the appearance
of being charged with electricity.

This is an atom: 
Thus our prognostications ended in
disappointment; the clouds, which in the early morning had been marked
by the distinctness of their outline, had melted one into another and
assumed an uniform dull grey tint; in fact, we were enveloped in an
ordinary fog.

This is an atom: 
But was it not still possible that this fog might turn to
rain?

This is an atom: 
Happily this hope was destined to be realized; for in a very short time,
Dowlas, with a shout of delight, declared that rain was actually coming;
and sure enough, not half a mile from the raft, the dark parallel
streaks against the sky testified that there at least the rain was
falling.

This is an atom: 
I fancied I could see the drops rebounding from the surface of
the water.

This is an atom: 
The wind was fresh and bringing the cloud right on towards
us, yet we could not suppress our trepidation lest it; should exhaust
itself before it reached us.

This is an atom: 
But no: very soon large heavy drops began to fall, and the storm-cloud,
passing over our heads, was outpouring its contents upon us.

This is an atom: 
The shower,
however, was very transient; already a bright streak of light along
the horizon marked the limit of the cloud and warned us that we must be
quick to make the most of what it had to give us.

This is an atom: 
Curtis had placed the
broken barrel in the position that was most exposed, and every sail was
spread out to the fullest extent our dimensions would allow.

This is an atom: 
We all laid ourselves down flat upon our backs and kept our mouths wide
open.

This is an atom: 
The rain splashed into my face, wetted my lips, and trickled down
my throat.

This is an atom: 
Never can I describe the ecstasy with which I imbibed that
renovating moisture.

This is an atom: 
The parched and swollen glands relaxed, I breathed
afresh, and my whole being seemed revived with a strange and requickened
life.

This is an atom: 
The rain lasted about twenty minutes, when the cloud, still only half
exhausted, passed quite away from over us.

This is an atom: 
We grasped each other's hands as we rose from the platform on which
we had been lying, and mutual congratulations, mingled with gratitude,
poured forth from our long silent lips.

This is an atom: 
Hope, however evanescent it
might be, for the moment had returned, and we yielded to the expectation
that, ere long, other and more abundant clouds might come and replenish
our store.

This is an atom: 
The next consideration was how to preserve and economize what little had
been collected by the barrel, or imbibed by the outspread sails.

This is an atom: 
It was
found that only a few pints of rain-water had fallen into the barrel
to this small quantity the sailors were about to add what they could
by wringing out the saturated sails, when Curtis made them desist from
their intention.

This is an atom: 
" he said, "we must wait a moment; we must see whether this
water from the sails is drinkable.

This is an atom: 
Why should not this be as drinkable as the
other?

This is an atom: 
He squeezed a few drops out of one of the folds of a sail into
the tin pot, and put it to his lips.

This is an atom: 
To my surprise, he rejected it
immediately, and upon tasting it for myself I found it not merely
brackish, but briny as the sea itself.

This is an atom: 
The fact was that the canvas
had been so long exposed to the action of the waves, that it had become
thoroughly impregnated by salt, which of course was taken up again by
the water that fell upon it.

This is an atom: 
Disappointed we were; but with several
pints of water in our possession, we were not only contented for the
present, but sanguine in our prospect for the future.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 17th.--As a natural consequence of the alleviation of our
thirst, the pangs of hunger returned more violently than ever.

This is an atom: 
Although
we had no bait, and even if we had we could not use it for want of
a whirl, we could not help asking whether no possible means could
be devised for securing one out of the many sharks that were still
perpetually swarming about the raft.

This is an atom: 
Armed with knives, like the Indians
in the pearl fisheries, was it not practicable to attack the monsters in
their own element?

This is an atom: 
Curtis expressed his willingness personally to make
the attempt, but so numerous were the sharks that we would not for one
moment hear of his risking his life in a venture of which the danger was
as great as the success was doubtful.

This is an atom: 
By plunging into the sea, or by gnawing at a piece of metal, we could
always, or at least often, do something that cheated us into believing
that we were mitigating the pains of thirst; but with hunger it was
different.

This is an atom: 
The prospect, too, of rain seemed hopeful, whilst for getting
food there appeared no chance; and, as we knew that nothing could
compensate for the lack of nutritive matter, we were soon all cast down
again.

This is an atom: 
Shocking to confess, it would be untrue to deny that we surveyed
each other with the eye of an eager longing; and I need hardly explain
to what a degree of savageness the one idea that haunted us had reduced
our feelings.

This is an atom: 
Ever since the storm-cloud brought us the too transient shower the
sky has been tolerably clear, and although at that time the wind had
slightly freshened, it has since dropped, and the sail hangs idly
against our mast.

This is an atom: 
Except for the trifling relief it brings by modifying
the temperature we care little now for any breeze.

This is an atom: 
Ignorant as we are as
to what quarter of the Atlantic we have been carried by the currents, it
matters very little to us from what direction the wind may blow if
only it would bring, in rain or dew, the moisture of which we are so
dreadfully in need.

This is an atom: 
The moon was entering her last quarter, so that it was dark till nearly
midnight, and the stars were misty, not glowing with that lustre which
is so often characteristic of cool nights.

This is an atom: 
Half frantic with that sense
of hunger which invariably returns with redoubled vigour at the close of
every day, I threw myself, in a kind of frenzy, upon a bundle of sails
that was lying on the starboard of the raft, and leaning over, I tried
to get some measure of relief by inhaling the moist coolness that rarely
fails to circulate just above the water.

This is an atom: 
My brain was haunted by the
most horrible nightmares; not that I suppose I was in any way more
distressed than my companions, who were lying in their usual places,
vainly endeavouring to forget their sufferings in sleep.

This is an atom: 
How long I remained in that state of stupor I could hardly
say, but at length a strange sensation half brought me to myself.

This is an atom: 
Was
I dreaming, or was there not really some unaccustomed odour floating in
the air?

This is an atom: 
My nostrils became distended, and I could scarcely suppress a
cry of astonishment; but some instinct kept me quiet, and I laid myself
down again with the puzzled sensation sometimes experienced when we
have forgotten a word or name.

This is an atom: 
Only a few minutes, however, had elapsed
before another still more savoury puff induced me to take several
long inhalations.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly, the truth seemed to dash across my mind.

This is an atom: 
"Surely," I muttered to myself "this must be cooked meat that I can
smell.

This is an atom: 
"

Again and again I sniffed and became more convinced than ever that my
senses were not deceiving me.

This is an atom: 
But from what part of the raft could the
smell proceed?

This is an atom: 
I rose to my knees, and having satisfied myself that the
odour came from the front, I crept stealthily as a cat under the sails
and between the spars in that direction.

This is an atom: 
Following the promptings of
my scent, rather than my vision, like a bloodhound in the track of his
prey, I searched everywhere I could, now finding, now losing, the smell
according to my change of position, or the dropping of the wind.

This is an atom: 
At
length I got the true scent; once for all, so that I could go straight
to the object for which I was in search.

This is an atom: 
Approaching the starboard angle of the raft, I came to the conclusion
that the smell that had thus keenly excited my cravings was the smell
of smoked bacon; the membranes of my tongue almost bristled with the
intenseness of my longing.

This is an atom: 
Crawling along a little farther, under a thick roll of sail-cloth, I was
not long in securing my prize.

This is an atom: 
Forcing my arm below the roll, I felt my
hand in contact with something wrapped up in paper.

This is an atom: 
I clutched it up,
and carried it off to a place where I could examine it by the help
of the light of the moon that had now made its appearance above the
horizon.

This is an atom: 
True,
it did not weigh many ounces, but small as it was it would suffice to
alleviate the pangs of hunger for one day at least.

This is an atom: 
I was just on the
point of raising it to my mouth, when a hand was laid upon my arm.

This is an atom: 
It
was only by a most determined effort that I kept myself from screaming
out one instant more, and I found myself face to face with Hobart.

This is an atom: 
Plainly this rascal Hobart had saved some
provision from the wreck, upon which he had been subsisting ever since.

This is an atom: 
The steward had provided for himself, whilst all around him were dying
of starvation.

This is an atom: 
Yet why, it struck me, should I complain?

This is an atom: 
Was not I reaping the benefit
of that secret store that he, for himself, had saved?

This is an atom: 
But Hobart had no idea of allowing me the peaceable possession of what
he held to be his own.

This is an atom: 
He made a dash at the fragment of bacon, and
seemed determined to wrest it from my grasp.

This is an atom: 
We struggled with each
other, but although our wrestling was very violent, it was very
noiseless.

This is an atom: 
We were both of us aware that it was absolutely necessary
that not one of those on board should know anything at all about
the prize for which we were contending.

This is an atom: 
Nor was my own determination
lessened by hearing him groan out that it was his last, his only morsel.

This is an atom: 
" I thought; "it shall be mine now!

This is an atom: 
"

And still careful that no noise of commotion should arise, I threw him
on his back, and grasping his throat so that it gurgled again, I held
him down until, in rapid mouthfuls, I had swallowed up the last scrap of
the food for which we had fought so hard.

This is an atom: 
I released my prisoner, and quietly crept back to my own quarters.

This is an atom: 
And not a soul is aware that I have broken my fast!

This is an atom: 
My conscience told me that Hobart had the right to
denounce me in the presence of all my fellow-passengers; yet my alarm
was vain.

This is an atom: 
The idea of my proceedings being exposed by him was quite
absurd; in a moment he would himself be murdered without pity by the
crew, if it should be revealed that, unknown to them, he had been living
on some private store which, by clandestine cunning, he had reserved.

This is an atom: 
The bit of food that I had thus stolen was very small; but small as it
was it had alleviated my hunger, and I was now tortured with remorse,
because I had not shared the meagre morsel with my fellow-sufferers.

This is an atom: 
Miss Herbey, Andre, his father, all had been forgotten, and from the
bottom of my heart I repented of my cruel selfishness.

This is an atom: 
There is no twilight in these low latitudes, and the
full daylight came well nigh at once.

This is an atom: 
I had not closed my eyes since my
encounter with the steward, and ever since the first blush of day I had
laboured under the impression that I could see some unusual dark mass
half way up the mast.

This is an atom: 
But although it again and again caught my eye, it
hardly roused my curiosity, and I did not rise from the bundle of sails
on which I was lying to ascertain what it really was.

This is an atom: 
But no sooner did
the rays of the sun fall full upon it than I saw at once that it was
the body of a man, attached to a rope, and swinging to and fro with the
motion of the raft.

This is an atom: 
A horrible presentiment carried me to the foot of the mast, and, just
as I had guessed, Hobart had hanged himself.

This is an atom: 
I could not for a moment;
doubt that it was I myself that had impelled him to the suicide.

This is an atom: 
A cry
of horror had scarcely escaped my lips, when my fellow-passengers were
at my side, and the rope was cut.

This is an atom: 
And what was it
that made the group gather so eagerly around the body?

This is an atom: 
Was it a humane
desire to see whether any spark of life remained?

This is an atom: 
No, indeed; the corpse
was cold, and the limbs were rigid; there was no chance that animation
should be restored.

This is an atom: 
What then was it that kept them lingering so close
around?

This is an atom: 
It was only too apparent what they were about to do.

This is an atom: 
I refused to take part in the horrible
repast that was proposed.

This is an atom: 
I know nothing for certain as to what Curtis did, and I did not
venture to inquire; but of the others,--Falsten, Dowlas, the boatswain,
and all the rest,--I know that, to assuage their cravings, they
consented to reduce themselves to the level of beasts of prey; they were
transformed from human beings into ravenous brutes.

This is an atom: 
The four of us who sickened at the idea of partaking of the horrid
meal withdrew to the seclusion of our tent; it was bad enough to hear;
without witnessing the appalling operation.

This is an atom: 
But, in truth, I had the
greatest difficulty in the world in preventing Andre from rushing out
upon the cannibals, and snatching the odious food from their clutches.

This is an atom: 
I represented to him the hopelessness of his attempt, and tried to
reconcile him by telling him that if they liked the food they had a
right to it.

This is an atom: 
Hobart had not been murdered; he had died by his own hand;
and, after all, as the boatswain had once remarked to me, "it was better
to eat a dead man than a live one.

This is an atom: 
"

Do what I would, however, I could not quiet Andre's feeling of
abhorrence; in his disgust and loathing he seemed for the time to have
quite forgotten his own sufferings.

This is an atom: 
Meanwhile, there was no concealing the truth that we were ourselves
dying of starvation, whilst our eight companions would probably, by
their loathsome diet, escape that frightful destiny.

This is an atom: 
Owing to his secret
hoard of provisions Hobart had been by far the strongest amongst us; he
had been supported, so that no organic disease had affected his tissues,
and really might be said to be in good health when his chagrin drove him
to his desperate suicide.

This is an atom: 
But what was I thinking of!

This is an atom: 
whither were
my meditations carrying me away?

This is an atom: 
was it not coming to pass that the
cannibals were rousing my envy instead of exciting my horror?

This is an atom: 
Very shortly after this I heard Dowlas talking about the possibility
of obtaining salt by evaporating sea-water in the sun; "and then," he
added, "we can salt down the rest.

This is an atom: 
"

The boatswain assented to what the carpenter had said, and probably the
suggestion was adopted.

This is an atom: 
I presume that
nearly all have gone to sleep.

This is an atom: 
One thing I do know, that they are no
longer hungry!

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 19th.--All through the day the sky remained unclouded and
the heat intense; and night came on without bringing much sensible
moderation in the temperature.

This is an atom: 
I was unable to get any sleep, and,
towards morning, was disturbed by hearing an angry clamour going on
outside the tent; it aroused M. Letourneur, Andre and Miss Herbey,
as much as myself, and we were anxious to ascertain the cause of the
tumult.

This is an atom: 
The boatswain, Dowlas, and all the sailors were storming at each other
in frightful rage; and Curtis, who had come forward from the stern, was
vainly endeavouring to pacify them.

This is an atom: 
"But who has done it?

This is an atom: 
we must know who has done it," said Dowlas,
scowling with vindictive passion on the group around him.

This is an atom: 
"There's a thief," howled out the boatswain, "and he shall be found!

This is an atom: 
Let's know who has taken it.

This is an atom: 
"

"I haven't taken it!

This is an atom: 
And then they set to work again to ransack every quarter of the raft;
they rolled every spar aside, they overturned everything on board,
and only grew more and more incensed with anger as their search proved
fruitless.

This is an atom: 
"Can YOU tell us," said the boatswain, coming up to me, "who is the
thief?

This is an atom: 
"I don't know what you mean.

This is an atom: 
"

And while we were speaking the others all came up together, and told me
that they had looked everywhere else, and that they were going now to
search the tent.

This is an atom: 
"You ought to allow those whom you know to be dying of
hunger at least to die in peace.

This is an atom: 
There is not one of us who has left the
tent all night.

This is an atom: 
Why suspect us?

This is an atom: 
Kazallon," said the boatswain, in a voice which
he was endeavouring to calm down into moderation, "we are not accusing
you of anything; we know well enough you, and all the rest of you, had
a right to your shares as much as anybody; but that isn't it.

This is an atom: 
"

"Yes," said Sandon gruffly; "it's all gone somewheres, and we are a
going to search the tent.

This is an atom: 
"

Resistance was useless, and Miss Herbey, M. Letourneur, and Andre were
all turned out.

This is an atom: 
I confess I was very fearful.

This is an atom: 
I had a strong suspicion that for the sake
of his son, for whom he was ready to venture anything, M. Letourneur
had committed the theft; in that case I knew that nothing would have
prevented the infuriated men from tearing the devoted father to pieces.

This is an atom: 
I beckoned to Curtis for protection, and he came and stood beside me.

This is an atom: 
He
said nothing, but waited with his hands in his pockets, and I think I am
not mistaken in my belief that there was some sort of a weapon in each.

This is an atom: 
There was no doubt that
the carcase of the suicide had been thrown overboard, and the rage of
the disappointed cannibals knew no bounds.

This is an atom: 
Yet who had ventured to do the deed!

This is an atom: 
I looked at M. Letourneur and Miss
Herbey; but their countenances at once betrayed their ignorance.

This is an atom: 
Andre
turned his face away, and his eyes did not meet my own.

This is an atom: 
Probably it is
he; but, if it be, I wonder whether he has reckoned up the consequences
of so rash an act.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 20th to 22nd.--For the day or two after the horrible repast of
the 18th those who had partaken of it appeared to suffer comparatively
little either from hunger or thirst; but for the four of us who had
tasted nothing, the agony of suffering grew more and more intense.

This is an atom: 
It
was enough to make us repine over the loss of the provision that had so
mysteriously gone; and if any one of us should die, I doubt whether the
survivors would a second time resist the temptation to assuage their
pangs by tasting human flesh.

This is an atom: 
Before long, all the cravings of hunger began to return to the sailors,
and I could see their eyes greedily glancing upon us, starved as they
knew us to be, as though they were reckoning our hours, and already were
preparing to consume us as their prey.

This is an atom: 
As is always the case with shipwrecked men, we were tormented by thirst
far more than by hunger; and if, in the height of our sufferings, we had
been offered our choice between a few drops of water and a few crumbs
of biscuit, I do not doubt that we should, without exception, have
preferred to take the water.

This is an atom: 
And what a mockery to our condition did it seem that all this while
there was water, water, nothing but water, everywhere around us!

This is an atom: 
Again
and again, incapable of comprehending how powerless it was to relieve
me, I put a few drops within my lips, but only with the invariable
result of bringing on a most trying nausea, and rendering my thirst more
unendurable than before.

This is an atom: 
Forty-two days had passed since we quitted the sinking "Chancellor.

This is an atom: 
"
There could be no hope now; all of us must die, and by the most
deplorable of deaths.

This is an atom: 
I was quite conscious that a mist was gathering
over my brain; I felt my senses sinking into a condition of torpor; I
made an effort, but all in vain, to master the delirium that I was aware
was taking possession of my reason.

This is an atom: 
It is out of my power to decide for
how long I lost my consciousness; but when I came to myself I found
that Miss Herbey had folded some wet bandages around my forehead.

This is an atom: 
I am
somewhat better; but I am weakened, mind and body, and I am conscious
that I have not long to live.

This is an atom: 
Jynxstrop
the negro went raving mad.

This is an atom: 
Curtis and several of the men tried their
utmost to control him, but in spite of everything he broke loose,
and tore up and down the raft, uttering fearful yells.

This is an atom: 
He had gained
possession of a handspike, and rushed upon us all with the ferocity
of an infuriated tiger; how we contrived to escape mischief from his
attacks, I know not.

This is an atom: 
With his teeth and nails he
gnawed and tore away at his own flesh; dashing the blood into our faces,
he shrieked out with a demoniacal grin, "Drink, drink!

This is an atom: 
" and flinging us
gory morsels, kept saying "Eat, eat!

This is an atom: 
" In the midst of his insane shrieks
he made a sudden pause, then dashing back again from the stern to the
front, he made a bound and disappeared beneath the waves.

This is an atom: 
Falsten, Dowlas, and the boatswain, made a rush that at least they might
secure the body; but it was too late; all that they could see was a
crimson circle in the water, and some huge sharks disporting themselves
around the spot.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER L.

JANUARY 23rd.--Only eleven of us now remain; and the probability is very
great that every day must now carry off at least its one victim, and
perhaps more.

This is an atom: 
The end of the tragedy is rapidly approaching, and save
for the chance, which is next to an impossibility, of our sighting land,
or being picked up by a passing vessel, ere another week has elapsed not
a single survivor of the "Chancellor" will remain.

This is an atom: 
The wind freshened considerably in the night, and it is now blowing
pretty briskly from the north-east.

This is an atom: 
It has filled our sail, and
the white foam in our wake is an indication that we are making some
progress.

This is an atom: 
The captain reckons that we must be advancing at the rate of
about three miles an hour.

This is an atom: 
Curtis and Falsten are certainly in the best condition amongst us, and
in spite of their extreme emaciation they bear up wonderfully under
the protracted hardships we have all endured.

This is an atom: 
Words cannot describe the
melancholy state to which poor Miss Herbey bodily is reduced; her whole
being seems absorbed into her soul, but that soul is brave and resolute
as ever, living in heaven rather than on earth.

This is an atom: 
The boatswain, strong,
energetic man that he was, has shrunk into a mere shadow of his former
self, and I doubt whether any one would recognize him to be the same
man.

This is an atom: 
He keeps perpetually to one corner of the raft, his head dropped
upon his chest, and his long, bony hands lying upon knees that project
sharply from his worn-out trowsers.

This is an atom: 
Unlike Miss Herbey, his spirit seems
to have sunk into apathy, and it is at times difficult to believe that
he is living at all, so motionless and statue-like does he sit.

This is an atom: 
Silence continues to reign upon the raft.

This is an atom: 
We do not exchange ten words in the course of the
day, and the few syllables that our parched tongue and swollen lips can
pronounce are almost unintelligible.

This is an atom: 
Wasted and bloodless, we are no
longer human beings; we are spectres.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 24th.--I have inquired more than once of Curtis if he has the
faintest idea to what quarter of the Atlantic we have drifted, and each
time he has been unable to give me a decided answer, though from
his general observation of the direction of the wind and currents he
imagines that we have been carried westwards, that is to say, towards
the land.

This is an atom: 
To-day the breeze has dropped entirely, but the heavy swell is still
upon the sea, and is an unquestionable sign that a tempest has been
raging at no great distance.

This is an atom: 
The raft labours hard against the waves,
and Curtis, Falsten, and the boatswain, employ the little energy that
remains to them in strengthening the joints.

This is an atom: 
Why do they give themselves
such trouble?

This is an atom: 
Why not let the few frail planks part asunder, and allow
the ocean to terminate our miserable existence?

This is an atom: 
Certain it seems that
our sufferings must have reached their utmost limit, and nothing could
exceed the torture that we are enduring.

This is an atom: 
The sky pours down upon us a
heat like that of molten lead, and the sweat that saturates the tattered
clothes that hang about our bodies goes far to aggravate the agonies
of our thirst.

This is an atom: 
Even bathing, the only means of refreshment that we possessed, has now
become impossible, for ever since Jynxstrop's death the sharks have hung
about the raft in shoals.

This is an atom: 
To-day I tried to gain a few drops of fresh water by evaporation, but
even with the exercise of the greatest patience, it was with the utmost
difficulty that I obtained enough to moisten a little scrap of linen;
and the only kettle that we had was so old and battered, that it would
not bear the fire, so that I was obliged to give up the attempt in
despair.

This is an atom: 
Falsten is now almost exhausted, and if he survives us at all, it can
only be for a few days.

This is an atom: 
Whenever I raised my head I always failed to see
him, but he was probably lying sheltered somewhere beneath the sails.

This is an atom: 
Curtis was the only man who remained on his feet, but with indomitable
pluck he continued to stand on the front of the raft, waiting, watching,
hoping.

This is an atom: 
To look at him, with his unflagging energy, almost tempted me to
imagine that he did well to hope, but I dared nor entertain one sanguine
thought; and there I lay, waiting, nay, longing for death.

This is an atom: 
How many hours passed away thus I cannot tell, but after a time a loud
peal of laughter burst upon my ear Some one else, then, was going mad,
I thought; but the idea did not rouse me in the least.

This is an atom: 
The laughter was
repeated with greater vehemence, but I never raised my head.

This is an atom: 
I thought again; the wealth of a nation could not
buy a drop of water here.

This is an atom: 
There was silence for a minute, when all of a
sudden I heard the shout of "Land!

This is an atom: 
"

The words acted upon me like an electric shock, and, with a frantic
effort, I started to my feet.

This is an atom: 
No land, indeed, was visible, but
Flaypole, laughing, singing, and gesticulating, was raging up and down
the raft.

This is an atom: 
Sight, taste and hearing--all were gone; but the cerebral
derangement supplied their place, and in imagination the maniac was
conversing with absent friends, inviting them into the George Inn at
Cardiff, offering them gin, whisky, and, above all water!

This is an atom: 
Stumbling at
every step, and singing in a cracked, discordant voice, he staggered
about amongst us like an intoxicated man.

This is an atom: 
With the loss of his senses
all his sufferings had vanished, and his thirst was appeased.

This is an atom: 
It was
hard not to wish to be a partaker of his hallucination.

This is an atom: 
Dowlas, Falsten, and the boatswain, seemed to think that the unfortunate
wretch would, like Jynxstrop, put an end to himself by leaping into the
sea; but, determined this time to preserve the body, that it might serve
a better purpose than merely feeding the sharks, they rose and followed
the madman everywhere he went, keeping a strict eye upon his every
movement.

This is an atom: 
But the matter did not end as they expected.

This is an atom: 
As though he were really
intoxicated by the stimulants of which he had been raving, Flaypole at
last sank down in a heap in a corner of the raft, where he lay lost in a
heavy slumber.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 25th.--Last night was very misty, and for some unaccountable
reason, one of the hottest that can be imagined.

This is an atom: 
The atmosphere was
really so stifling, that it seemed as if it only required a spark to set
it alight.

This is an atom: 
The raft was not only quite stationary, but did not even rise
and fall with any motion of the waves.

This is an atom: 
During the night I tried to count how many there were now on board,
but I was utterly unable to collect my ideas sufficiently to make the
enumeration.

This is an atom: 
Sometimes I counted ten, sometimes twelve, and although
I knew that eleven, since Jynxstrop was dead, was the correct number, I
could never bring my reckoning right.

This is an atom: 
Of one thing I felt quite sure,
and that was that the number would very soon be ten.

This is an atom: 
I was convinced
that I could myself last but very little longer.

This is an atom: 
All the events and
associations of my life passed rapidly through my brain, My country, my
friends, and my family all appeared as it were in a vision, and seemed
as though they had come to bid me a last farewell.

This is an atom: 
Towards morning I woke from my sleep, if the languid stupour into
which I had fallen was worthy of that name.

This is an atom: 
One fixed idea had taken
possession of my brain; I would put an end to myself, and I felt a
sort of pleasure as I gloated over the power that I had to terminate my
sufferings.

This is an atom: 
I told Curtis, with the utmost composure, of my intention,
and he received the intelligence as calmly as it was delivered.

This is an atom: 
"Of course you will do as you please," he said; "for, my own part, I
shall not abandon my post.

This is an atom: 
It is my duty to remain here, and unless
death comes to carry me away, I shall stay where I am to the very last.

This is an atom: 
"

The dull grey fog still hung heavily over the ocean, but the sun was
evidently shining above the mist, and would, in course of time, dispel
the vapour.

This is an atom: 
Towards seven o'clock I fancied I heard the cries of birds
above my head.

This is an atom: 
The sound was repeated three times, and as I went up to
the captain to ask him about it, I heard him mutter to himself,--

"Birds!

This is an atom: 
why, that looks as if land were not far off.

This is an atom: 
"

But although Curtis might still cling to the hope of reaching land,
I knew not what it was to have one sanguine thought.

This is an atom: 
For me there was
neither continent nor island; the world was one fluid sphere,
uniform, monotonous, as in the most primitive period of its formation.

This is an atom: 
Nevertheless it must be owned that it was with a certain amount of
impatience that I awaited the rising of the mist, for I was anxious to
shake off the phantom fallacies that Curtis's words had suggested to my
mind.

This is an atom: 
Not till eleven o'clock did the fog begin to break, and as it rolled in
heavy folds along the surface of the water, I could every now and then
catch glimpses of a clear blue sky beyond.

This is an atom: 
Fierce sunbeams pierced the
cloud-rifts, scorching and burning our bodies like red-hot iron; but
it was only above our heads that there was any sunlight to condense the
vapour; the horizon was still quite invisible.

This is an atom: 
There was no wind, and
for half an hour longer the fog hung heavily round the raft; whilst
Curtis, leaning against the side, strove to penetrate the obscurity.

This is an atom: 
At
length the sun burst forth in full power, and, sweeping the surface of
the ocean, dispelled the fog, and left the horizon opened to our eyes.

This is an atom: 
There, exactly as we had seen it for the last six weeks, was the circle
that bounded sea and sky, unbroken, definite, distinct as ever!

This is an atom: 
Curtis
gazed with intensest scrutiny, but did not speak a word.

This is an atom: 
I pitied him
sincerely, for he alone of us all felt that he had not the right to put
an end to his misery.

This is an atom: 
For myself I had fully determined that if I
lived till the following day, I would die by my own hand.

This is an atom: 
Whether my
companions were still alive, I hardly cared to know; it seemed as though
days had passed since I had seen them.

This is an atom: 
Night drew on, but I could not sleep for a moment.

This is an atom: 
Towards two o'clock
in the morning my thirst was so intense that I was unable to suppress
loud cries of agony.

This is an atom: 
Was there nothing that would serve to quench the
fire that was burning within me?

This is an atom: 
What if instead of drinking the blood
of others I were to drink my own?

This is an atom: 
It would be all unavailing, I was well
aware, but scarcely had the thought crossed my mind, than I proceeded to
put it into execution.

This is an atom: 
I unclasped my knife, and, stripping my arm, with
a steady thrust I opened a small vein.

This is an atom: 
The blood oozed out slowly, drop
by drop, and as I eagerly swallowed the source of my very life, I felt
that for a moment my torments were relieved, But only for a moment; all
energy had failed my pulses, and almost immediately the blood had ceased
to flow.

This is an atom: 
How long it seemed before the morning dawned!

This is an atom: 
and when that morning came
it brought another fog, heavy as before that again shut out the horizon.

This is an atom: 
The fog was hot as the burning steam that issues from a boiler.

This is an atom: 
It was
to be my last day upon earth, and I felt that I would like to press the
hand of a friend before I died.

This is an atom: 
Curtis was standing near, and crawling
up to him, I took his hand in my own.

This is an atom: 
He seemed to know that I was
taking my farewell, and with one last lingering hope he endeavoured to
restrain me.

This is an atom: 
But all in vain, my mind was finally made up.

This is an atom: 
I should have like to speak once again to M. Letourneur, Andre and Miss
Herbey, but my courage failed me.

This is an atom: 
I knew that the young girl would read
my resolution in my eyes, and that she would speak to me of duty and of
God, and of eternity, and I dared not meet her gaze; and I would not
run the risk of being persuaded to wait until a lingering death should
overtake me.

This is an atom: 
I returned to the back of the raft, and after making
several efforts, I managed to get on to my feet.

This is an atom: 
I cast one long look at
the pitiless ocean and the unbroken horizon; if a sail or the outline of
a coast bad broken on my view, I believe that I should only have deemed
myself the victim of an illusion; but nothing of the kind appeared, and
the sea was dreary as a desert.

This is an atom: 
It was ten o'clock in the morning.

This is an atom: 
The pangs of hunger and the torments
of thirst were racking me with redoubled vigour.

This is an atom: 
All instinct of
self-preservation had left me, and I felt that the hour had come when
I must cease to suffer.

This is an atom: 
Just as I was on the point of casting myself
headlong into the sea, a voice, which I recognized as Dowlas's; broke
upon my ear.

This is an atom: 
"Captain," he said, "we are going to draw lots.

This is an atom: 
"

Involuntarily I paused; I did not take my plunge, but returned to my
place upon the raft.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 26th.--All heard and understood the proposition; in fact, it had
been in contemplation for several days, but no one had ventured to put
the idea into words.

This is an atom: 
However, it was done now; lots were to be drawn,
and to each would be assigned his share of the body of the one ordained
by fate to be the victim.

This is an atom: 
For my own part, I profess that I was quite
resigned for the lot to fall upon myself.

This is an atom: 
I thought I heard Andre
Letourneur beg for an exception to be made in favour of Miss Herbey, but
the sailors raised a murmur of dissent.

This is an atom: 
As there were eleven of us on
board, there were ten chances to one in each one's favour, a proportion
which would be diminished if Miss Herbey were excluded, so that the
young lady was forced to take her chance among the rest.

This is an atom: 
It was then half-past ten, and the boatswain, who had been roused from
his lethargy by what the carpenter had said, insisted that the drawing
should take place immediately.

This is an atom: 
There was not one of us that clung in the least to life,
and we knew that at the worst, whoever should be doomed to die, would
only precede the rest by a few days, or even hours.

This is an atom: 
All that we desired
was just once to slake our raging thirst and moderate our gnawing
hunger.

This is an atom: 
How all the names found their way to the bottom of a hat I cannot
tell.

This is an atom: 
But be that as it may, the eleven names were there, and
it was unanimously agreed that the last name drawn should be the victim.

This is an atom: 
But who would draw the names?

This is an atom: 
There was hesitation for a moment; then,
"I will," said a voice behind me.

This is an atom: 
Turning round, I beheld M. Letourneur
standing with outstretched hand, and with his long white hair falling
over his thin livid face that was almost sublime in its calmness.

This is an atom: 
I
divined at once the reason of this voluntary offer; I knew that it was
the father's devotion in self-sacrifice that led him to undertake the
office.

This is an atom: 
"As soon as you please," said the boatswain, and handed him the hat.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur proceeded to draw out the folded strips of paper one by
one, and after reading out aloud the name upon it, handed it to its
owner.

This is an atom: 
The first name called was that of Burke, who uttered a cry of delight;
then followed Flaypole and the boatswain.

This is an atom: 
What his name really was I
never could exactly learn.

This is an atom: 
More
than half had now been called, and my name had not yet been drawn.

This is an atom: 
I
calculated my remaining chance; it was still four to one in my favour.

This is an atom: 
Since Burke's first
exclamation of joy not a sound had escaped our lips, but all were
listening in breathless silence.

This is an atom: 
Then came mine, yes, mine!

This is an atom: 
and
the ninth was that of Letourneur.

This is an atom: 
"Go on," almost roared the carpenter, surveying his partner in peril as
though he could devour him.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur almost had a smile upon
his lips, as he drew forth the last paper but one, and with a firm,
unfaltering voice, marvelous for his age, unfolded it slowly, and read
the name of Dowlas.

This is an atom: 
The carpenter gave a yell of relief as he heard the
word.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur took the last bit of paper from the hat, and without
looking at it, tore it to pieces.

This is an atom: 
I crawled towards it
and picked it up.

This is an atom: 
On one side of it was written Andr--; the rest of
the word was torn away.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur saw what I had done, and rushing
towards me, snatched the paper from my hands, and flung it into the sea.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 26th.--I understood it all; the devoted father having nothing
more to give, had given his life for his son.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur was no longer a human being in the eyes of the famished
creatures who were now yearning to see him sacrificed to their cravings.

This is an atom: 
At the very sight of the victim thus provided, all the tortures of
hunger returned with redoubled violence.

This is an atom: 
With lips distended, and teeth
displayed, they waited like a herd of carnivora until they could attack
their prey with brutal voracity; it seemed almost doubtful whether they
would not fall upon him while he was still alive.

This is an atom: 
It seemed impossible
that any appeal to their humanity could, at such a moment, have any
weight; nevertheless, the appeal was made, and, incredible as it may
seem, prevailed.

This is an atom: 
Just as the boatswain was about to act the part of butcher, and Dowlas
stood, hatchet in hand, ready to complete the barbarous work, Miss
Herbey advanced, or rather crawled, towards them.

This is an atom: 
"My friends," she pleaded, "will you not wait just one more day?

This is an atom: 
If no
land or ship is in sight to-morrow, then I suppose our poor companion
must become your victim.

This is an atom: 
But allow him one more day; in the name of
mercy I entreat, I implore you.

This is an atom: 
"

My heart bounded as she made her pitiful appeal.

This is an atom: 
It seemed to me as
though the noble girl had spoken with an inspiration on her lips, and I
fancied that, perhaps, in super-natural vision she had viewed the coast
or the ship of which she spoke; and one more day was not much to us who
had already suffered so long, and endured so much.

This is an atom: 
Curtis and Falsten agreed with me, and we all united to support Miss
Herbey's merciful petition.

This is an atom: 
The sailors did not utter a murmur, and the
boatswain in a smothered voice said,--

"Very well, we will wait till daybreak tomorrow," and threw down his
hatchet.

This is an atom: 
To-morrow, then, unless land or a sail appear, the horrible sacrifice
will be accomplished.

This is an atom: 
Stifling their sufferings by a strenuous effort,
all returned to their places.

This is an atom: 
The sailors crouched beneath the sails,
caring nothing about scanning the ocean.

This is an atom: 
Food was in store for them
to-morrow, and that was enough for them.

This is an atom: 
As soon as Andre Letourneur came to his senses, his first thought was
for his father, and I saw him count the passengers on the raft.

This is an atom: 
He
looked puzzled; when he lost consciousness there had been only two
names left in the hat, those of his father and the carpenter; and yet M.
Letourneur and Dowlas were both there still.

This is an atom: 
Miss Herbey went up to
him and told him quietly that the drawing of the lots had not yet been
finished.

This is an atom: 
Andre asked no further question, but took his father's
hand.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur's countenance was calm and serene; he seemed to be
conscious of nothing except that the life of his son was spared, and as
the two sat conversing in an undertone at the back of the raft, their
whole existence seemed bound up in each other.

This is an atom: 
Meantime, I could not disabuse my mind of the impression caused by Miss
Herbey's intervention.

This is an atom: 
Something told me that help was near at hand, and
that we were approaching the termination of our suspense and misery; the
chimeras that were floating through my brain resolved themselves into
realities, so that nothing appeared to me more certain than that either
land or sail, be they miles away, would be discovered somewhere to
leeward.

This is an atom: 
Andre was as
sanguine as myself; poor boy!

This is an atom: 
he little thinks what a loss there is in
store for him tomorrow.

This is an atom: 
His father listened gravely to all we said,
and whatever he might think in his own mind, he did not give us any
discouragement; Heaven, he said, he was sure would still spare the
survivors of the "Chancellor," and then he lavished on his son caresses
which he deemed to be his last.

This is an atom: 
Some time afterwards, when I was alone with him, M. Letourneur whispered
in my ear,--

"Mr.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon, I commend my boy to your care, and mark you, he must
never know--"

His voice was choked with tears, and he could not finish his sentence.

This is an atom: 
But I was full of hope, and, without a moment's intermission, I kept my
eyes fixed upon the unbroken horizon, Curtis, Miss Herbey, Falsten, and
even the boatswain, were also eagerly scanning the broad expanse of sea.

This is an atom: 
Night has come on; but I have still a profound conviction that through
the darkness some ship will approach, and that at daybreak our raft will
be observed.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 27th.--I did not close my eyes all night, and was keenly alive
to the faintest sounds, and every ripple of the water, and every murmur
of the waves, broke distinctly on my ear.

This is an atom: 
One thing I noticed and
accepted as a happy omen; not a single shark now lingered-round the
raft.

This is an atom: 
The waning moon rose at a quarter to one, and through the feeble
glimmer which she cast across the ocean, many and many a time I fancied
I caught sight of the longed-for sail, lying only a few cables' lengths
away.

This is an atom: 
But when morning came, the sun rose once again upon a desert ocean, and
my hopes began to fade.

This is an atom: 
Neither ship nor shore had appeared, and as the
shocking hour of execution drew near, my dreams of deliverance melted
away; I shuddered in my very soul as I was brought face to face with the
stern reality.

This is an atom: 
I dared not look upon the victim, and whenever his eyes,
so full of calmness and resignation, met my own, I turned away my
head.

This is an atom: 
I felt choked with horror, and my brain reeled as though I were
intoxicated.

This is an atom: 
It was now six o'clock, and all hope had vanished from my breast; my
heart beat rapidly, and a cold sweat of agony broke out all over me.

This is an atom: 
Curtis and the boatswain stood by the mast attentively scanning the
horizon.

This is an atom: 
The boatswain's countenance was terrible to look upon;
one could see that although he would not forestall the hour, he was
determined not to wait a moment after it arrived.

This is an atom: 
As for the captain, it
was impossible to tell what really passed within his mind; his face was
livid, and his whole existence seemed concentrated in the exercise of
his power of vision.

This is an atom: 
The sailors were crawling about the platform, with
their eyes gleaming, like wild beasts ready to pounce upon their devoted
prey.

This is an atom: 
I could no longer keep my place, and glided along to the front of the
raft.

This is an atom: 
The boatswain was still standing intent on his watch, but all of a
sudden, in a voice that made me start he shouted,--

"Now then, time's up!

This is an atom: 
" and followed by Dowlas, Burke, Flaypole, and
Sandon, ran to the back of the raft.

This is an atom: 
As Dowlas seized the hatchet
convulsively, Miss Herbey could not suppress a cry of terror.

This is an atom: 
"What are you going to do to my father?

This is an atom: 
" he asked in accents choked with
emotion.

This is an atom: 
"My boy," said M. Letourneur, "the lot has fallen upon me, and I must
die!

This is an atom: 
" shrieked Andre, throwing his arms about his father, "They shall
kill me first.

This is an atom: 
It was I who threw Hobart's body into the sea, and it is
I who ought to die!

This is an atom: 
"

But the words of the unhappy youth had no other effect than to increase
the fury of the men who were so staunchly bent upon their bloody
purpose.

This is an atom: 
"Come, come, no more fuss," said Dowlas, as he tore the young man away
from his father's embrace.

This is an atom: 
Andre fell upon his back, in which position two of the sailors held him
down so tightly that he could not move, whilst Burke and Sandon carried
off their victim to the front.

This is an atom: 
All this had taken place much more rapidly than I have been able to
describe it.

This is an atom: 
I was transfixed with horror, and much as I wished to throw
myself between M. Letourneur and his executioners, I seemed to be rooted
to the spot where I was standing.

This is an atom: 
Meantime the sailors had been taking off some of M. Letourneur's
clothes, and his neck and shoulders were already bare.

This is an atom: 
" he said in a tone in which was the ring of indomitable
courage.

This is an atom: 
I don't want to deprive you of your ration; but I
suppose you will not require to eat the whole of me today.

This is an atom: 
"

The sailors, taken aback by his suggestion, stared at him with
amazement.

This is an atom: 
"There are ten of you," he went on.

This is an atom: 
"My two arms will give you each a
meal; cut them off for to-day, and to-morrow you shall have the rest of
me.

This is an atom: 
" cried Dowlas; and as M. Letourneur held out his bare arms,
quick as lightning the carpenter raised his hatchet.

This is an atom: 
Curtis and I could bear this scene no longer; whilst we were alive
to prevent it, this butchery should not be permitted, and we rushed
forwards simultaneously to snatch the victim from his murderers.

This is an atom: 
A
furious struggle ensued, and in the midst of the MELEE I was seized by
one of the sailors, and hurled violently into the sea.

This is an atom: 
Closing my lips, I tried to die of suffocation in the water; but in
spite of myself, my mouth opened, and a few drops trickled down my
throat.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 27th CONTINUED.--A change came over me as if by miracle.

This is an atom: 
No
longer had I any wish to die, and already Curtis, who had heard my
cries, was throwing me a rope.

This is an atom: 
I seized it eagerly, and was hauled up on
to the raft, "Fresh water!

This is an atom: 
" cried Curtis, "why then, my friends, we are not far from
land!

This is an atom: 
"

It was not too late; the blow had not been struck, and so the victim
had not yet fallen.

This is an atom: 
Curtis and Andre (who had regained his liberty)
had fought with the cannibals, and it was just as they were yielding to
overpowering numbers that my voice had made itself heard.

This is an atom: 
As soon as the words "Fresh water" had
escaped my lips, I leaned over the side of the raft and swallowed the
life-giving liquid in greedy draughts.

This is an atom: 
Miss Herbey was the first to
follow my example, but soon Curtis, Falsten, and all the rest were on
their knees and drinking eagerly, The rough sailors seemed as if by a
magic touch transformed back from ravenous beasts to human beings, and
I saw several of them raise their hands to heaven in silent gratitude,
Andre and his father were the last to drink.

This is an atom: 
"But where are we?

This is an atom: 
"The land is there," said Curtis pointing towards the west.

This is an atom: 
We all stared at the captain as though he were mocking us; no land was
in sight, and the raft, just as ever, was the centre of a watery waste.

This is an atom: 
Yet our senses had not deceived us the water we had been drinking was
perfectly fresh.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," repeated the captain, "land is certainly there, not more than
twenty miles to leeward.

This is an atom: 
"

"What land?

This is an atom: 
"South America," answered Curtis, "and near the Amazon; no other river
has a current strong enough to freshen the ocean twenty miles from
shore!

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 27th CONTINUED.--Curtis, no doubt was right The discharge from
the mouth of the Amazon is enormously large, but we had probably drifted
into the only spot in the Atlantic where we could find fresh water
so far from land.

This is an atom: 
Yet land, undoubtedly was there, and the breeze was
carrying us onwards slowly but surely to our deliverance.

This is an atom: 
Miss Herbey's voice was heard pouring out fervent praise to Heaven, and
we were all glad to unite our thanksgivings with hers.

This is an atom: 
Then the whole
of us (with the exception of Andre and his father, who remained by
themselves together at the stern) clustered in a group, and kept our
expectant gaze upon the horizon.

This is an atom: 
Before an hour had passed Curtis, leaped in
ecstasy and raised the joyous shout of "Land ahoy!

On the 8th the unlading of the ship commenced.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XX.

This is an atom: 
The captain and the carpenter returned to the deck with anxious faces.

This is an atom: 
All seemed simple.

This is an atom: 
"Now, my boys," said Curtis in his calm clear voice, "all together!

This is an atom: 
Off!

This is an atom: 
One moment of terrible anxiety, and all is well.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XXI.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
"Picrate of potash," was the reply.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
The night came on dark and foggy.

This is an atom: 
At daybreak they sounded again:--"Three feet of water!

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
I, with the boatswain and carpenter,
accompanied him.

This is an atom: 
But all in vain!

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
An insubordinate crew would render us powerless indeed.

Up to the poop rushed Mr.

The lieutenant and the boatswain were on the far end of the forecastle;
the remainder of the crew in the shrouds and top-masts.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
"But may she not founder at any moment?

This is an atom: 
One thing, however, is
certain, the 'Chancellor' preserves her equilibrium for the present.

This is an atom: 
"

"No, Mr.

This is an atom: 
" I marvelled
at his composure.

This is an atom: 
But here Curtis interposed:--

"Back to your places, my men; back to your places.

This is an atom: 
Mr.

This is an atom: 
These
are now our only provisions.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXVI.

This is an atom: 
DECEMBER 5th.--The day was very hot.

This is an atom: 
December in latitude 16deg.

This is an atom: 
He shook his head with
an oracular gravity.

This is an atom: 
Mrs.

This is an atom: 
A long discussion ensued.

This is an atom: 
Mr.

This is an atom: 
Is it
merely imagination?

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXVII.

This is an atom: 
"

Dead against us!

This is an atom: 
Miss Herbey heard his words, and pointing towards Mrs.

This is an atom:

At a quarter to eight we heard the boatswain calling to the sailors in
the bows.

This is an atom: 
"Ay, ay, sir," said one of the men--O'Ready, I think.

This is an atom: 
" shouted the boatswain.

This is an atom: 
"I don't know, sir.

This is an atom: 
Not with us," was the reply.

This is an atom: 
Kear, Silas Huntly, and
three sailors,--a Scotchman and two Englishmen,--were missing.

This is an atom: 
In accordance with my advice, Mrs.

This is an atom: 
Kear's, drugs would be of no avail.

The raft is a very solid structure.

Mrs.

This is an atom: 
The night passed on without further incident.

I looked round sharply.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXIX.

This is an atom: 
Anxiety, the most intense, took possession of us all.

This is an atom: 
The time was come.

This is an atom: 
At Curtis's word "Embark!

This is an atom: 
" we all hurried to the
raft.

This is an atom: 
"Now then, old fellow off of this!

This is an atom: 
" he said.

This is an atom: 
"Ay, ay!

This is an atom: 
sure enough, my man; and you'd better look sharp.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXX.

This is an atom: 
Will this frail float, forty feet by twenty, bear us in safety?

This is an atom: 
Such then is our situation; critical indeed, but after all perhaps
not desperate.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXI.

This is an atom: 
At eight o'clock this morning Curtis asked our
attention for a moment.

This is an atom: 
"My friends," he said, "listen to me.

This is an atom: 
At noon, after the necessary preliminary observations, Curtis took
the altitude of the sun.

This is an atom: 
The result gave lat.

about the same quantity of biscuit.

This is an atom: 
of
meat and 5 oz.

This is an atom: 
of biscuit for each person.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXII.

This is an atom: 
The night
passed quietly.

This is an atom: 
"I really think, Mr.

This is an atom: 
On the whole our bill of health is
tolerably satisfactory.

This is an atom: 
The 12th, 13th, and 14th of December passed away without any change in
our condition.

This is an atom: 
On the 15th we held high festival.

This is an atom: 
Unfortunately the shoal of fish did not remain long in our vicinity.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXIII.

This is an atom: 
The remainder of the day passed without incident.

This is an atom: 
On the 19th the heat was again excessive.

This is an atom: 
"Mr.

This is an atom: 
"

"Hush!

This is an atom: 
An incident sufficiently unpleasant occurred to-day.

This is an atom: 
" said the boatswain.

This is an atom: 
"Say on, then," said the captain coolly.

This is an atom: 
"

"Then you certainly will not," said the captain.

This is an atom: 
"

"Once and for all, no.

This is an atom: 
"Right!

This is an atom: 
Allow those men to have brandy!

This is an atom: 
I
would throw it all overboard first.

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XXXIV.

This is an atom: 
" said Andre to the girl.

This is an atom: 
"No, Mr.

This is an atom: 
This was the opinion of Curtis and the boatswain.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, Mr.

This is an atom: 
"

"Hark!

This is an atom: 
a squall!

This is an atom: 
"


CHAPTER XXXV.

This is an atom: 
Then the storm began to rage indeed.

This is an atom: 
Cries
of terror escaped our lips.

This is an atom: 
All must be over now!

This is an atom: 
His companion had also
disappeared.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXVI.

This is an atom: 
But of food
we have next to nothing.

This is an atom: 
Sixty pounds of biscuit
between sixteen persons!

This is an atom: 
Eight days, with half a pound a day apiece,
will consume it all.

This is an atom: 
"

At the regular hour each person received his half-pound of biscuit.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXVII.

This is an atom: 
Poor fellow!

This is an atom: 
"The truth," he said; "tell me the plain truth.

This is an atom: 
The
boatswain regarded his device with evident satisfaction.

This is an atom: 
But this biscuit is no good at all.

This is an atom: 
"You'll know soon enough," he answered.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXVIII.

This is an atom: 
On the 1st of January we swallowed our last morsel of biscuit.

This is an atom: 
The
1st of January!

This is an atom: 
New Year's Day!

This is an atom: 
The boatswain approached me with a peculiar look on his countenance.

This is an atom: 
" I said.

This is an atom: 
And this was only the second day of our misery!

This is an atom: 
Last night, however, overcome by fatigue, I
managed to rest for several hours.

This is an atom: 
I attached myself in a moment to Curtis's party.

This is an atom: 
Owen and his men advanced towards us.

This is an atom: 
"Down with the captain!

This is an atom: 
Overboard with Curtis!

This is an atom: 
Owen shall take the
command!

This is an atom: 
"Now, then, down with your arms!

This is an atom: 
"Overboard with the captain!

This is an atom: 
"

Poor stupid fool!

This is an atom: 
"Owen," said the captain once, again, "down with your arms!

This is an atom: 
A regular struggle ensued.

This is an atom: 
The unfortunate man
rolled over the side of the raft and instantly disappeared.

This is an atom: 
"Save him!

This is an atom: 
save him!

This is an atom: 
" shouted the boatswain.

This is an atom: 
" said Dowlas.

This is an atom: 
"Ah, well!

This is an atom: 
Wilson's death, however, put an end to the fray.

This is an atom: 
" sneered Owen, with the most hardened
effrontery.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXIX.

This is an atom: 
Kazallon?

This is an atom: 
"Mr.

This is an atom: 
" she asked again.

This is an atom: 
" she said.

This is an atom: 
"Mr.

This is an atom: 
Another night passed away.

This is an atom: 
"Mr.

This is an atom: 
" I asked at length.

This is an atom: 
"Hush!

This is an atom: 
" The young man clutched at it eagerly.

This is an atom: 
"But my father?

This is an atom: 
" he said inquiringly.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XL.

This is an atom: 
Never shall I
forget the scene.

This is an atom: 
Mother!

This is an atom: 
mother!

This is an atom: 
Oh my God!

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLI.

This is an atom: 
It sank immediately.

This is an atom: 
"

"Right!

This is an atom: 
" I exclaimed.

This is an atom: 
Towards eleven o'clock, a most suspicious incident occurred.

This is an atom: 
I'll try again.

This is an atom: 
"

"Oh!

This is an atom: 
I had some very good bait last night," he said.

This is an atom: 
I stared at him in
amazement.

This is an atom: 
" at last I asked.

This is an atom: 
"Yes!

This is an atom: 
We should then be thirteen.

This is an atom: 
"An unlucky number!

This is an atom: 
" said Andre with a mournful smile.

This is an atom: 
"Well, boatswain!

This is an atom: 
" I said, touching him on the shoulder.

This is an atom: 
He turned round quickly.

This is an atom: 
" I asked.

This is an atom: 
"No more," he said.

This is an atom: 
Poor Walter!

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLII.

This is an atom: 
O for
one good draught, even if it should exhaust the whole supply!

This is an atom: 
"A ship!

This is an atom: 
A ship!

This is an atom: 
" he cried.

This is an atom: 
In an instant all were on their feet.

This is an atom: 
Would the sailors with their keen vision pronounce it to be a
sail?

This is an atom: 
A silence the most profound fell upon us all.

This is an atom: 
But at length he dropped his arms and shook his head.

This is an atom: 
A deep dejection followed this phantom ray of hope.

This is an atom: 
I asked Curtis for a
little of the lukewarm water.

This is an atom: 
no!

This is an atom: 
no!

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLIII.

This is an atom: 
One and all, we fell into the gloomiest silence.

This is an atom: 
No change next day.

This is an atom: 
Oh!

This is an atom: 
But no!

This is an atom: 
Curtis
was far more deliberate in his judgment.

This is an atom: 
"

A couple of hours!

This is an atom: 
The words sounded to our ears like a couple of
centuries.

This is an atom: 
For an hour our feelings alternated between hope and despair.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLIV.

This is an atom: 
The boatswain was pale with anger.

This is an atom: 
"

Again he applied himself to his task.

This is an atom: 
"Now, then, my lads," cried the boatswain, "haul away!

This is an atom: 
"Steady!

This is an atom: 
steady!

This is an atom: 
A short sharp snap was heard.

This is an atom: 
A howl of despair burst from all our lips.

This is an atom: 
"

The captain made no reply.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLV.

This is an atom: 
"Stop, stop!

This is an atom: 
"

I looked at him in amazement.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLVI.

This is an atom: 
After a time I fell into a restless, dreamy doze.

This is an atom: 
I was neither asleep
nor awake.

This is an atom: 
I almost shrieked for joy.

This is an atom: 
It was a piece of bacon.

This is an atom: 
In a moment I understood all.

This is an atom: 
Detestable wretch!

This is an atom: 
This accounts for the inconsistency of
his well-to-do looks and his pitiable groans.

This is an atom: 
Vile hypocrite!

This is an atom: 
"His!

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLVII.

This is an atom: 
JANUARY 18th.--After this excitement I awaited the approach of day with
a strange anxiety.

This is an atom: 
But, in spite of my anxiety, I had a longing for day to come.

This is an atom: 
Meantime the moon rose high in the heavens, and the first streaks of
dawn appeared.

This is an atom: 
Then came the sailors.

This is an atom: 
But I did not, could not, look.

This is an atom: 
Neither would Miss Herbey, Andre nor his
father, consent to alleviate their pangs of hunger by such revolting
means.

This is an atom: 
Silence, the most profound, now reigns upon the raft.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLVIII.

This is an atom: 
" "Nor I!

This is an atom: 
" "Nor I!

This is an atom: 
" cried the sailors one after
another.

This is an atom: 
"

"Thief!

This is an atom: 
" I replied.

This is an atom: 
"Shame!

This is an atom: 
" I said.

This is an atom: 
"

"Now just look here, Mr.

This is an atom: 
It's all
gone somewhere, every bit.

This is an atom: 
To my great relief the search was ineffectual.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XLIX.

This is an atom: 
A frightful fatality occurred to-day.

This is an atom: 
The scene was terrible.

This is an atom: 
All at once, by one of those unaccountable impulses
of madness, his rage turned against himself.

This is an atom: 
Not a sound, not even a groan,
escapes our lips.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER LI.

This is an atom: 
No words of mine can describe this dire distress; these
sufferings are beyond human estimate.

This is an atom: 
Presently I
caught a few incoherent words.

This is an atom: 
"Fields, fields, gardens and trees!

This is an atom: 
Look, there's an inn under the
trees!

This is an atom: 
Quick, quick!

This is an atom: 
brandy, gin, water!

This is an atom: 
a guinea a drop!

This is an atom: 
I'll pay for
it!

This is an atom: 
I've lots of money!

This is an atom: 
lots!

This is an atom: 
lots!

This is an atom: 
"

Poor deluded wretch!

This is an atom: 
land!

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER LII.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER LIII.

This is an atom: 
There was no reason for postponing the
fatal lottery.

This is an atom: 
Very likely Falsten wrote them upon a leaf torn from his
memorandum-book.

This is an atom: 
Then came Falsten, Curtis, Sandon.

This is an atom: 
M. Letourneur continued his painful task.

This is an atom: 
The seventh name was Miss Herbey's, but
the young girl heard it without a start.

This is an atom: 
"Which one?

This is an atom: 
" asked the boatswain.

This is an atom: 
"Andre," said M. Letourneur.

This is an atom: 
With one cry Andre fell back senseless.

This is an atom: 
Only two names now remained in
the hat; those of Dowlas and of M. Letourneur himself.

This is an atom: 
But, unperceived by all but myself,
one little fragment flew into a corner of the raft.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER LIV.

This is an atom: 
I imparted my convictions to M. Letourneur and his son.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER LV.

This is an atom: 
Andre
started to his feet.

This is an atom: 
"

"Never!

This is an atom: 
"Stop a moment!

This is an atom: 
"Stop!

This is an atom: 
"

"Agreed!

This is an atom: 
Merciful Heaven!

This is an atom: 
the water was fresh!

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER LVI.

This is an atom: 
" were the first words I uttered.

This is an atom: 
"Fresh water?

This is an atom: 
The struggle came to an end.

This is an atom: 
" I asked at length.

This is an atom: 
" inquired the boatswain.

This is an atom: 
"



CHAPTER LVII.

This is an atom: 
We had not long to wait.

This is an atom: 
"

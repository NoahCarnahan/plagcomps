PREFACE

This is an atom: 
It has been the aim of the editor in preparing this little book to get together sufficient
material to afford a student in one of our high schools or colleges adequate and typical specimens
of the vigorous and versatile genius of Alexander Pope. With this purpose he has included in
addition to 'The Rape of the Lock', the 'Essay on Criticism' as furnishing the standard by
which Pope himself expected his work to be judged, the 'First Epistle' of the 'Essay on Man'
as a characteristic example of his didactic poetry, and the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot', both for
its exhibition of Pope's genius as a satirist and for the picture it gives of the poet himself.
To these are added the famous close of the 'Dunciad', the 'Ode to Solitude', a specimen of
Pope's infrequent lyric note, and the 'Epitaph on Gay'.

This is an atom: 
The first edition of 'The Rape of the Lock' has been given as an appendix in order that the
student may have the opportunity of comparing the two forms of this poem, and of realizing
the admirable art with which Pope blended old and new in the version that is now the only one
known to the average reader. The text throughout is that of the Globe Edition prepared by Professor
A. W. Ward.

This is an atom: 
The editor can lay no claim to originality in the notes with which he has attempted to explain
and illustrate these poems. He is indebted at every step to the labors of earlier editors,
particularly to Elwin, Courthope, Pattison, and Hales. If he has added anything of his own,
it has been in the way of defining certain words whose meaning or connotation has changed since
the time of Pope, and in paraphrasing certain passages to bring out a meaning which has been
partially obscured by the poet's effort after brevity and concision.

This is an atom: 
In the general introduction the editor has aimed not so much to recite the facts of Pope's
life as to draw the portrait of a man whom he believes to have been too often misunderstood
and misrepresented. The special introductions to the various poems are intended to acquaint
the student with the circumstances under which they were composed, to trace their literary
genesis and relationships, and, whenever necessary, to give an outline of the train of thought
which they embody.

This is an atom: 
In conclusion the editor would express the hope that his labors in the preparation of this
book may help, if only in some slight degree, to stimulate the study of the work of a poet
who, with all his limitations, remains one of the abiding glories of English literature, and
may contribute not less to a proper appreciation of a man who with all his faults was, on the
evidence of those who knew him best, not only a great poet, but a very human and lovable personality.

INTRODUCTION

This is an atom: 
Perhaps no other great poet in English Literature has been so differently judged at different
times as Alexander Pope. Accepted almost on his first appearance as one of the leading poets
of the day, he rapidly became recognized as the foremost man of letters of his age. He held
this position throughout his life, and for over half a century after his death his works were
considered not only as masterpieces, but as the finest models of poetry. With the change of
poetic temper that occurred at the beginning of the nineteenth century Pope's fame was overshadowed.
The romantic poets and critics even raised the question whether Pope was a poet at all. And
as his poetical fame diminished, the harsh judgments of his personal character increased. It
is almost incredible with what exulting bitterness critics and editors of Pope have tracked
out and exposed his petty intrigues, exaggerated his delinquencies, misrepresented his actions,
attempted in short to blast his character as a man.

This is an atom: 
Both as a man and as a poet Pope is sadly in need of a defender to-day. And a defense is by
no means impossible. The depreciation of Pope's poetry springs, in the main, from an attempt
to measure it by other standards than those which he and his age recognized. The attacks upon
his character are due, in large measure, to a misunderstanding of the spirit of the times in
which he lived and to a forgetfulness of the special circumstances of his own life. Tried in
a fair court by impartial judges Pope as a poet would be awarded a place, if not among the
noblest singers, at least high among poets of the second order. And the flaws of character
which even his warmest apologist must admit would on the one hand be explained, if not excused,
by circumstances, and on the other more than counterbalanced by the existence of noble qualities
to which his assailants seem to have been quite blind.

This is an atom: 
Alexander Pope was born in London on May 21, 1688. His father was a Roman Catholic linen draper,
who had married a second time. Pope was the only child of this marriage, and seems to have
been a delicate, sweet-tempered, precocious, and, perhaps, a rather spoiled child.

This is an atom: 
Pope's religion and his chronic ill-health are two facts of the highest importance to be taken
into consideration in any study of his life or judgment of his character. The high hopes of
the Catholics for a restoration of their religion had been totally destroyed by the Revolution
of 1688. During all Pope's lifetime they were a sect at once feared, hated, and oppressed by
the severest laws. They were excluded from the schools and universities, they were burdened
with double taxes, and forbidden to acquire real estate. All public careers were closed to
them, and their property and even their persons were in times of excitement at the mercy of
informers. In the last year of Pope's life a proclamation was issued forbidding Catholics to
come within ten miles of London, and Pope himself, in spite of his influential friends, thought
it wise to comply with this edict. A fierce outburst of persecution often evokes in the persecuted
some of the noblest qualities of human nature; but a long-continued and crushing tyranny that
extends to all the details of daily life is only too likely to have the most unfortunate results
on those who are subjected to it. And as a matter of fact we find that the well-to-do Catholics
of Pope's day lived in an atmosphere of disaffection, political intrigue, and evasion of the
law, most unfavorable for the development of that frank, courageous, and patriotic spirit for
the lack of which Pope himself has so often been made the object of reproach.

This is an atom: 
In a well-known passage of the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot', Pope has spoken of his life as one long
disease. He was in fact a humpbacked dwarf, not over four feet six inches in height, with long,
spider-like legs and arms. He was subject to violent headaches, and his face was lined and
contracted with the marks of suffering. In youth he so completely ruined his health by perpetual
studies that his life was despaired of, and only the most careful treatment saved him from
an early death. Toward the close of his life he became so weak that he could neither dress
nor undress without assistance. He had to be laced up in stiff stays in order to sit erect,
and wore a fur doublet and three pairs of stockings to protect himself against the cold. With
these physical defects he had the extreme sensitiveness of mind that usually accompanies chronic
ill health, and this sensitiveness was outraged incessantly by the brutal customs of the age.
Pope's enemies made as free with his person as with his poetry, and there is little doubt that
he felt the former attacks the more bitterly of the two. Dennis, his first critic, called him
"a short squab gentleman, the very bow of the God of love; his outward form is downright monkey."
A rival poet whom he had offended hung up a rod in a coffee house where men of letters resorted,
and threatened to whip Pope like a naughty child if he showed his face there. It is said, though
perhaps not on the best authority, that when Pope once forgot himself so far as to make love
to Lady Mary Wortley Montague, the lady's answer was "a fit of immoderate laughter." I
confided this yearning of mine to Rottenbury the other evening. Rottenbury is a man of the world
and might, I thought, be able to help me.

This is an atom: 
"My dear fellow," he said, "in these days of specialisation one has to be brought up in the
business to be an expert in anything, whether cloth or canaries or bathroom tiling. Knowledge
of this kind is not gained in a moment."
"Can you help me?" I asked.

This is an atom: 
"As regards tea, I can," he replied. "Jorkins over there is in the tea business. If you like
I'll get him to put you up to the tricks of tea-tasting."

This is an atom: 
"I should be awfully glad if you would," said I. "We never get any decent tea at home."
Jorkins appeared to be a man of direct and efficient character. I saw Rottenbury speak to him
and the next moment he was at my elbow.

This is an atom: 
"Watch me carefully," said Jorkins, "and listen to what I say. Take a little leaf into the palm
of your left hand. Rub it lightly with the fingers and gaze earnestly thus. Apply your nose
and snuff up strongly. Pick out a strand and bite through the leaf slowly with the front teeth,
thus. Just after biting pass the tip of the tongue behind the front teeth and along the palate,
completing the act of deglutition. Sorry I must go now. Good day."
Now I felt I was on the right track. I practised the thing a few times before a glass, paying
special attention to the far-away poetical look which Jorkins wore during the operation.

This is an atom: 
At the tea-shop the man behind the counter willingly showed me numbers of teas. I snatched a handful
of that which he specially recommended and began the ceremony. I took a little into the palm of
my left-hand and gazed at it earnestly; I rubbed it lightly with my fingers; I picked up a
strand and bit through the leaf slowly with the front teeth. Just after biting I passed the tongue
behind the front teeth and along the palate, completing the act of deglutition.

This is an atom: 
So far as I could judge it was very good tea, but it would never do to accept the first sample offered;
I must let the shopman see that he was up against one of the mandarins of the trade.
So I said with severity, "Please don't show me any more common stuff; I want the best you
have."

This is an atom: 
The man looked at me curiously and I saw his face twitching; he was evidently about to speak.

This is an atom: 
"Kindly refrain from expostulating," I went on; "content yourself with showing me your finest
blend."
He went away to the back of the shop, muttering; clearly he recognised defeat, for when he
returned he carried a small chest.

This is an atom: 
"Try this," said he, and I knew that he was boiling with baffled
rage.

This is an atom: 
I took a handful and once more went through the whole ceremony. It
was nauseating, but the man was obviously impressed. At the conclusion
of my performance I assumed a look of satisfaction.
"Give me five pounds of that," said I with the air of a conqueror.
Next time I met Rottenbury I told him of my success.
"Oh, Jorkins put you up to the trick, did he?"
"He did. He taught me to titillate, to triturate, to masticate, to
deglute--everything." 
"And with what result?"
"With the result that I have in my possession five pounds of the
finest tea that the greatest experts have blended from the combined
products of Assam and China." 
"Tea?" he asked.
"Yes, tea of course. You didn't suppose that I was talking of
oysters?" 
"Did I tell you Jorkins was a tea-taster?" 
"Yes."
"Well, then, he's not. He's in tobacco." 
* * * * *
"Alured," said my wife, "I wish you wouldn't buy things for the
house. That tea is low-grade sweepings."

ADVERTISING ENTHUSIAST ON HIS HOLIDAY SEEKING INSPIRATION FOR A NEW
ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE UNDERGROUND RAILWAYIn
the year 1713 he gradually drew away from them and came under the influence of Swift, then
at the height of his power in political and social life. Swift introduced him to the brilliant
Tories, politicians and lovers of letters, Harley, Bolingbroke, and Atterbury, who were then
at the head of affairs. Pope's new friends seem to have treated him with a deference which
he had never experienced before, and which bound him to them in unbroken affection. Harley
used to regret that Pope's religion rendered him legally incapable of holding a sinecure office
in the government, such as was frequently bestowed in those days upon men of letters, and Swift
jestingly offered the young poet twenty guineas to become a Protestant. But now, as later,
Pope was firmly resolved not to abandon the faith of his parents for the sake of worldly advantage.
And in order to secure the independence he valued so highly he resolved to embark upon the
great work of his life, the translation of Homer.

This is an atom: 
"What led me into that," he told a friend long after, "was purely the want of money. I had
then none; not even to buy books." It seems that about this time, 1713, Pope's father had experienced
some heavy financial losses, and the poet, whose receipts in money had so far been by no means
in proportion to the reputation his works had brought him, now resolved to use that reputation
as a means of securing from the public a sum which would at least keep him for life from poverty
or the necessity of begging for patronage. It is worth noting that Pope was the first Englishman
of letters who threw himself thus boldly upon the public and earned his living by his pen.

This is an atom: 
The arrangements for the publication and sale of Pope's translation of Homer were made with
care and pushed on with enthusiasm. He issued in 1713 his proposals for an edition to be published
by subscription, and his friends at once became enthusiastic canvassers. We have a characteristic
picture of Swift at this time, bustling about a crowded ante-chamber, and informing the company
that the best poet in England was Mr. Pope (a Papist) who had begun a translation of Homer
for which they must all subscribe, "for," says he, "the author shall not begin to print till
I have a thousand guineas for him." The work was to be in six volumes, each costing a guinea.
Pope obtained 575 subscribers, many of whom took more than one set. Lintot, the publisher,
gave Pope Â£1200 for the work and agreed to supply the subscription copies free of charge. As
a result Pope made something between Â£5000 and Â£6000, a sum absolutely unprecedented in the
history of English literature, and amply sufficient to make him independent for life.

This is an atom: 
But the sum was honestly earned by hard and wearisome work. Pope was no Greek scholar; it is
said, indeed, that he was just able to make out the sense of the original with a translation.
And in addition to the fifteen thousand lines of the 'Iliad', he had engaged to furnish an
introduction and notes. At first the magnitude of the undertaking frightened him. "What terrible
moments," he said to Spence, "does one feel after one has engaged for a large work. In the
beginning of my translating the 'Iliad', I wished anybody would hang me a hundred times. It
sat so heavily on my mind at first that I often used to dream of it and do sometimes still."
In spite of his discouragement, however, and of the ill health which so constantly beset him,
Pope fell gallantly upon his task, and as time went on came almost to enjoy it. He used to
translate thirty or forty verses in the morning before rising and, in his own characteristic
phrase, "piddled over them for the rest of the day." He used every assistance possible, drew
freely upon the scholarship of friends, corrected and recorrected with a view to obtaining
clearness and point, and finally succeeded in producing a version which not only satisfied
his own critical judgment, but was at once accepted by the English-speaking world as the standard
translation of Homer.

This is an atom: 
The first volume came out in June, 1715, and to Pope's dismay and wrath a rival translation
appeared almost simultaneously. Tickell, one of Addison's "little senate," had also begun a
translation of the 'Iliad', and although he announced in the preface that he intended to withdraw
in favor of Pope and take up a translation of the 'Odyssey', the poet's suspicions were at
once aroused. And they were quickly fanned into a flame by the gossip of the town which reported
that Addison, the recognized authority in literary criticism, pronounced Tickell's version
"the best that ever was in any language." Rumor went so far, in fact, as to hint pretty broadly
that Addison himself was the author, in part, at least, of Tickell's book; and Pope, who had
been encouraged by Addison to begin his long task, felt at once that he had been betrayed.
His resentment was all the more bitter since he fancied that Addison, now at the height of
his power and prosperity in the world of letters and of politics, had attempted to ruin an
enterprise on which the younger man had set all his hopes of success and independence, for
no better reason than literary jealousy and political estrangement. We know now that Pope was
mistaken, but there was beyond question some reason at the time for his thinking as he did,
and it is to the bitterness which this incident caused in his mind that we owe the famous satiric
portrait of Addison as Atticus.

This is an atom: 
The last volume of the 'Iliad' appeared in the spring of 1720, and in it Pope gave a renewed
proof of his independence by dedicating the whole work, not to some lord who would have rewarded
him with a handsome present, but to his old acquaintance, Congreve, the last survivor of the
brilliant comic dramatists of Dryden's day. And now resting for a time from his long labors,
Pope turned to the adornment and cultivation of the little house and garden that he had leased
at Twickenham.

This is an atom: 
Pope's father had died in 1717, and the poet, rejecting politely but firmly the suggestion
of his friend, Atterbury, that he might now turn Protestant, devoted himself with double tenderness
to the care of his aged and infirm mother. He brought her with him to Twickenham, where she
lived till 1733, dying in that year at the great age of ninety-one. It may have been partly
on her account that Pope pitched upon Twickenham as his abiding place. Beautifully situated
on the banks of the Thames, it was at once a quiet country place and yet of easy access to
London, to Hampton Court, or to Kew. The five acres of land that lay about the house furnished
Pope with inexhaustible entertainment for the rest of his life. He "twisted and twirled and
harmonized" his bit of ground "till it appeared two or three sweet little lawns opening and
opening beyond one another, the whole surrounded by impenetrable woods." Following the taste
of his times in landscape gardening, he adorned his lawns with artificial mounds, a shell temple,
an obelisk, and a colonnade. But the crowning glory was the grotto, a tunnel decorated fantastically
with shells and bits of looking-glass, which Pope dug under a road that ran through his grounds.
Here Pope received in state, and his house and garden was for years the center of the most
brilliant society in England. Here Swift came on his rare visits from Ireland, and Bolingbroke
on his return from exile. Arbuthnot, Pope's beloved physician, was a frequent visitor, and
Peterborough, one of the most distinguished of English soldiers, condescended to help lay out
the garden. Congreve came too, at times, and Gay, the laziest and most good-natured of poets.
Nor was the society of women lacking at these gatherings. Lady Mary Wortley Montague, the wittiest
woman in England, was often there, until her bitter quarrel with the poet; the grim old Duchess
of Marlborough appeared once or twice in Pope's last years; and the Princess of Wales came
with her husband to inspire the leaders of the opposition to the hated Walpole and the miserly
king. And from first to last, the good angel of the place was the blue-eyed, sweet-tempered
Patty Blount, Pope's best and dearest friend.

This is an atom: 
Not long after the completion of the 'Iliad', Pope undertook to edit Shakespeare, and completed
the work in 1724. The edition is, of course, quite superseded now, but it has its place in
the history of Shakespearean studies as the first that made an effort, though irregular and
incomplete, to restore the true text by collation and conjecture. It has its place, too, in
the story of Pope's life, since the bitter criticism which it received, all the more unpleasant
to the poet since it was in the main true, was one of the principal causes of his writing the
'Dunciad'. Between the publication of his edition of Shakespeare, however, and the appearance
of the 'Dunciad', Pope resolved to complete his translation of Homer, and with the assistance
of a pair of friends, got out a version of the Odyssey in 1725. Like the 'Iliad', this was
published by subscription, and as in the former case the greatest men in England were eager
to show their appreciation of the poet by filling up his lists. Sir Robert Walpole, the great
Whig statesman, took ten copies, and Harley, the fallen Tory leader, put himself, his wife,
and his daughter down for sixteen. Pope made, it is said, about Â£3700 by this work.

This is an atom: 
In 1726, Swift visited Pope and encouraged him to complete a satire which he seems already
to have begun on the dull critics and hack writers of the day. For one cause or another its
publication was deferred until 1728, when it appeared under the title of the 'Dunciad'. Here
Pope declared open war upon his enemies. All those who had attacked his works, abused his character,
or scoffed at his personal deformities, were caricatured as ridiculous and sometimes disgusting
figures in a mock epic poem celebrating the accession of a new monarch to the throne of Dullness.
The 'Dunciad' is little read to-day except by professed students of English letters, but it
made, naturally enough, a great stir at the time and vastly provoked the wrath of all the dunces
whose names it dragged to light. Pope has often been blamed for stooping to such ignoble combat,
and in particular for the coarseness of his abuse, and for his bitter jests upon the poverty
of his opponents. But it must be remembered that no living writer had been so scandalously
abused as Pope, and no writer that ever lived was by nature so quick to feel and to resent
insult. The undoubted coarseness of the work is in part due to the gross license of the times
in speech and writing, and more particularly to the influence of Swift, at this time predominant
over Pope. And in regard to Pope's trick of taunting his enemies with poverty, it must frankly
be confessed that he seized upon this charge as a ready and telling weapon. Pope was at heart
one of the most charitable of men. In the days of his prosperity he is said to have given away
one eighth of his income. And he was always quick to succor merit in distress; he pensioned
the poet Savage and he tried to secure patronage for Johnson. But for the wretched hack writers
of the common press who had barked against him he had no mercy, and he struck them with the
first rod that lay ready to his hands.

This is an atom: 
During his work on the 'Dunciad', Pope came into intimate relations with Bolingbroke, who in
1725 had returned from his long exile in France and had settled at Dawley within easy reach
of Pope's villa at Twickenham. Bolingbroke was beyond doubt one of the most brilliant and stimulating
minds of his age. Without depth of intellect or solidity of character, he was at once a philosopher,
a statesman, a scholar, and a fascinating talker. Pope, who had already made his acquaintance,
was delighted to renew and improve their intimacy, and soon came wholly under the influence
of his splendid friend. It is hardly too much to say that all the rest of Pope's work is directly
traceable to Bolingbroke. The 'Essay on Man' was built up on the precepts of Bolingbroke's
philosophy; the 'Imitations of Horace' were undertaken at Bolingbroke's suggestion; and the
whole tone of Pope's political and social satire during the years from 1731 to 1738 reflects
the spirit of that opposition to the administration of Walpole and to the growing influence
of the commercial class, which was at once inspired and directed by Bolingbroke. And yet it
is exactly in the work of this period that we find the best and with perhaps one exception,
the 'Essay on Man', the most original, work of Pope. He has obtained an absolute command over
his instrument of expression. In his hands the heroic couplet sings, and laughs, and chats,
and thunders. He has turned from the ignoble warfare with the dunces to satirize courtly frivolity
and wickedness in high places. And most important of all to the student of Pope, it is in these
last works that his personality is most clearly revealed. It has been well said that the best
introduction to the study of Pope, the man, is to get the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot' by heart.

This is an atom: 
Pope gradually persuaded himself that all the works of these years, the 'Essay on Man', the
'Satires, Epistles', and 'Moral Essays', were but parts of one stupendous whole. He told Spence
in the last years of his life: "I had once thought of completing my ethic work in four books.--The
first, you know, is on the Nature of Man [the 'Essay on Man']; the second would have been on
knowledge and its limits--here would have come in an Essay on Education, part of which I have
inserted in the 'Dunciad' ['i.e.' in the Fourth Book, published in 1742]. The third was to
have treated of Government, both ecclesiastical and civil--and this was what chiefly stopped
my going on. I could not have said what 'I would' have said without provoking every church
on the face of the earth; and I did not care for living always in boiling water.--This part
would have come into my 'Brutus' [an epic poem which Pope never completed], which is planned
already. The fourth would have been on Morality; in eight or nine of the most concerning branches
of it."

This is an atom: 
It is difficult, if not impossible, to believe that Pope with his irregular methods of work
and illogical habit of thought had planned so vast and elaborate a system before he began its
execution. It is far more likely that he followed his old method of composing on the inspiration
of the moment, and produced the works in question with little thought of their relation or
interdependence. But in the last years of his life, when he had made the acquaintance of Warburton,
and was engaged in reviewing and perfecting the works of this period, he noticed their general
similarity in form and spirit, and, possibly under Warburton's influence, conceived the notion
of combining and supplementing them to form that "Greater Essay on Man" of which he spoke to
Spence, and of which Warburton himself has given us a detailed account.

This is an atom: 
Warburton, a wide-read, pompous, and polemical clergyman, had introduced himself to the notice
of Pope by a defense of the philosophical and religious principles of the 'Essay on Man'. In
spite of the influence of the free-thinking Bolingbroke, Pope still remained a member of the
Catholic church and sincerely believed himself to be an orthodox, though liberal, Christian,
and he had, in consequence, been greatly disconcerted by a criticism of his poem published
in Switzerland and lately translated into English. Its author, Pierre de Crousaz, maintained,
and with a considerable degree of truth, that the principles of Pope's poem if pushed to their
logical conclusion were destructive to religion and would rank their author rather among atheists
than defenders of the faith. The very word "atheist" was at that day sufficient to put the
man to whom it was applied beyond the pale of polite society, and Pope, who quite lacked the
ability to refute in logical argument the attack of de Crousaz, was proportionately delighted
when Warburton came forward in his defense, and in a series of letters asserted that Pope's
whole intention was to vindicate the ways of God to man, and that de Crousaz had mistaken his
purpose and misunderstood his language. Pope's gratitude to his defender knew no bounds; he
declared that Warburton understood the 'Essay' better than he did himself; he pronounced him
the greatest critic he ever knew, secured an introduction to him, introduced him to his own
rich and influential friends, in short made the man's fortune for him outright. When the University
of Oxford hesitated to give Warburton, who had never attended a university, the degree of D.D.,
Pope declined to accept the degree of D.C.L. which had been offered him at the same time, and
wrote the Fourth Book of the 'Dunciad' to satirize the stupidity of the university authorities.
In conjunction with Warburton he proceeded further to revise the whole poem, for which his
new friend wrote notes and a ponderous introduction, and made the capital mistake of substituting
the frivolous, but clever, Colley Gibber, with whom he had recently become embroiled, for his
old enemy, Theobald, as the hero. And the last year of his life was spent in getting out new
editions of his poems accompanied by elaborate commentaries from the pen of Warburton.

This is an atom: 
In the spring of 1744, it was evident that Pope was failing fast. In addition to his other
ailments he was now attacked by an asthmatical dropsy, which no efforts of his physicians could
remove. Yet he continued to work almost to the last, and distributed copies of his 'Ethic Epistles'
to his friends about three weeks before his death, with the smiling remark that like the dying
Socrates he was dispensing his morality among his friends. His mind began to wander; he complained
that he saw all things as through a curtain, and told Spence once "with a smile of great pleasure
and with the greatest softness" that he had seen a vision. His friends were devoted in their
attendance. Bolingbroke sat weeping by his chair, and on Spence's remarking how Pope with every
rally was always saying something kindly of his friends, replied: "I never in my life knew
a man that had so tender a heart for his particular friends, or a more general friendship for
mankind. I have known him these thirty years; and value myself more for that man's love than"--here
his head dropped and his voice broke in tears. It was noticed that whenever Patty Blount came
into the room, the dying flame of life flashed up in a momentary glow. At the very end a friend
reminded Pope that as a professed Catholic he ought to send for a priest. The dying man replied
that he did not believe it essential, but thanked him for the suggestion. When the priest appeared,
Pope attempted to rise from his bed that he might receive the sacrament kneeling, and the priest
came out from the sick room "penetrated to the last degree with the state of mind in which
he found his penitent, resigned and wrapt up in the love of God and man." The hope that sustained
Pope to the end was that of immortality. "I am so certain of the soul's being immortal," he
whispered, almost with his last breath, "that I seem to feel it within me, as it were by intuition."
He died on the evening of May 30, so quietly that his friends hardly knew that the end had
come. He was buried in Twickenham Church, near the monument he had erected to his parents,
and his coffin was carried to the grave by six of the poorest men of the parish.

This is an atom: 
It is plain even from so slight a sketch as this that the common conception of Pope as "the
wicked wasp of Twickenham," a bitter, jealous, and malignant spirit, is utterly out of accord
with the facts of his life. Pope's faults of character lie on the surface, and the most perceptible
is that which has done him most harm in the eyes of English-speaking men. He was by nature,
perhaps by training also, untruthful. If he seldom stooped to an outright lie, he never hesitated
to equivocate; and students of his life have found that it is seldom possible to take his word
on any point where his own works or interests were concerned. I have already (p. x) attempted
to point out the probable cause of this defect; and it is, moreover, worth while to remark
that Pope's manifold intrigues and evasions were mainly of the defensive order. He plotted
and quibbled not so much to injure others as to protect himself. To charge Pope with treachery
to his friends, as has sometimes been done, is wholly to misunderstand his character.

This is an atom: 
Another flaw, one can hardly call it a vice, in Pope's character was his constant practice
of considering everything that came in his way as copy. It was this which led him to reclaim
his early letters from his friends, to alter, rewrite, and redate them, utterly unconscious
of the trouble which he was preparing for his future biographers. The letters, he thought,
were good reading but not so good as he could make them, and he set to work to improve them
with all an artist's zeal, and without a trace of a historian's care for facts. It was this
which led him to embody in his description of a rich fool's splendid house and park certain
unmistakable traces of a living nobleman's estate and to start in genuine amazement and regret
when the world insisted on identifying the nobleman and the fool. And when Pope had once done
a good piece of work, he had all an artist's reluctance to destroy it. He kept bits of verse
by him for years and inserted them into appropriate places in his poems. This habit it was
that brought about perhaps the gravest charge that has ever been made against Pope, that of
accepting Â£1000 to suppress a satiric portrait of the old Duchess of Marlborough, and yet of
publishing it in a revision of a poem that he was engaged on just before his death. The truth
seems to be that Pope had drawn this portrait in days when he was at bitter enmity with the
Duchess, and after the reconcilement that took place, unwilling to suppress it entirely, had
worked it over, and added passages out of keeping with the first design, but pointing to another
lady with whom he was now at odds. Pope's behavior, we must admit, was not altogether creditable,
but it was that of an artist reluctant to throw away good work, not that of a ruffian who stabs
a woman he has taken money to spare.

This is an atom: 
Finally Pope was throughout his life, and notably in his later years, the victim of an irritable
temper and a quick, abusive tongue. His irritability sprang in part, we may believe, from his
physical sufferings, even more, however, from the exquisitely sensitive heart which made him
feel a coarse insult as others would a blow. And of the coarseness of the insults that were
heaped upon Pope no one except the careful student of his life can have any conception. His
genius, his morals, his person, his parents, and his religion were overwhelmed in one indiscriminate
flood of abuse. Too high spirited to submit tamely to these attacks, too irritable to laugh
at them, he struck back, and his weapon was personal satire which cut like a whip and left
a brand like a hot iron. And if at times, as in the case of Addison, Pope was mistaken in his
object and assaulted one who was in no sense his enemy, the fault lies not so much in his alleged
malice as in the unhappy state of warfare in which he lived.

This is an atom: 
Over against the faults of Pope we may set more than one noble characteristic. The sensitive
heart and impulsive temper that led him so often into bitter warfare, made him also most susceptible
to kindness and quick to pity suffering. He was essentially of a tender and loving nature,
a devoted son, and a loyal friend, unwearied in acts of kindness and generosity. His ruling
passion, to use his own phrase, was a devotion to letters, and he determined as early and worked
as diligently to make himself a poet as ever Milton did. His wretched body was dominated by
a high and eager mind, and he combined in an unparalleled degree the fiery energy of the born
poet with the tireless patience of the trained artist.

This is an atom: 
But perhaps the most remarkable characteristic of Pope is his manly independence. In an age
when almost without exception his fellow-writers stooped to accept a great man's patronage
or sold their talents into the slavery of politics, Pope stood aloof from patron and from party.
He repeatedly declined offers of money that were made him, even when no condition was attached.
He refused to change his religion, though he was far from being a devout Catholic, in order
to secure a comfortable place. He relied upon his genius alone for his support, and his genius
gave him all that he asked, a modest competency. His relations with his rich and powerful friends
were marked by the same independent spirit. He never cringed or flattered, but met them on
even terms, and raised himself by merit alone from his position as the unknown son of an humble
shopkeeper to be the friend and associate of the greatest fortunes and most powerful minds
in England. It is not too much to say that the career of a man of letters as we know it to-day,
a career at once honorable and independent, takes its rise from the life and work of Alexander
Pope.

This is an atom: 
The long controversies that have raged about Pope's rank as a poet seem at last to be drawing
to a close; and it has become possible to strike a balance between the exaggerated praise of
his contemporaries and the reckless depreciation of romantic critics. That he is not a poet
of the first order is plain, if for no other reason than that he never produced a work in any
of the greatest forms of poetry. The drama, the epic, the lyric, were all outside his range.
On the other hand, unless a definition of poetry be framed--and Dr. Johnson has well remarked
that "to circumscribe poetry by a definition will only show the narrowness of the definer"--which
shall exclude all gnomic and satiric verse, and so debar the claims of Hesiod, Juvenal, and
Boileau, it is impossible to deny that Pope is a true poet. Certain qualities of the highest
poet Pope no doubt lacked, lofty imagination, intense passion, wide human sympathy. But within
the narrow field which he marked out for his own he approaches perfection as nearly as any
English poet, and Pope's merit consists not merely in the smoothness of his verse or the polish
of separate epigrams, as is so often stated, but quite as much in the vigor of his conceptions
and the unity and careful proportion of each poem as a whole. It is not too much to say that
'The Rape of the Lock' is one of the best-planned poems in any language. It is as symmetrical
and exquisitely finished as a Grecian temple.

This is an atom: 
Historically Pope represents the fullest embodiment of that spirit which began to appear in
English literature about the middle of the seventeenth century, and which we are accustomed
to call the "classical" spirit. In essence this movement was a protest against the irregularity
and individual license of earlier poets. Instead of far-fetched wit and fanciful diction, the
classical school erected the standards of common sense in conception and directness in expression.
And in so doing they restored poetry which had become the diversion of the few to the possession
of the many. Pope, for example, is preeminently the poet of his time. He dealt with topics
that were of general interest to the society in which he lived; he pictured life as he saw
it about him. And this accounts for his prompt and general acceptance by the world of his day.

This is an atom: 
For the student of English literature Pope's work has a threefold value. It represents the
highest achievement of one of the great movements in the developments of English verse. It
reflects with unerring accuracy the life and thought of his time--not merely the outward life
of beau and belle in the days of Queen Anne, but the ideals of the age in art, philosophy,
and politics. And finally it teaches as hardly any other body of English verse can be said
to do, the perennial value of conscious and controlling art. Pope's work lives and will live
while English poetry is read, not because of its inspiration, imagination, or depth of thought,
but by its unity of design, vigor of expression, and perfection of finish--by those qualities,
in short, which show the poet as an artist in verse.

TO MRS. ARABELLA FERMOR

This is an atom: 
MADAM,

This is an atom: 
It will be in vain to deny that I have some regard for this piece, since I dedicate it to You.
Yet you may bear me witness, it was intended only to divert a few young Ladies, who have good
sense and good humour enough to laugh not only at their sex's little unguarded follies, but
at their own. But as it was communicated with the air of a Secret, it soon found its way into
the world. An imperfect copy having been offer'd to a Bookseller, you had the good-nature for
my sake to consent to the publication of one more correct: This I was forc'd to, before I had
executed half my design, for the Machinery was entirely wanting to compleat it.

This is an atom: 
The Machinery, Madam, is a term invented by the Critics, to signify that part which the Deities,
Angels, or DÃ¦mons are made to act in a Poem: For the ancient Poets are in one respect like
many modern Ladies: let an action be never so trivial in itself, they always make it appear
of the utmost importance. These Machines I determined to raise on a very new and odd foundation,
the Rosicrucian doctrine of Spirits.

This is an atom: 
I know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard words before a Lady; but't is so much the
concern of a Poet to have his works understood, and particularly by your Sex, that you must
give me leave to explain two or three difficult terms.

This is an atom: 
The Rosicrucians are a people I must bring you acquainted with. The best account I know of
them is in a French book call'd 'Le Comte de Gabalis', which both in its title and size is
so like a Novel, that many of the Fair Sex have read it for one by mistake. According to these
Gentlemen, the four Elements are inhabited by Spirits, which they call Sylphs, Gnomes, Nymphs,
and Salamanders. The Gnomes or DÃ¦mons of Earth delight in mischief; but the Sylphs whose habitation
is in the Air, are the best-condition'd creatures imaginable. For they say, any mortals may
enjoy the most intimate familiarities with these gentle Spirits, upon a condition very easy
to all true Adepts, an inviolate preservation of Chastity.

This is an atom: 
As to the following Canto's, all the passages of them are as fabulous, as the Vision at the
beginning, or the Transformation at the end; (except the loss of your Hair, which I always
mention with reverence). The Human persons are as fictitious as the airy ones; and the character
of Belinda, as it is now manag'd, resembles you in nothing but in Beauty.

This is an atom: 
If this Poem had as many Graces as there are in your Person, or in your Mind, yet I could never
hope it should pass thro' the world half so Uncensur'd as You have done. But let its fortune
be what it will, mine is happy enough, to have given me this occasion of assuring you that
I am, with the truest esteem, Madam,

This is an atom: 
Your most obedient, Humble Servant,

What dire offence from am'rous causes springs,
  What mighty contests rise from trivial things,
  I sing--This verse to CARYL, Muse! is due:
  This, ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view:
  Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,                    5
  If She inspire, and He approve my lays.

This is an atom: 
Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel
  A well-bred Lord t' assault a gentle Belle?
  O say what stranger cause, yet unexplor'd,
  Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?                        10
  In tasks so bold, can little men engage,
  And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty Rage?

Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray,
  And oped those eyes that must eclipse the day:
  Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake,                 15
  And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:
  Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground,
  And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound.
  Belinda still her downy pillow prest,
  Her guardian SYLPH prolong'd the balmy rest:                    20
  'Twas He had summon'd to her silent bed
  The morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head;
  A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birth-night Beau,
  (That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow)
  Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay,                      25
  And thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say.

This is an atom: 
Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care
  Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air!
  If e'er one vision touch.'d thy infant thought,
  Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught;                30
  Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen,
  The silver token, and the circled green,
  Or virgins visited by Angel-pow'rs,
  With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs;
  Hear and believe! thy own importance know,                      35
  Nor bound thy narrow views to things below.
  Some secret truths, from learned pride conceal'd,
  To Maids alone and Children are reveal'd:
  What tho' no credit doubting Wits may give?
  The Fair and Innocent shall still believe.                      40
  Know, then, unnumber'd Spirits round thee fly,
  The light Militia of the lower sky:
  These, tho' unseen, are ever on the wing,
  Hang o'er the Box, and hover round the Ring.
  Think what an equipage thou hast in Air,                        45
  And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair.
  As now your own, our beings were of old,
  And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous mould;
  Thence, by a soft transition, we repair
  From earthly Vehicles to these of air.                          50
  Think not, when Woman's transient breath is fled
  That all her vanities at once are dead;
  Succeeding vanities she still regards,
  And tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.
  Her joy in gilded Chariots, when alive,                         55
  And love of Ombre, after death survive.
  For when the Fair in all their pride expire,
  To their first Elements their Souls retire:
  The Sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame
  Mount up, and take a Salamander's name.                         60
  Soft yielding minds to Water glide away,
  And sip, with Nymphs, their elemental Tea.
  The graver Prude sinks downward to a Gnome,
  In search of mischief still on Earth to roam.
  The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,                     65
  And sport and flutter in the fields of Air.

This is an atom: 
"Know further yet; whoever fair and chaste
  Rejects mankind, is by some Sylph embrac'd:
  For Spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease
  Assume what sexes and what shapes they please.                  70
  What guards the purity of melting Maids,
  In courtly balls, and midnight masquerades,
  Safe from the treach'rous friend, the daring spark,
  The glance by day, the whisper in the dark,
  When kind occasion prompts their warm desires,                  75
  When music softens, and when dancing fires?
  'Tis but their Sylph, the wise Celestials know,
  Tho' Honour is the word with Men below.

This is an atom: 
Some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face,
  For life predestin'd to the Gnomes' embrace.                    80
  These swell their prospects and exalt their pride,
  When offers are disdain'd, and love deny'd:
  Then gay Ideas crowd the vacant brain,
  While Peers, and Dukes, and all their sweeping train,
  And Garters, Stars, and Coronets appear,                        85
  And in soft sounds, Your Grace salutes their ear.
  'T is these that early taint the female soul,
  Instruct the eyes of young Coquettes to roll,
  Teach Infant-cheeks a bidden blush to know,
  And little hearts to flutter at a Beau.                         90

This is an atom: 
Oft, when the world imagine women stray,
  The Sylphs thro' mystic mazes guide their way,
  Thro' all the giddy circle they pursue,
  And old impertinence expel by new.
  What tender maid but must a victim fall                         95
  To one man's treat, but for another's ball?
  When Florio speaks what virgin could withstand,
  If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand?
  With varying vanities, from ev'ry part,
  They shift the moving Toyshop of their heart;                  100
  Where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive,
  Beaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive.
  This erring mortals Levity may call;
  Oh blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.

  A watchful sprite, and Ariel is my name.
  Late, as I rang'd the crystal wilds of air,
  In the clear Mirror of thy ruling Star
  I saw, alas! some dread event impend,
  Ere to the main this morning sun descend,                      110
  But heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where:
  Warn'd by the Sylph, oh pious maid, beware!
  This to disclose is all thy guardian can:
  Beware of all, but most beware of Man!"

  Thy eyes first open'd on a Billet-doux;

  But all the Vision vanish'd from thy head.                     120

And now, unveil'd, the Toilet stands display'd,
  Each silver Vase in mystic order laid.

  With head uncover'd, the Cosmetic pow'rs.
  A heav'nly image in the glass appears,                         125
  To that she bends, to that her eyes she rears;
  Th' inferior Priestess, at her altar's side,
  Trembling begins the sacred rites of Pride.
  Unnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here
  The various off'rings of the world appear;                     130
  From each she nicely culls with curious toil,
  And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring spoil.
  This casket India's glowing gems unlocks,
  And all Arabia breathes from yonder box.
  The Tortoise here and Elephant unite,                          135
  Transformed to combs, the speckled, and the white.
  Here files of pins extend their shining rows,
  Puffs, Powders, Patches, Bibles, Billet-doux.
  Now awful Beauty puts on all its arms;
  The fair each moment rises in her charms,                      140
  Repairs her smiles, awakens ev'ry grace,
  And calls forth all the wonders of her face;
  Sees by degrees a purer blush arise,
  And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes.
  The busy Sylphs surround their darling care,                   145
  These set the head, and those divide the hair,
  Some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown:

Not with more glories, in th' etherial plain,
  The Sun first rises o'er the purpled main,
  Than, issuing forth, the rival of his beams
  Launch'd on the bosom of the silver Thames.
  Fair Nymphs, and well-drest Youths around her shone.             5
  But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone.
  On her white breast a sparkling Cross she wore,
  Which Jews might kiss, and Infidels adore.
  Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,
  Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those:                     10
  Favours to none, to all she smiles extends;
  Oft she rejects, but never once offends.
  Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,
  And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.
  Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride,                 15
  Might hide her faults, if Belles had faults to hide:
  If to her share some female errors fall,
  Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.

This Nymph, to the destruction of mankind,
  Nourish'd two Locks, which graceful hung behind                 20
  In equal curls, and well conspir'd to deck
  With shining ringlets the smooth iv'ry neck.
  Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains,
  And mighty hearts are held in slender chains.
  With hairy springes we the birds betray,                        25
  Slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey,
  Fair tresses man's imperial race ensnare,
  And beauty draws us with a single hair.

  By force to ravish, or by fraud betray;
  For when success a Lover's toil attends,

For this, ere Phoebus rose, he had implor'd                     35

  Of twelve vast French Romances, neatly gilt.
  There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves;
  And all the trophies of his former loves;                       40
  With tender Billet-doux he lights the pyre,
  And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire.
  Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes
  Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize:
  The pow'rs gave ear, and granted half his pray'r,               45

  Smooth flow the waves, the Zephyrs gently play,
  Belinda smil'd, and all the world was gay.
  All but the Sylph--with careful thoughts opprest,
  Th' impending woe sat heavy on his breast.
  He summons strait his Denizens of air;                          55
  The lucid squadrons round the sails repair:
  Soft o'er the shrouds aÃ«rial whispers breathe,
  That seem'd but Zephyrs to the train beneath.
  Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold,
  Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold;                  60
  Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight,
  Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light,
  Loose to the wind their airy garments flew,
  Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew,
  Dipt in the richest tincture of the skies,                      65
  Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes,
  While ev'ry beam new transient colours flings,
  Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings.
  Amid the circle, on the gilded mast,
  Superior by the head, was Ariel plac'd;                         70
  His purple pinions op'ning to the sun,
  He rais'd his azure wand, and thus begun.

This is an atom: 
Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear!
  Fays, Fairies, Genii, Elves, and DÃ¦mons, hear!
  Ye know the spheres and various tasks assign'd                  75
  By laws eternal to th' aÃ«rial kind.
  Some in the fields of purest Ãther play,
  And bask and whiten in the blaze of day.
  Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high,
  Or roll the planets thro' the boundless sky.                    80
  Some less refin'd, beneath the moon's pale light
  Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night,
  Or suck the mists in grosser air below,
  Or dip their pinions in the painted bow,
  Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main,                     85
  Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain.
  Others on earth o'er human race preside,
  Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide:
  Of these the chief the care of Nations own,
  And guard with Arms divine the British Throne.                  90

This is an atom: 
Our humbler province is to tend the Fair,
  Not a less pleasing, tho' less glorious care;
  To save the powder from too rude a gale,
  Nor let th' imprison'd-essences exhale;
  To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs;                  95
  To steal from rainbows e'er they drop in show'rs
  A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs,
  Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs;
  Nay oft, in dreams, invention we bestow,
  To change a Flounce, or add a Furbelow.                        100

This is an atom: 
This day, black Omens threat the brightest Fair,
  That e'er deserv'd a watchful spirit's care;
  Some dire disaster, or by force, or slight;
  But what, or where, the fates have wrapt in night.
  Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law,                     105
  Or some frail China jar receive a flaw;
  Or stain her honour or her new brocade;
  Forget her pray'rs, or miss a masquerade;
  Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball;
  Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that Shock must fall.             110
  Haste, then, ye spirits! to your charge repair:
  The flutt'ring fan be Zephyretta's care;
  The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign;
  And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine;
  Do thou, Crispissa, tend her fav'rite Lock;                    115
  Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock.

This is an atom: 
To fifty chosen Sylphs, of special note,
  We trust th' important charge, the Petticoat:
  Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to fail,
  Tho' stiff with hoops, and arm'd with ribs of whale;           120
  Form a strong line about the silver bound,
  And guard the wide circumference around.

This is an atom: 
Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,
  His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,
  Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,             125
  Be stopp'd in vials, or transfix'd with pins;
  Or plung'd in lakes of bitter washes lie,
  Or wedg'd whole ages in a bodkin's eye:
  Gums and Pomatums shall his flight restrain,
  While clogg'd he beats his silken wings in vain;               130
  Or Alum styptics with contracting pow'r
  Shrink his thin essence like a rivel'd flow'r:
  Or, as Ixion fix'd, the wretch shall feel
  The giddy motion of the whirling Mill,
  In fumes of burning Chocolate shall glow,                      135
  And tremble at the sea that froths below!

This is an atom: 
He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend;
  Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend;
  Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair;
  Some hang upon the pendants of her ear:                        140
  With beating hearts the dire event they wait,
  Anxious, and trembling for the birth of Fate.

CANTO III

This is an atom: 
Close by those meads, for ever crown'd with flow'rs,
  Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs,
  There stands a structure of majestic frame,
  Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name.
  Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom                   5
  Of foreign Tyrants and of Nymphs at home;
  Here thou, great ANNA! whom three realms obey.
  Dost sometimes counsel take--and sometimes Tea.

This is an atom: 
Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort,
  To taste awhile the pleasures of a Court;                       10
  In various talk th' instructive hours they past,
  Who gave the ball, or paid the visit last;
  One speaks the glory of the British Queen,
  And one describes a charming Indian screen;
  A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;                    15
  At ev'ry word a reputation dies.
  Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,
  With singing, laughing, ogling, and _all that_.

This is an atom: 
Mean while, declining from the noon of day,
  The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;                       20
  The hungry Judges soon the sentence sign,
  And wretches hang that jury-men may dine;
  The merchant from th' Exchange returns in peace,
  And the long labours of the Toilet cease.
  Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites,                       25
  Burns to encounter two advent'rous Knights,
  At Ombre singly to decide their doom;
  And swells her breast with conquests yet to come.
  Straight the three bands prepare in arms to join,
  Each band the number of the sacred nine.                        30

This is an atom: 
Soon as she spreads her hand, th' aÃ«rial guard
  Descend, and sit on each important card:
  First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore,
  Then each, according to the rank they bore;
  For Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,                  35
  Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place.
  Behold, four Kings in majesty rever'd,
  With hoary whiskers and a forky beard;
  And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow'r,
  Th' expressive emblem of their softer pow'r;                    40
  Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band,
  Caps on their heads, and halberts in their hand;
  And particolour'd troops, a shining train,
  Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain.

This is an atom: 
The skilful Nymph reviews her force with care:                  45
  Let Spades be trumps! she said, and trumps they were.

This is an atom: 
Now move to war her sable Matadores,
  In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors.
  Spadillio first, unconquerable Lord!
  Led off two captive trumps, and swept the board.                50
  As many more Manillio forc'd to yield,
  And march'd a victor from the verdant field.
  Him Basto follow'd, but his fate more hard
  Gain'd but one trump and one Plebeian card.
  With his broad sabre next, a chief in years,                    55
  The hoary Majesty of Spades appears,
  Puts forth one manly leg, to sight reveal'd,
  The rest, his many-colour'd robe conceal'd.
  The rebel Knave, who dares his prince engage,
  Proves the just victim of his royal rage.                       60
  Ev'n mighty Pam, that Kings and Queens o'erthrew
  And mow'd down armies in the fights of Lu,
  Sad chance of war! now destitute of aid,
  Falls undistinguish'd by the victor spade!

This is an atom: 
Thus far both armies to Belinda yield;                          65
  Now to the Baron fate inclines the field.
  His warlike Amazon her host invades,
  Th' imperial consort of the crown of Spades.
  The Club's black Tyrant first her victim dy'd,
  Spite of his haughty mien, and barb'rous pride:                 70
  What boots the regal circle on his head,
  His giant limbs, in state unwieldy spread;
  That long behind he trails his pompous robe,
  And, of all monarchs, only grasps the globe?

This is an atom: 
The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace;                         75
  Th' embroider'd King who shows but half his face,
  And his refulgent Queen, with pow'rs combin'd
  Of broken troops an easy conquest find.
  Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, in wild disorder seen,
  With throngs promiscuous strow the level green.                 80
  Thus when dispers'd a routed army runs,
  Of Asia's troops, and Afric's sable sons,
  With like confusion different nations fly,
  Of various habit, and of various dye,
  The pierc'd battalions dis-united fall,                         85
  In heaps on heaps; one fate o'erwhelms them all.

This is an atom: 
The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts,
  And wins (oh shameful chance!) the Queen of Hearts.
  At this, the blood the virgin's cheek forsook,
  A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look;                     90
  She sees, and trembles at th' approaching ill,
  Just in the jaws of ruin, and Codille.
  And now (as oft in some distemper'd State)
  On one nice Trick depends the gen'ral fate.
  An Ace of Hearts steps forth: The King unseen                   95
  Lurk'd in her hand, and mourn'd his captive Queen:
  He springs to Vengeance with an eager pace,
  And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace.
  The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky;
  The walls, the woods, and long canals reply.                   100

This is an atom: 
Oh thoughtless mortals! ever blind to fate,
  Too soon dejected, and too soon elate.
  Sudden, these honours shall be snatch'd away,
  And curs'd for ever this victorious day.

This is an atom: 
For lo! the board with cups and spoons is crown'd,             105
  The berries crackle, and the mill turns round;
  On shining Altars of Japan they raise
  The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze:
  From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,
  While China's earth receives the smoking tide:                 110
  At once they gratify their scent and taste,
  And frequent cups prolong the rich repast.
  Straight hover round the Fair her airy band;
  Some, as she sipp'd, the fuming liquor fann'd,
  Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd,              115
  Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.
  Coffee, (which makes the politician wise,
  And see thro' all things with his half-shut eyes)
  Sent up in vapours to the Baron's brain
  New Stratagems, the radiant Lock to gain.                      120
  Ah cease, rash youth! desist ere't is too late,
  Fear the just Gods, and think of Scylla's Fate!
  Chang'd to a bird, and sent to flit in air,
  She dearly pays for Nisus' injur'd hair!

This is an atom: 
But when to mischief mortals bend their will,                  125
  How soon they find fit instruments of ill!
  Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace
  A two-edg'd weapon from her shining case:
  So Ladies in Romance assist their Knight,
  Present the spear, and arm him for the fight.                  130
  He takes the gift with rev'rence, and extends
  The little engine on his fingers' ends;
  This just behind Belinda's neck he spread,
  As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head.
  Swift to the Lock a thousand Sprites repair,                   135
  A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair;
  And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear;
  Thrice she look'd back, and thrice the foe drew near.
  Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought
  The close recesses of the Virgin's thought;                    140
  As on the nosegay in her breast reclin'd,
  He watch'd th' Ideas rising in her mind,
  Sudden he view'd, in spite of all her art,
  An earthly Lover lurking at her heart.
  Amaz'd, confus'd, he found his pow'r expir'd,                  145
  Resign'd to fate, and with a sigh retir'd.

This is an atom: 
The Peer now spreads the glitt'ring Forfex wide,
  T' inclose the Lock; now joins it, to divide.
  Ev'n then, before the fatal engine clos'd,
  A wretched Sylph too fondly interpos'd;                        150
  Fate urg'd the shears, and cut the Sylph in twain,
  (But airy substance soon unites again)
  The meeting points the sacred hair dissever
  From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!

This is an atom: 
Then flash'd the living lightning from her eyes,               155
  And screams of horror rend th' affrighted skies.
  Not louder shrieks to pitying heav'n are cast,
  When husbands, or when lapdogs breathe their last;
  Or when rich China vessels fall'n from high,
  In glitt'ring dust and painted fragments lie!                  160

This is an atom: 
Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine
  (The victor cry'd) the glorious Prize is mine!
  While fish in streams, or birds delight in air,
  Or in a coach and six the British Fair,
  As long as Atalantis shall be read,                            165
  Or the small pillow grace a Lady's bed,
  While visits shall be paid on solemn days,
  When num'rous wax-lights in bright order blaze,
  While nymphs take treats, or assignations give,
  So long my honour, name, and praise shall live!                170
  What Time would spare, from Steel receives its date,
  And monuments, like men, submit to fate!
  Steel could the labour of the Gods destroy,
  And strike to dust th' imperial tow'rs of Troy;
  Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,                175
  And hew triumphal arches to the ground.
  What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs should feel,
  The conqu'ring force of unresisted steel?

This is an atom: 
CANTO IV

This is an atom: 
But anxious cares the pensive nymph oppress'd,
  And secret passions labour'd in her breast.
  Not youthful kings in battle seiz'd alive,
  Not scornful virgins who their charms survive,
  Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss,                     5
  Not ancient ladies when refus'd a kiss,
  Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die,
  Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinn'd awry,
  E'er felt such rage, resentment, and despair,
  As thou, sad Virgin! for thy ravish'd Hair.                     10

This is an atom: 
For, that sad moment, when the Sylphs withdrew
  And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew,
  Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite,
  As ever sully'd the fair face of light,
  Down to the central earth, his proper scene,                    15
  Repair'd to search the gloomy Cave of Spleen.

This is an atom: 
Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome,
  And in a vapour reach'd the dismal dome.
  No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows,
  The dreaded East is all the wind that blows.                    20
  Here in a grotto, shelter'd close from air,
  And screen'd in shades from day's detested glare,
  She sighs for ever on her pensive bed,
  Pain at her side, and Megrim at her head.

This is an atom: 
Two handmaids wait the throne: alike in place,                  25
  But diff'ring far in figure and in face.
  Here stood Ill-nature like an ancient maid,
  Her wrinkled form in black and white array'd;
  With store of pray'rs, for mornings, nights, and noons,
  Her hand is fill'd; her bosom with lampoons.                    30

This is an atom: 
There Affectation, with a sickly mien,
  Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen,
  Practis'd to lisp, and hang the head aside.
  Faints into airs, and languishes with pride,
  On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,                      35
  Wrapt in a gown, for sickness, and for show.
  The fair ones feel such maladies as these,
  When each new night-dress gives a new disease.

This is an atom: 
A constant Vapour o'er the palace flies;
  Strange phantoms rising as the mists arise;                     40
  Dreadful, as hermit's dreams in haunted shades,
  Or bright, as visions of expiring maids.
  Now glaring fiends, and snakes on rolling spires,
  Pale spectres, gaping tombs, and purple fires:
  Now lakes of liquid gold, Elysian scenes,                       45
  And crystal domes, and angels in machines.

This is an atom: 
Unnumber'd throngs on every side are seen,
  Of bodies chang'd to various forms by Spleen.
  Here living Tea-pots stand, one arm held out,
  One bent; the handle this, and that the spout:                  50
  A Pipkin there, like Homer's Tripod walks;
  Here sighs a Jar, and there a Goose-pie talks;
  Men prove with child, as pow'rful fancy works,
  And maids turn'd bottles, call aloud for corks.

This is an atom: 
Safe past the Gnome thro' this fantastic band,                  55
  A branch of healing Spleenwort in his hand.
  Then thus address'd the pow'r: "Hail, wayward Queen!
  Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen:
  Parent of vapours and of female wit,
  Who give th' hysteric, or poetic fit,                           60
  On various tempers act by various ways,
  Make some take physic, others scribble plays;
  Who cause the proud their visits to delay,
  And send the godly in a pet to pray.
  A nymph there is, that all thy pow'r disdains,                  65
  And thousands more in equal mirth maintains.
  But oh! if e'er thy Gnome could spoil a grace,
  Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face,
  Like Citron-waters matrons cheeks inflame,
  Or change complexions at a losing game;                         70
  If e'er with airy horns I planted heads,
  Or rumpled petticoats, or tumbled beds,
  Or caus'd suspicion when no soul was rude,
  Or discompos'd the head-dress of a Prude,
  Or e'er to costive lap-dog gave disease,                        75
  Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease:
  Hear me, and touch Belinda with chagrin,
  That single act gives half the world the spleen."

This is an atom: 
The Goddess with a discontented air
  Seems to reject him, tho' she grants his pray'r.                80
  A wond'rous Bag with both her hands she binds,
  Like that where once Ulysses held the winds;
  There she collects the force of female lungs,
  Sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues.
  A Vial next she fills with fainting fears,                      85
  Soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears.
  The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away,
  Spreads his black wings, and slowly mounts to day.

This is an atom: 
Sunk in Thalestris' arms the nymph he found,
  Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound.                         90
  Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent,
  And all the Furies issu'd at the vent.
  Belinda burns with more than mortal ire,
  And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire.
  "O wretched maid!" she spread her hands, and cry'd,             95
  (While Hampton's echoes, "Wretched maid!" reply'd)
  "Was it for this you took such constant care
  The bodkin, comb, and essence to prepare?
  For this your locks in paper durance bound,
  For this with tort'ring irons wreath'd around?                 100
  For this with fillets strain'd your tender head,
  And bravely bore the double loads of lead?
  Gods! shall the ravisher display your hair,
  While the Fops envy, and the Ladies stare!
  Honour forbid! at whose unrivall'd shrine                      105
  Ease, pleasure, virtue, all our sex resign.
  Methinks already I your tears survey,
  Already hear the horrid things they say,
  Already see you a degraded toast,
  And all your honour in a whisper lost!                         110
  How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend?
  'T will then be infamy to seem your friend!
  And shall this prize, th' inestimable prize,
  Expos'd thro' crystal to the gazing eyes,
  And heighten'd by the diamond's circling rays,                 115
  On that rapacious hand for ever blaze?
  Sooner shall grass in Hyde-park Circus grow,
  And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow;
  Sooner let earth, air, sea, to Chaos fall,
  Men, monkeys, lap-dogs, parrots, perish all!"                  120

This is an atom: 
She said; then raging to Sir Plume repairs,
  And bids her Beau demand the precious hairs;
  (Sir Plume of amber snuff-box justly vain,
  And the nice conduct of a clouded cane)
  With earnest eyes, and round unthinking face,                  125
  He first the snuff-box open'd, then the case,
  And thus broke out--"My Lord, why, what the devil?
  "Z--ds! damn the lock! 'fore Gad, you must be civil!
  Plague on't!'t is past a jest--nay prithee, pox!
  Give her the hair"--he spoke, and rapp'd his box.              130

This is an atom: 
"It grieves me much" (reply'd the Peer again)
  "Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain.
  But by this Lock, this sacred Lock I swear,
  (Which never more shall join its parted hair;
  Which never more its honours shall renew,                      135
  Clipp'd from the lovely head where late it grew)
  That while my nostrils draw the vital air,
  This hand, which won it, shall for ever wear."
  He spoke, and speaking, in proud triumph spread
  The long-contended honours of her head.                        140

This is an atom: 
But Umbriel, hateful Gnome! forbears not so;
  He breaks the Vial whence the sorrows flow.
  Then see! the nymph in beauteous grief appears,
  Her eyes half-languishing, half-drown'd in tears;
  On her heav'd bosom hung her drooping head,                    145
  Which, with a sigh, she rais'd; and thus she said.
  "For ever curs'd be this detested day,
  Which snatch'd my best, my fav'rite curl away!
  Happy! ah ten times happy had I been,
  If Hampton-Court these eyes had never seen!                    150
  Yet am not I the first mistaken maid,
  By love of Courts to num'rous ills betray'd.
  Oh had I rather un-admir'd remain'd
  In some lone isle, or distant Northern land;
  Where the gilt Chariot never marks the way,                    155
  Where none learn Ombre, none e'er taste Bohea!
  There kept my charms conceal'd from mortal eye,
  Like roses, that in deserts bloom and die.
  What mov'd my mind with youthful Lords to roam?
  Oh had I stay'd, and said my pray'rs at home!                  160
  'T was this, the morning omens seem'd to tell,
  Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell;
  The tott'ring China shook without a wind.
  Nay, Poll sat mute, and Shock was most unkind!
  A Sylph too warn'd me of the threats of fate,                  165
  In mystic visions, now believ'd too late!
  See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs!
  My hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares:
  These in two sable ringlets taught to break,
  Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck;                      170
  The sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone,
  And in its fellow's fate foresees its own;
  Uncurl'd it hangs, the fatal shears demands,
  And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands.
  Oh hadst thou, cruel! been content to seize                    175
  Hairs less in sight, or any hairs but these!"

This is an atom: 
She said: the pitying audience melt in tears.
  But Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron's ears.
  In vain Thalestris with reproach assails,
  For who can move when fair Belinda fails?
  Not half so fix'd the Trojan could remain,                       5
  While Anna begg'd and Dido rag'd in vain.
  Then grave Clarissa graceful wav'd her fan;
  Silence ensu'd, and thus the nymph began.

This is an atom: 
"Say why are Beauties prais'd and honour'd most,
  The wise man's passion, and the vain man's toast?               10
  Why deck'd with all that land and sea afford,
  Why Angels call'd, and Angel-like ador'd?
  Why round our coaches crowd the white-glov'd Beaux,
  Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows;
  How vain are all these glories, all our pains,                  15
  Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains:
  That men may say, when we the front-box grace:
  'Behold the first in virtue as in face!'
  Oh! if to dance all night, and dress all day,
  Charm'd the small-pox, or chas'd old-age away;                  20
  Who would not scorn what housewife's cares produce,
  Or who would learn one earthly thing of use?
  To patch, nay ogle, might become a Saint,
  Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint.
  But since, alas! frail beauty must decay,                       25
  Curl'd or uncurl'd, since Locks will turn to grey;
  Since painted, or not painted, all shall fade,
  And she who scorns a man, must die a maid;
  What then remains but well our pow'r to use,
  And keep good-humour still whate'er we lose?                    30
  And trust me, dear! good-humour can prevail,
  When airs, and flights, and screams, and scolding fail.
  Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll;
  Charms strike the sight, but merit wins the soul."

This is an atom: 
So spoke the Dame, but no applause ensu'd;                      35
  Belinda frown'd, Thalestris call'd her Prude.
  "To arms, to arms!" the fierce Virago cries,
  And swift as lightning to the combat flies.
  All side in parties, and begin th' attack;
  Fans clap, silks rustle, and tough whalebones crack;            40
  Heroes' and Heroines' shouts confus'dly rise,
  And bass, and treble voices strike the skies.
  No common weapons in their hands are found,
  Like Gods they fight, nor dread a mortal wound.

This is an atom: 
So when bold Homer makes the Gods engage,                       45
  And heav'nly breasts with human passions rage;
  'Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes arms;
  And all Olympus rings with loud alarms:
  Jove's thunder roars, heav'n trembles all around,
  Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps resound:               50
  Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs, the ground gives way.
  And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day!

This is an atom: 
Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height
  Clapp'd his glad wings, and sate to view the fight:
  Propp'd on the bodkin spears, the Sprites survey                55
  The growing combat, or assist the fray.

This is an atom: 
While thro' the press enrag'd Thalestris flies,
  And scatters death around from both her eyes,
  A Beau and Witling perish'd in the throng,
  One died in metaphor, and one in song.                          60
  "O cruel nymph! a living death I bear,"
  Cry'd Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair.
  A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast,
  "Those eyes are made so killing"--was his last.
  Thus on MÃ¦ander's flow'ry margin lies                           65
  Th' expiring Swan, and as he sings he dies.

This is an atom: 
When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down,
  Chloe stepp'd in, and kill'd him with a frown;
  She smil'd to see the doughty hero slain,
  But, at her smile, the Beau reviv'd again.                      70

This is an atom: 
Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air,
  Weighs the Men's wits against the Lady's hair;
  The doubtful beam long nods from side to side;
  At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside.

This is an atom: 
See, fierce Belinda on the Baron flies,                         75
  With more than usual lightning in her eyes:
  Nor fear'd the Chief th' unequal fight to try,
  Who sought no more than on his foe to die.
  But this bold Lord with manly strength endu'd,
  She with one finger and a thumb subdu'd:                        80
  Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew,
  A charge of Snuff the wily virgin threw;
  The Gnomes direct, to ev'ry atom just,
  The pungent grains of titillating dust.
  Sudden, with starting tears each eye o'erflows,                 85
  And the high dome re-echoes to his nose.

This is an atom: 
Now meet thy fate, incens'd Belinda cry'd,
  And drew a deadly bodkin from her side.
  (The same, his ancient personage to deck,
  Her great great grandsire wore about his neck,                  90
  In three seal-rings; which after, melted down,
  Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's gown:
  Her infant grandame's whistle next it grew,
  The bells she jingled, and the whistle blew;
  Then in a bodkin grac'd her mother's hairs,                     95
  Which long she wore, and now Belinda wears.)

This is an atom: 
"Boast not my fall" (he cry'd) "insulting foe!
  Thou by some other shalt be laid as low,
  Nor think, to die dejects my lofty mind:
  All that I dread is leaving you behind!                        100
  Rather than so, ah let me still survive,
  And burn in Cupid's flames--but burn alive."

This is an atom: 
"Restore the Lock!" she cries; and all around
  "Restore the Lock!" the vaulted roofs rebound.
  Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain                         105
  Roar'd for the handkerchief that caus'd his pain.
  But see how oft ambitious aims are cross'd,
  And chiefs contend 'till all the prize is lost!
  The Lock, obtain'd with guilt, and kept with pain,
  In ev'ry place is sought, but sought in vain:                  110
  With such a prize no mortal must be blest,
  So heav'n decrees! with heav'n who can contest?

This is an atom: 
Some thought it mounted to the Lunar sphere,
  Since all things lost on earth are treasur'd there.
  There Hero's wits are kept in pond'rous vases,                 115
  And beau's in snuff-boxes and tweezer-cases.
  There broken vows and death-bed alms are found,
  And lovers' hearts with ends of riband bound,
  The courtier's promises, and sick man's pray'rs,
  The smiles of harlots, and the tears of heirs,                 120
  Cages for gnats, and chains to yoke a flea,
  Dry'd butterflies, and tomes of casuistry.

This is an atom: 
But trust the Muse--she saw it upward rise,
  Tho' mark'd by none but quick, poetic eyes:
  (So Rome's great founder to the heav'ns withdrew,              125
  To Proculus alone confess'd in view)
  A sudden Star, it shot thro' liquid air,
  And drew behind a radiant trail of hair.
  Not Berenice's Locks first rose so bright,
  The heav'ns bespangling with dishevell'd light.                130
  The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies,
  And pleas'd pursue its progress thro' the skies.

This is an atom: 
This the Beau monde shall from the Mall survey,
  And hail with music its propitious ray.
  This the blest Lover shall for Venus take,                     135
  And send up vows from Rosamonda's lake.
  This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies,
  When next he looks thro' Galileo's eyes;
  And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom
  The fate of Louis, and the fall of Rome.                       140

This is an atom: 
Then cease, bright Nymph! to mourn thy ravish'd hair,
  Which adds new glory to the shining sphere!
  Not all the tresses that fair head can boast,
  Shall draw such envy as the Lock you lost.
  For, after all the murders of your eye,                        145
  When, after millions slain, yourself shall die:
  When those fair suns shall set, as set they must,
  And all those tresses shall be laid in dust,
  This Lock, the Muse shall consecrate to fame,
  And 'midst the stars inscribe Belinda's name.                  150

This is an atom: 
AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM

This is an atom: 
'Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill
  Appear in writing or in judging ill;
  But, of the two, less dang'rous is th' offence
  To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.
  Some few in that, but numbers err in this,                         5
  Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss;
  A fool might once himself alone expose,
  Now one in verse makes many more in prose.

This is an atom: 
'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none
  Go just alike, yet each believes his own.                         10
  In Poets as true genius is but rare,
  True Taste as seldom is the Critic's share;
  Both must alike from Heav'n derive their light,
  These born to judge, as well as those to write.
  Let such teach others who themselves excel,                       15
  And censure freely who have written well.
  Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true,
  But are not Critics to their judgment too?

This is an atom: 
Yet if we look more closely, we shall find
  Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind:                    20
  Nature affords at least a glimm'ring light;
  The lines, tho' touch'd but faintly, are drawn right.
  But as the slightest sketch, if justly trac'd,  }
  Is by ill-colouring but the more disgrac'd,     }
  So by false learning is good sense defac'd:     }                 25
  Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools,
  And some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools.

This is an atom: 
In search of wit these lose their common sense,
  And then turn Critics in their own defence:
  Each burns alike, who can, or cannot write,                       30
  Or with a Rival's, or an Eunuch's spite.
  All fools have still an itching to deride,
  And fain would be upon the laughing side.
  If MÃ¦vius scribble in Apollo's spite,
  There are who judge still worse than he can write.                35

This is an atom: 
Some have at first for Wits, then Poets past,
  Turn'd Critics next, and prov'd plain fools at last.
  Some neither can for Wits nor Critics pass,
  As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass.
  Those half-learn'd witlings, num'rous in our isle,                40
  As half-form'd insects on the banks of Nile;
  Unfinish'd things, one knows not what to call,
  Their generation's so equivocal:
  To tell 'em, would a hundred tongues require,
  Or one vain wit's, that might a hundred tire.                     45

This is an atom: 
But you who seek to give and merit fame,
  And justly bear a Critic's noble name,
  Be sure yourself and your own reach to know,
  How far your genius, taste, and learning go;
  Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet,                    50
  And mark that point where sense and dulness meet.

This is an atom: 
Nature to all things fix'd the limits fit,
  And wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit.
  As on the land while here the ocean gains,
  In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains;                       55
  Thus in the soul while memory prevails,
  The solid pow'r of understanding fails;
  Where beams of warm imagination play,
  The memory's soft figures melt away.
  One science only will one genius fit;                             60
  So vast is art, so narrow human wit:
  Not only bounded to peculiar arts,
  But oft in those confin'd to single parts.
  Like kings we lose the conquests gain'd before,
  By vain ambition still to make them more;                         65
  Each might his sev'ral province well command,
  Would all but stoop to what they understand.

This is an atom: 
First follow Nature, and your judgment frame
  By her just standard, which is still the same:
  Unerring NATURE, still divinely bright,                           70
  One clear, unchang'd, and universal light,
  Life, force, and beauty, must to all impart,
  At once the source, and end, and test of Art.
  Art from that fund each just supply provides,
  Works without show, and without pomp presides:                    75
  In some fair body thus th' informing soul
  With spirits feeds, with vigour fills the whole,
  Each motion guides, and ev'ry nerve sustains;
  Itself unseen, but in th' effects, remains.
  Some, to whom Heav'n in wit has been profuse,                     80
  Want as much more, to turn it to its use;
  For wit and judgment often are at strife,
  Tho' meant each other's aid, like man and wife.
  'T is more to guide, than spur the Muse's steed;
  Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed;                        85
  The winged courser, like a gen'rous horse,
  Shows most true mettle when you check his course.

This is an atom: 
Those RULES of old discovered, not devis'd,
  Are Nature still, but Nature methodiz'd;
  Nature, like liberty, is but restrain'd                           90
  By the same laws which first herself ordain'd.

This is an atom: 
Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites,
  When to repress, and when indulge our flights:
  High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd,
  And pointed out those arduous paths they trod;                    95
  Held from afar, aloft, th' immortal prize,
  And urg'd the rest by equal steps to rise.
  Just precepts thus from great examples giv'n,
  She drew from them what they deriv'd from Heav'n.
  The gen'rous Critic fann'd the Poet's fire,                      100
  And taught the world with reason to admire.
  Then Criticism the Muse's handmaid prov'd,
  To dress her charms, and make her more belov'd:
  But following wits from that intention stray'd,
  Who could not win the mistress, woo'd the maid;                  105
  Against the Poets their own arms they turn'd,
  Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd.
  So modern 'Pothecaries, taught the art
  By Doctor's bills to play the Doctor's part,
  Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,                          110
  Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.
  Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey,
  Nor time nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they.
  Some drily plain, without invention's aid,
  Write dull receipts how poems may be made.                       115
  These leave the sense, their learning to display,
  And those explain the meaning quite away.

This is an atom: 
You then whose judgment the right course would steer,
  Know well each ANCIENT'S proper character;
  His fable, subject, scope in ev'ry page;                         120
  Religion, Country, genius of his Age:
  Without all these at once before your eyes,
  Cavil you may, but never criticize.
  Be Homer's works your study and delight,
  Read them by day, and meditate by night;                         125
  Thence form your judgment, thence your maxims bring,
  And trace the Muses upward to their spring.
  Still with itself compar'd, his text peruse;
  And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse.

This is an atom: 
When first young Maro in his boundless mind                      130
  A work t' outlast immortal Rome design'd,
  Perhaps he seem'd above the critic's law,
  And but from Nature's fountains scorn'd to draw:
  But when t' examine ev'ry part he came,
  Nature and Homer were, he found, the same.                       135
  Convinc'd, amaz'd, he checks the bold design;
  And rules as strict his labour'd work confine,
  As if the Stagirite o'erlook'd each line.
  Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem;
  To copy nature is to copy them.                                  140

This is an atom: 
Some beauties yet no Precepts can declare,
  For there's a happiness as well as care.
  Music resembles Poetry, in each
  Are nameless graces which no methods teach,
  And which a master-hand alone can reach.                         145
  If, where the rules not far enough extend,
  (Since rules were made but to promote their end)
  Some lucky Licence answer to the full
  Th' intent propos'd, that Licence is a rule.
  Thus Pegasus, a nearer way to take,                              150
  May boldly deviate from the common track;
  From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part,
  And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,
  Which without passing thro' the judgment, gains
  The heart, and all its end at once attains.                      155
  In prospects thus, some objects please our eyes,
  Which out of nature's common order rise,
  The shapeless rock, or hanging precipice.
  Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend,
  And rise to faults true Critics dare not mend.                  160
  But tho' the Ancients thus their rules invade,
  (As Kings dispense with laws themselves have made)
  Moderns, beware! or if you must offend
  Against the precept, ne'er transgress its End;
  Let it be seldom, and compell'd by need;                        165
  And have, at least, their precedent to plead.
  The Critic else proceeds without remorse,
  Seizes your fame, and puts his laws in force.
  I know there are, to whose presumptuous thoughts
  Those freer beauties, ev'n in them, seem faults.                170
  Some figures monstrous and mis-shap'd appear,
  Consider'd singly, or beheld too near,
  Which, but proportion'd to their light, or place,
  Due distance reconciles to form and grace.
  A prudent chief not always must display                         175
  His pow'rs in equal ranks, and fair array.
  But with th' occasion and the place comply,
  Conceal his force, nay seem sometimes to fly.
  Those oft are stratagems which error seem,
  Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.                        180

Still green with bays each ancient Altar stands,
  Above the reach of sacrilegious hands;
  Secure from Flames, from Envy's fiercer rage,
  Destructive War, and all-involving Age.
  See, from each clime the learn'd their incense bring!           185
  Hear, in all tongues consenting PÃ¦ans ring!
  In praise so just let ev'ry voice be join'd,
  And fill the gen'ral chorus of mankind.
  Hail, Bards triumphant! born in happier days;
  Immortal heirs of universal praise!                             190
  Whose honours with increase of ages grow,
  As streams roll down, enlarging as they flow;
  Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound,
  And worlds applaud that must not yet be found!
  Oh may some spark of your celestial fire,                       195
  The last, the meanest of your sons inspire,
  (That on weak wings, from far, pursues your flights;
  Glows while he reads, but trembles as he writes)
  To teach vain Wits a science little known,
  T' admire superior sense, and doubt their own!                  200

This is an atom: 
Of all the Causes which conspire to blind
  Man's erring judgment, and misguide the mind,
  What the weak head with strongest bias rules,
  Is _Pride_, the never-failing voice of fools.
  Whatever nature has in worth denied,                            205
  She gives in large recruits of needful pride;
  For as in bodies, thus in souls, we find
  What wants in blood and spirits, swell'd with wind:
  Pride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence,
  And fills up all the mighty Void of sense.                      210
  If once right reason drives that cloud away,
  Truth breaks upon us with resistless day.
  Trust not yourself; but your defects to know,
  Make use of ev'ry friend--and ev'ry foe.

A _little learning_ is a dang'rous thing;                       215
  Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.
  There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,
  And drinking largely sobers us again.
  Fir'd at first sight with what the Muse imparts,
  In fearless youth we tempt the heights of Arts,                 220
  While from the bounded level of our mind
  Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind;
  But more advanc'd, behold with strange surprise
  New distant scenes of endless science rise!
  So pleas'd at first the tow'ring Alps we try,                   225
  Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky,
  Th' eternal snows appear already past,
  And the first clouds and mountains seem the last;
  But, those attain'd, we tremble to survey
  The growing labours of the lengthen'd way,                      230
  Th' increasing prospect tires our wand'ring eyes,
  Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise!

A perfect Judge will read each work of Wit
  With the same spirit that its author writ:
  Survey the WHOLE, nor seek slight faults to find                235
  Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind;
  Nor lose, for that malignant dull delight,
  The gen'rous pleasure to be charm'd with Wit.
  But in such lays as neither ebb, nor flow,
  Correctly cold, and regularly low,                              240
  That shunning faults, one quiet tenour keep,
  We cannot blame indeed--but we may sleep.
  In wit, as nature, what affects our hearts
  Is not th' exactness of peculiar parts;
  'Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call,                         245
  But the joint force and full result of all.
  Thus when we view some well-proportion'd dome,
  (The world's just wonder, and ev'n thine, O Rome!)
  No single parts unequally surprize,
  All comes united to th' admiring eyes;                          250
  No monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear;
  The Whole at once is bold, and regular.

This is an atom: 
Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,
  Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.
  In every work regard the writer's End,                          255
  Since none can compass more than they intend;
  And if the means be just, the conduct true,
  Applause, in spight of trivial faults, is due;
  As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit,
  T' avoid great errors, must the less commit:                    260
  Neglect the rules each verbal Critic lays,
  For not to know some trifles, is a praise.
  Most Critics, fond of some subservient art,
  Still make the Whole depend upon a Part:
  They talk of principles, but notions prize,                     265
  And all to one lov'd Folly sacrifice.

This is an atom: 
Once on a time, La Mancha's Knight, they say,
  A certain bard encount'ring on the way,
  Discours'd in terms as just, with looks as sage,
  As e'er could Dennis of the Grecian stage;                      270
  Concluding all were desp'rate sots and fools,
  Who durst depart from Aristotle's rules.
  Our Author, happy in a judge so nice,
  Produc'd his Play, and begg'd the Knight's advice;
  Made him observe the subject, and the plot,                     275
  The manners, passions, unities; what not?
  All which, exact to rule, were brought about,
  Were but a Combat in the lists left out.
  "What! leave the Combat out?" exclaims the Knight;
  Yes, or we must renounce the Stagirite.                         280
  "Not so, by Heav'n" (he answers in a rage),
  "Knights, squires, and steeds, must enter on the stage."
  So vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain.
  "Then build a new, or act it in a plain."

This is an atom: 
Thus Critics, of less judgment than caprice,                    285
  Curious not knowing, not exact but nice,
  Form short Ideas; and offend in arts
  (As most in manners) by a love to parts.

This is an atom: 
Some to _Conceit_ alone their taste confine,
  And glitt'ring thoughts struck out at ev'ry line;               290
  Pleas'd with a work where nothing's just or fit;
  One glaring Chaos and wild heap of wit.
  Poets like painters, thus, unskill'd to trace
  The naked nature and the living grace,
  With gold and jewels cover ev'ry part,                          295
  And hide with ornaments their want of art.
  True Wit is Nature to advantage dress'd,
  What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd;
  Something, whose truth convinc'd at sight we find,
  That gives us back the image of our mind.                       300
  As shades more sweetly recommend the light,
  So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit.
  For works may have more wit than does 'em good,
  As bodies perish thro' excess of blood.

This is an atom: 
Others for Language all their care express,                     305
  And value books, as women men, for Dress:
  Their praise is still--the Style is excellent:
  The Sense, they humbly take upon content.
  Words are like leaves; and where they most abound,
  Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found,                    310
  False Eloquence, like the prismatic glass,
  Its gaudy colours spreads on ev'ry place;
  The face of Nature we no more survey,
  All glares alike, without distinction gay:
  But true expression, like th' unchanging Sun,                   315
  Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon,
  It gilds all objects, but it alters none.
  Expression is the dress of thought, and still
  Appears more decent, as more suitable;
  A vile conceit in pompous words express'd,                      320
  Is like a clown in regal purple dress'd:
  For diff'rent styles with diff'rent subjects sort,
  As several garbs with country, town, and court.

This is an atom: 
Some by old words to fame have made pretence,
  Ancients in phrase, mere moderns in their sense;                325
  Such labour'd nothings, in so strange a style,
  Amaze th' unlearn'd, and make the learned smile.
  Unlucky, as Fungoso in the play,          }
  These sparks with awkward vanity display  }
  What the fine gentleman wore yesterday;   }                     330
  And but so mimic ancient wits at best,
  As apes our grandsires, in their doublets drest.
  In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold;
  Alike fantastic, if too new, or old:
  Be not the first by whom the new are try'd,                     335
  Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.

This is an atom: 
But most by Numbers judge a Poet's song;
  And smooth or rough, with them is right or wrong:
  In the bright Muse though thousand charms conspire,
  Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire;                    340
  Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear,     }
  Not mend their minds; as some to Church repair,  }
  Not for the doctrine, but the music there.       }
  These equal syllables alone require,
  Tho' oft the ear the open vowe's tire;                          345
  While expletives their feeble aid do join;
  And ten low words oft creep in one dull line:
  While they ring round the same unvary'd chimes,
  With sure returns of still expected rhymes;
  Where-e'er you find "the cooling western breeze,"               350
  In the next line, it "whispers through the trees:"
  If crystal streams "with pleasing murmurs creep,"
  The reader's threaten'd (not in vain) with "sleep:"
  Then, at the last and only couplet fraught
  With some unmeaning thing they call a thought,                  355
  A needless Alexandrine ends the song
  That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.
  Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know
  What's roundly smooth or languishingly slow;
  And praise the easy vigour of a line,                           360
  Where Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join.
  True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,
  As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance.
  'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence,
  The sound must seem an Echo to the sense:                       365
  Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows,
  And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;
  But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,
  The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar:
  When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,             370
  The line too labours, and the words move slow;
  Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,
  Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main.
  Hear how Timotheus' varied lays surprize,
  And bid alternate passions fall and rise!                       375
  While, at each change, the son of Libyan Jove
  Now burns with glory, and then melts with love,
  Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow,
  Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow:
  Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found,                 380
  And the world's victor stood subdu'd by Sound!
  The pow'r of Music all our hearts allow,
  And what Timotheus was, is DRYDEN now.

This is an atom: 
Avoid Extremes; and shun the fault of such,
  Who still are pleas'd too little or too much.                   385
  At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence,
  That always shows great pride, or little sense;
  Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best,
  Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest.
  Yet let not each gay Turn thy rapture move;                     390
  For fools admire, but men of sense approve:
  As things seem large which we thro' mists descry,
  Dulness is ever apt to magnify.

This is an atom: 
Some foreign writers, some our own despise;
  The Ancients only, or the Moderns prize.                        395
  Thus Wit, like Faith, by each man is apply'd
  To one small sect, and all are damn'd beside.
  Meanly they seek the blessing to confine,
  And force that sun but on a part to shine,
  Which not alone the southern wit sublimes,                      400
  But ripens spirits in cold northern climes;
  Which from the first has shone on ages past,
  Enlights the present, and shall warm the last;
  Tho' each may feel increases and decays,
  And see now clearer and now darker days.                        405
  Regard not then if Wit be old or new,
  But blame the false, and value still the true.

This is an atom: 
Some ne'er advance a Judgment of their own,
  But catch the spreading notion of the Town;
  They reason and conclude by precedent,                          410
  And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent.
  Some judge of author's names, not works, and then
  Nor praise nor blame the writings, but the men.
  Of all this servile herd the worst is he
  That in proud dulness joins with Quality,                       415
  A constant Critic at the great man's board,
  To fetch and carry nonsense for my Lord.
  What woful stuff this madrigal would be,
  In some starv'd hackney sonneteer, or me?
  But let a Lord once own the happy lines,                        420
  How the wit brightens! how the style refines!
  Before his sacred name flies ev'ry fault,
  And each exalted stanza teems with thought!

This is an atom: 
The Vulgar thus through Imitation err;
  As oft the Learn'd by being singular;                           425
  So much they scorn the crowd, that if the throng
  By chance go right, they purposely go wrong;
  So Schismatics the plain believers quit,
  And are but damn'd for having too much wit.
  Some praise at morning what they blame at night;                430
  But always think the last opinion right.
  A Muse by these is like a mistress us'd,
  This hour she's idoliz'd, the next abus'd;
  While their weak heads like towns unfortify'd,
  'Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side.              435
  Ask them the cause; they're wiser still, they say;
  And still to-morrow's wiser than to-day.
  We think our fathers fools, so wise we grow,
  Our wiser sons, no doubt, will think us so.
  Once School-divines this zealous isle o'er-spread;              440
  Who knew most Sentences, was deepest read;
  Faith, Gospel, all, seem'd made to be disputed,
  And none had sense enough to be confuted:
  Scotists and Thomists, now, in peace remain,
  Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck-lane.                      445
  If Faith itself has diff'rent dresses worn,
  What wonder modes in Wit should take their turn?
  Oft', leaving what is natural and fit,
  The current folly proves the ready wit;
  And authors think their reputation safe,                       450
  Which lives as long as fools are pleas'd to laugh.
  Some valuing those of their own side or mind,
  Still make themselves the measure of mankind:
  Fondly we think we honour merit then,
  When we but praise ourselves in other men.                     455

This is an atom: 
Parties in Wit attend on those of State,
  And public faction doubles private hate.
  Pride, Malice, Folly, against Dryden rose,
  In various shapes of Parsons, Critics, Beaus;
  But sense surviv'd, when merry jests were past;                460
  For rising merit will buoy up at last.
  Might he return, and bless once more our eyes,
  New Blackmores and new Milbourns must arise:
  Nay should great Homer lift his awful head,
  Zoilus again would start up from the dead.                     465
  Envy will merit, as its shade, pursue;
  But like a shadow, proves the substance true;
  For envy'd Wit, like Sol eclips'd, makes known
  Th' opposing body's grossness, not its own,
  When first that sun too pow'rful beams displays,               470
  It draws up vapours which obscure its rays;
  But ev'n those clouds at last adorn its way,
  Reflect new glories, and augment the day.

This is an atom: 
Be thou the first true merit to befriend;
  His praise is lost, who stays, till all commend.               475
  Short is the date, alas, of modern rhymes,
  And 'tis but just to let them live betimes.
  No longer now that golden age appears,
  When Patriarch-wits surviv'd a thousand years:
  Now length of Fame (our second life) is lost,                  480
  And bare threescore is all ev'n that can boast;
  Our sons their fathers' failing language see,
  And such as Chaucer is, shall Dryden be.
  So when the faithful pencil has design'd
  Some bright Idea of the master's mind,                         485
  Where a new world leaps out at his command,
  And ready Nature waits upon his hand;
  When the ripe colours soften and unite,
  And sweetly melt into just shade and light;
  When mellowing years their full perfection give,               490
  And each bold figure just begins to live,
  The treach'rous colours the fair art betray,
  And all the bright creation fades away!

This is an atom: 
Unhappy Wit, like most mistaken things,
  Atones not for that envy which it brings.                      495
  In youth alone its empty praise we boast,
  But soon the short-liv'd vanity is lost:
  Like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies.
  That gaily blooms, but ev'n in blooming dies.
  What is this Wit, which must our cares employ?                 500
  The owner's wife, that other men enjoy;
  Then most our trouble still when most admir'd,
  And still the more we give, the more requir'd;
  Whose fame with pains we guard, but lose with ease,
  Sure some to vex, but never all to please;                     505
  'Tis what the vicious fear, the virtuous shun,
  By fools't is hated, and by knaves undone!

This is an atom: 
If Wit so much from Ign'rance undergo,
  Ah let not Learning too commence its foe!
  Of old, those met rewards who could excel,                     510
  And such were prais'd who but endeavour'd well:
  Tho' triumphs were to gen'rals only due,
  Crowns were reserv'd to grace the soldiers too,
  Now, they who reach Parnassus' lofty crown,
  Employ their pains to spurn some others down;                  515
  And while self-love each jealous writer rules,
  Contending wits become the sport of fools:
  But still the worst with most regret commend,
  For each ill Author is as bad a Friend.
  To what base ends, and by what abject ways,                    520
  Are mortals urg'd thro' sacred lust of praise!
  Ah ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast,
  Nor in the Critic let the Man be lost.
  Good-nature and good-sense must ever join;
  To err is human, to forgive, divine.                           525

This is an atom: 
But if in noble minds some dregs remain
  Not yet purg'd off, of spleen and sour disdain;
  Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes,
  Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times.
  No pardon vile Obscenity should find,                          530
  Tho' wit and art conspire to move your mind;
  But Dulness with Obscenity must prove
  As shameful sure as Impotence in love.
  In the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease
  Sprung the rank weed, and thriv'd with large increase:         535
  When love was all an easy Monarch's care;
  Seldom at council, never in a war:
  Jilts rul'd the state, and statesmen farces writ;
  Nay wits had pensions, and young Lords had wit:
  The Fair sate panting at a Courtier's play,                    540
  And not a Mask went unimprov'd away:
  The modest fan was lifted up no more,
  And Virgins smil'd at what they blush'd before.
  The following licence of a Foreign reign
  Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain;                       545
  Then unbelieving priests reform'd the nation,
  And taught more pleasant methods of salvation;
  Where Heav'n's free subjects might their rights dispute,
  Lest God himself should seem too absolute:
  Pulpits their sacred satire learn'd to spare,                  550
  And Vice admir'd to find a flatt'rer there!
  Encourag'd thus, Wit's Titans brav'd the skies,
  And the press groan'd with licens'd blasphemies.
  These monsters, Critics! with your darts engage,
  Here point your thunder, and exhaust your rage!                555
  Yet shun their fault, who, scandalously nice,
  Will needs mistake an author into vice;
  All seems infected that th' infected spy,
  As all looks yellow to the jaundic'd eye.

This is an atom: 
Learn then what MORALS Critics ought to show,                  560
  For't is but half a Judge's task, to know.
  'Tis not enough, taste, judgment, learning, join;
  In all you speak, let truth and candour shine:
  That not alone what to your sense is due
  All may allow; but seek your friendship too.                   565

This is an atom: 
Be silent always when you doubt your sense;
  And speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence:
  Some positive, persisting fops we know,
  Who, if once wrong, will needs be always so;
  But you, with pleasure own your errors past,                   570
  And make each day a Critic on the last.

This is an atom: 
'T is not enough, your counsel still be true;
  Blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do;
  Men must be taught as if you taught them not,
  And things unknown propos'd as things forgot.                  575
  Without Good Breeding, truth is disapprov'd;
  That only makes superior sense belov'd.

This is an atom: 
Be niggards of advice on no pretence;
  For the worst avarice is that of sense.
  With mean complacence ne'er betray your trust,                 580
  Nor be so civil as to prove unjust.
  Fear not the anger of the wise to raise;
  Those best can bear reproof, who merit praise.

This is an atom: 
'T were well might critics still this freedom take,
  But Appius reddens at each word you speak,                     585
  And stares, tremendous, with a threat'ning eye,
  Like some fierce Tyrant in old tapestry.
  Fear most to tax an Honourable fool,
  Whose right it is, uncensur'd, to be dull;
  Such, without wit, are Poets when they please,                 590
  As without learning they can take Degrees.
  Leave dang'rous truths to unsuccessful Satires,
  And flattery to fulsome Dedicators,
  Whom, when they praise, the world believes no more,
  Than when they promise to give scribbling o'er.                595
  'T is best sometimes your censure to restrain,
  And charitably let the dull be vain:
  Your silence there is better than your spite,
  For who can rail so long as they can write?
  Still humming on, their drowsy course they keep,               600
  And lash'd so long, like tops, are lash'd asleep.
  False steps but help them to renew the race,
  As, after stumbling, Jades will mend their pace.
  What crowds of these, impenitently bold,
  In sounds and jingling syllables grown old,                    605
  Still run on Poets, in a raging vein,
  Ev'n to the dregs and squeezings of the brain,
  Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense,
  And rhyme with all the rage of Impotence.

This is an atom: 
Such shameless Bards we have; and yet't is true,               610
  There are as mad abandon'd Critics too.
  The bookful blockhead, ignorantly read,
  With loads of learned lumber in his head,
  With his own tongue still edifies his ears,
  And always list'ning to himself appears.                       615
  All books he reads, and all he reads assails.
  From Dryden's Fables down to Durfey's Tales.
  With him, most authors steal their works, or buy;
  Garth did not write his own Dispensary.

This is an atom: 
Name a new Play, and he's the Poet's friend,                   620
  Nay show'd his faults--but when would Poets mend?
  No place so sacred from such fops is barr'd,
  Nor is Paul's church more safe than Paul's churchyard:
  Nay, fly to Altars; there they'll talk you dead:
  For Fools rush in where Angels fear to tread.                  625
  Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks,    }
  It still looks home, and short excursions makes; }
  But rattling nonsense in full volleys breaks,    }
  And never shock'd, and never turn'd aside,
  Bursts out, resistless, with a thund'ring tide.                630

This is an atom: 
But where's the man, who counsel can bestow,
  Still pleas'd to teach, and yet not proud to know?
  Unbiass'd, or by favour, or by spite;
  Not dully prepossess'd, nor blindly right;
  Tho' learn'd, well-bred; and tho' well-bred, sincere,          635
  Modestly bold, and humanly severe:
  Who to a friend his faults can freely show,
  And gladly praise the merit of a foe?
  Blest with a taste exact, yet unconfin'd;
  A knowledge both of books and human kind:                      640
  Gen'rous converse; a soul exempt from pride;
  And love to praise, with reason on his side?

This is an atom: 
Such once were Critics; such the happy few,
  Athens and Rome in better ages knew.
  The mighty Stagirite first left the shore,                     645
  Spread all his sails, and durst the deeps explore:
  He steer'd securely, and discover'd far,
  Led by the light of the MÃ¦onian Star.
  Poets, a race long unconfin'd, and free,
  Still fond and proud of savage liberty,                        650
  Receiv'd his laws; and stood convinc'd 't was fit,
  Who conquer'd Nature, should preside o'er Wit.

This is an atom: 
Horace still charms with graceful negligence,
  And without method talks us into sense,
  Will, like a friend, familiarly convey                         655
  The truest notions in the easiest way.
  He, who supreme in judgment, as in wit,
  Might boldly censure, as he boldly writ,
  Yet judg'd with coolness, tho' he sung with fire;
  His Precepts teach but what his works inspire.                 660
  Our Critics take a contrary extreme,
  They judge with fury, but they write with fle'me:
  Nor suffers Horace more in wrong Translations
  By Wits, than Critics in as wrong Quotations.

This is an atom: 
See Dionysius Homer's thoughts refine,                       665
  And call new beauties forth from ev'ry line!
    Fancy and art in gay Petronius please,
  The scholar's learning, with the courtier's ease.

This is an atom: 
In grave Quintilian's copious work, we find
  The justest rules, and clearest method join'd:                 670
  Thus useful arms in magazines we place,
  All rang'd in order, and dispos'd with grace,
  But less to please the eye, than arm the hand,
  Still fit for use, and ready at command.

This is an atom: 
Thee, bold Longinus! all the Nine inspire,                     675
  And bless their Critic with a Poet's fire.
  An ardent Judge, who zealous in his trust,
  With warmth gives sentence, yet is always just;
  Whose own example strengthens all his laws;
  And is himself that great Sublime he draws.                    680

This is an atom: 
Thus long succeeding Critics justly reign'd,
  Licence repress'd, and useful laws ordain'd.
  Learning and Rome alike in empire grew;
  And Arts still follow'd where her Eagles flew;
  From the same foes, at last, both felt their doom,             685
  And the same age saw Learning fall, and Rome.
  With Tyranny, then Superstition join'd,
  As that the body, this enslav'd the mind;
  Much was believ'd, but little understood,
  And to be dull was constru'd to be good;                       690
  A second deluge Learning thus o'er-run,
  And the Monks finish'd what the Goths begun.

This is an atom: 
At length Erasmus, that great injur'd name,
  (The glory of the Priesthood, and the shame!)
  Stemm'd the wild torrent of a barb'rous age,                   695
  And drove those holy Vandals off the stage.

This is an atom: 
But see! each Muse, in LEO'S golden days,
  Starts from her trance, and trims her wither'd bays,
  Rome's ancient Genius, o'er its ruins spread,
  Shakes off the dust, and rears his rev'rend head.              700
  Then Sculpture and her sister-arts revive;
  Stones leap'd to form, and rocks began to live;
  With sweeter notes each rising Temple rung;
  A Raphael painted, and a Vida sung.
  Immortal Vida: on whose honour'd brow                          705
  The Poet's bays and Critic's ivy grow:
  Cremona now shal ever boast thy name,
  As next in place to Mantua, next in fame!

This is an atom: 
But soon by impious arms from Latium chas'd,
  Their ancient bounds the banish'd Muses pass'd;                710
  Thence Arts o'er all the northern world advance,
  But Critic-learning flourish'd most in France:
  The rules a nation, born to serve, obeys;
  And Boileau still in right of Horace sways.
  But we, brave Britons, foreign laws despis'd,                  715
  And kept unconquer'd, and unciviliz'd;
  Fierce for the liberties of wit, and bold,
  We still defy'd the Romans, as of old.
  Yet some there were, among the sounder few
  Of those who less presum'd, and better knew,                   720
  Who durst assert the juster ancient cause,
  And here restor'd Wit's fundamental laws.
  Such was the Muse, whose rules and practice tell,
  "Nature's chief Master-piece is writing well."

This is an atom: 
Such was Roscommon, not more learn'd than good,                725
  With manners gen'rous as his noble blood;
  To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known,
  And ev'ry author's merit, but his own.
  Such late was Walsh--the Muse's judge and friend,
  Who justly knew to blame or to commend;                        730
  To failings mild, but zealous for desert;
  The clearest head, and the sincerest heart.
  This humble praise, lamented shade! receive,
  This praise at least a grateful Muse may give:
  The Muse, whose early voice you taught to sing,                735
  Prescrib'd her heights, and prun'd her tender wing,
  (Her guide now lost) no more attempts to rise,
  But in low numbers short excursions tries:
  Content, if hence th' unlearn'd their wants may view,
  The learn'd reflect on what before they knew:                  740
  Careless of censure, nor too fond of fame;
  Still pleas'd to praise, yet not afraid to blame,
  Averse alike to flatter, or offend;
  Not free from faults, nor yet too vain to mend.

AN ESSAY ON MAN

This is an atom: 
TO  H. ST. JOHN LORD BOLINGBROKE

This is an atom: 
THE DESIGN

This is an atom: 
Having proposed to write some pieces on Human Life and Manners, such as (to use my Lord Bacon's
expression) _come home to Men's Business and Bosoms_, I thought it more satisfactory to begin
with considering _Man_ in the abstract, his _Nature_ and his _State_; since, to prove any moral
duty, to enforce any moral precept, or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature
whatsoever, it is necessary first to know what _condition_ and _relation_ it is placed in,
and what is the proper end and purpose of its _being_.

This is an atom: 
The science of Human Nature is, like all other sciences, reduced to a _few clear points_: There
are not _many certain truths_ in this world. It is therefore in the Anatomy of the mind as
in that of the Body; more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and
perceptible parts, than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels, the conformations
and uses of which will for ever escape our observation. The _disputes_ are all upon these last,
and, I will venture to say, they have less sharpened the _wits_ than the _hearts_ of men against
each other, and have diminished the practice, more than advanced the theory of Morality. If
I could flatter myself that this Essay has any merit, it is in steering betwixt the extremes
of doctrines seemingly opposite, in passing over terms utterly unintelligible, and in forming
a _temperate_ yet not _inconsistent_, and a _short_ yet not _imperfect_ system of Ethics.

This is an atom: 
This I might have done in prose, but I chose verse, and even rhyme, for two reasons. The one
will appear obvious; that principles, maxims, or precepts so written, both strike the reader
more strongly at first, and are more easily retained by him afterwards: The other may seem
odd, but is true, I found I could express them more _shortly_ this way than in prose itself;
and nothing is more certain, than that much of the _force_ as well as _grace_ of arguments
or instructions, depends on their _conciseness_. I was unable to treat this part of my subject
more in _detail_, without becoming dry and tedious; or more _poetically_, without sacrificing
perspicuity to ornament, without wandring from the precision, or breaking the chain of reasoning:
If any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them, I freely confess he will
compass a thing above my capacity.

This is an atom: 
What is now published, is only to be considered as a _general Map_ of MAN, marking out no more
than the _greater parts_, their _extent_, their _limits_, and their _connection_, and leaving
the particular to be more fully delineated in the charts which are to follow. Consequently,
these Epistles in their progress (if I have health and leisure to make any progress) will be
less dry, and more susceptible of poetical ornament. I am here only opening the _fountains_,
and clearing the passage. To deduce the _rivers_, to follow them in their course, and to observe
their effects, may be a task more agreeable.

This is an atom: 
ARGUMENT OF EPISTLE I

This is an atom: 
Of the Nature and State of Man, with respect to the UNIVERSE.

This is an atom: 
_Of_ Man _in the abstract_.

This is an atom: 
I.   v. 17 &c.    _That we can judge only with regard to our_ own
                  system, _being ignorant of the_ relations _of
                  systems and things_.

This is an atom: 
II.  v. 35, &c.   _That Man is not to be deemed_ imperfect, _but a Being
                  suited to his_ place _and_ rank _in the creation,
                  agreeable to the_ general Order _of things, and
                  conformable to_ Ends _and_ Relations _to him unknown_.

This is an atom: 
III. v. 77, &c.   _That it is partly upon his_ ignorance _of_ future
                  _events, and partly upon the_ hope _of a_ future
                  _state, that all his happiness in the present
                  depends_.

This is an atom: 
IV.  v. 109, &c. _The_ pride _of aiming at more knowledge, and
                 pretending to more Perfections, the cause of Man's
                 error and misery. The_ impiety _of putting himself in
                 the place of_ God, _and judging of the fitness or
                 unfitness, perfection or imperfection, justice or
                 injustice of his dispensations_.

This is an atom: 
V.   v. 131, &c. _The_ absurdity _of conceiting himself the _final cause
                 _of the creation, or expecting that perfection in the_
                 moral _world, which is not in the_ natural.

This is an atom: 
VI.  v. 173, &c. _The_ unreasonableness _of his complaints against_
                 Providence, _while on the one hand he demands the
                 Perfections of the Angels, and on the other the bodily
                 qualifications of the Brutes; though, to possess any of
                 the_ sensitive faculties _in a higher degree, would
                 render him miserable_.

This is an atom: 
VII. v. 207.     _That throughout the whole visible world, an universal_
                 order _and_ gradation _in the sensual and mental
                 faculties is observed, which causes a_ subordination
                 _of creature to creature, and of all creatures to Man.
                 The gradations of_ sense, instinct, thought,
                 reflection, reason; _that Reason alone countervails
                 fill the other faculties_.

This is an atom: 
VIII. v. 233.    _How much further this_ order _and_ subordination _of
                 living creatures may extend, above and below us; were
                 any part of which broken, not that part only, but the
                 whole connected_ creation _must be destroyed_.

This is an atom: 
IX.  v. 250.     _The_ extravagance, madness, _and_ pride _of such a
                 desire_.

This is an atom: 
X.   v. 281, &c. _The consequence of all, the_ absolute submission
_to the end_.    _due to Providence, both as to our_ present _and_
                 future state,

This is an atom: 
EPISTLE I

This is an atom: 
Awake, my ST. JOHN! leave all meaner things
        To low ambition, and the pride of Kings.
        Let us (since Life can little more supply
        Than just to look about us and to die)
        Expatiate free o'er all this scene of Man;                  5
        A mighty maze! but not without a plan;
        A Wild, where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot;
        Or Garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.
        Together let us beat this ample field,
        Try what the open, what the covert yield;                  10
        The latent tracts, the giddy heights, explore
        Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;
        Eye Nature's walks, shoot Folly as it flies,
        And catch the Manners living as they rise;
        Laugh where we must, be candid where we can;               15
        But vindicate the ways of God to Man.

This is an atom: 
I.      Say first, of God above, or Man below,
        What can we reason, but from what we know?
        Of Man, what see we but his station here,
        From which to reason, or to which refer?                   20
        Thro' worlds unnumber'd tho' the God be known,
        'Tis ours to trace him only in our own.
        He, who thro' vast immensity can pierce,
        See worlds on worlds compose one universe,
        Observe how system into system runs,                       25
        What other planets circle other suns,
        What vary'd Being peoples ev'ry star,
        May tell why Heav'n has made us as we are.
        But of this frame the bearings, and the ties,
        The strong connexions, nice dependencies,                  30
        Gradations just, has thy pervading soul
        Look'd thro'? or can a part contain the whole?

This is an atom: 
Is the great chain, that draws all to agree,
        And drawn supports, upheld by God, or thee?

This is an atom: 
II.     Presumptuous Man! the reason wouldst thou find,            35
        Why form'd so weak, so little, and so blind?
        First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess,
        Why form'd no weaker, blinder, and no less?
        Ask of thy mother earth, why oaks are made
        Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade?              40
        Or ask of yonder argent fields above,
        Why JOVE'S satellites are less than JOVE?

This is an atom: 
Of Systems possible, if 'tis confest
        That Wisdom infinite must form the best,
        Where all must full or not coherent be,                    45
        And all that rises, rise in due degree;
        Then, in the scale of reas'ning life, 'tis plain,
        There must be, somewhere, such a rank as Man:
        And all the question (wrangle e'er so long)
        Is only this, if God has plac'd him wrong?                 50

This is an atom: 
Respecting Man, whatever wrong we call,
        May, must be right, as relative to all.
        In human works, tho' labour'd on with pain,
        A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;
        In God's, one single can its end produce;                  55
        Yet serves to second too some other use.
        So Man, who here seems principal alone,
        Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown,
        Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal;
        'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole.                   60

This is an atom: 
When the proud steed shall know why Man restrains
        His fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains:
        When the dull Ox, why now he breaks the clod,
        Is now a victim, and now Ãgypt's God:
        Then shall Man's pride and dulness comprehend              65
        His actions', passions', being's, use and end;
        Why doing, suff'ring, check'd, impell'd; and why
        This hour a slave, the next a deity.

This is an atom: 
Then say not Man's imperfect, Heav'n in fault;
        Say rather, Man's as perfect as he ought:                  70
        His knowledge measur'd to his state and place;
        His time a moment, and a point his space.
        If to be perfect in a certain sphere,
        What matter, soon or late, or here or there?
        The blest to day is as completely so,                      75
        As who began a thousand years ago.

This is an atom: 
III.    Heav'n from all creatures hides the book of Fate,
        All but the page prescrib'd, their present state:
        From brutes what men, from men what spirits know:
        Or who could suffer Being here below?                      80
        The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,
        Had he thy Reason, would he skip and play?
        Pleas'd to the last, he crops the flow'ry food,
        And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood.
        Oh blindness to the future! kindly giv'n,                  85
        That each may fill the circle mark'd by Heav'n:
        Who sees with equal eye, as God of all,
        A hero perish, or a sparrow fall,
        Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd,
        And now a bubble burst, and now a world.                   90

This is an atom: 
Hope humbly then: with trembling pinions soar;
        Wait the great teacher Death; and God adore.
        What future bliss, he gives not thee to know,
        But gives that Hope to be thy blessing now.
        Hope springs eternal in the human breast:                  95
        Man never Is, but always To be blest:
        The soul, uneasy and confin'd from home,
        Rests and expatiates in a life to come.

This is an atom: 
Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind
        Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind:             100
        His soul, proud Science never taught to stray
        Far as the solar walk, or milky way;
        Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n,
        Behind the cloud-topt hill, an humbler heav'n;
        Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,              105
        Some happier island in the watry waste,
        Where slaves once more their native land behold,
        No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.
        To Be, contents his natural desire,
        He asks no Angel's wing, no Seraph's fire;                110
        But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,
        His faithful dog shall bear him company.

This is an atom: 
IV.     Go, wiser thou! and, in thy scale of sense,
        Weight thy Opinion against Providence;
        Call imperfection what thou fancy'st such,                115
        Say, here he gives too little, there too much:
        Destroy all Creatures for thy sport or gust,
        Yet cry, If Man's unhappy, God's unjust;
        If Man alone engross not Heav'n's high care,
        Alone made perfect here, immortal there:                  120
        Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod,
        Re-judge his justice, be the God of God.
        In Pride, in reas'ning Pride, our error lies;
        All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies.

This is an atom: 
Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes,                125
        Men would be Angels, Angels would be Gods.
        Aspiring to be Gods, if Angels fell,
        Aspiring to be Angels, Men rebel:
        And who but wishes to invert the laws
        Of ORDER, sins against th' Eternal Cause.                 130

This is an atom: 
V.      Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine,
        Earth for whose use? Pride answers, "'Tis for mine:
        For me kind Nature wakes her genial Pow'r,
        Suckles each herb, and spreads out ev'ry flow'r;
        Annual for me, the grape, the rose renew                  135
        The juice nectareous, and the balmy dew;
        For me, the mine a thousand treasures brings;
        For me, health gushes from a thousand springs;
        Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise;
        My foot-stool earth, my canopy the skies."                140

But errs not Nature from his gracious end,
        From burning suns when livid deaths descend,
        When earthquakes swallow, or when tempests sweep
        Towns to one grave, whole nations to the deep?
        "No, ('tis reply'd) the first Almighty Cause              145
        Acts not by partial, but by gen'ral laws;
        Th' exceptions few; some change since all began:
        And what created perfect?"--Why then Man?
        If the great end be human Happiness,
        Then Nature deviates; and can Man do less?                150
        As much that end a constant course requires
        Of show'rs and sun-shine, as of Man's desires;
        As much eternal springs and cloudless skies,
        As Men for ever temp'rate, calm, and wise.
        If plagues or earthquakes break not Heav'n's design,      155
        Why then a Borgia, or a Catiline?
        Who knows but he, whose hand the lightning forms,
        Who heaves old Ocean, and who wings the storms;
        Pours fierce Ambition in a CÃ¦sar's mind,
        Or turns young Ammon loose to scourge mankind?            160
        From pride, from pride, our very reas'ning springs;
        Account for moral, as for nat'ral things:
        Why charge we Heav'n in those, in these acquit?
        In both, to reason right is to submit.

This is an atom: 
Better for Us, perhaps, it might appear,                  165
        Were there all harmony, all virtue here;
        That never air or ocean felt the wind;
        That never passion discompos'd the mind.
        But ALL subsists by elemental strife;
        And Passions are the elements of Life.                    170
        The gen'ral ORDER, since the whole began,
        Is kept in Nature, and is kept in Man.

VI.     What would this Man? Now upward will he soar,
        And little less than Angel, would be more;
        Now looking downwards, just as griev'd appears            175
        To want the strength of bulls, the fur of bears.
        Made for his use all creatures if he call,
        Say what their use, had he the pow'rs of all?
        Nature to these, without profusion, kind,
        The proper organs, proper pow'rs assign'd;                180
        Each seeming want compensated of course,
        Here with degrees of swiftness, there of force;
        All in exact proportion to the state;
        Nothing to add, and nothing to abate.
        Each beast, each insect, happy in its own:                185
        Is Heav'n unkind to Man, and Man alone?
        Shall he alone, whom rational we call,
        Be pleas'd with nothing, if not bless'd with all?

This is an atom: 
The bliss of Man (could Pride that blessing find)
        Is not to act or think beyond mankind;                    190
        No pow'rs of body or of soul to share,
        But what his nature and his state can bear.
        Why has not Man a microscopic eye?
        For this plain reason, Man is not a Fly.
        Say what the use, were finer optics giv'n,                195
        T' inspect a mite, not comprehend the heav'n?
        Or touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er,
        To smart and agonize at every pore?
        Or quick effluvia darting thro' the brain,
        Die of a rose in aromatic pain?                           200
        If Nature thunder'd in his op'ning ears,
        And stunn'd him with the music of the spheres,
        How would he wish that Heav'n had left him still
        The whisp'ring Zephyr, and the purling rill?
        Who finds not Providence all good and wise,               205

VII.    Far as Creation's ample range extends,
        The scale of sensual, mental pow'rs ascends:
        Mark how it mounts, to Man's imperial race,
        From the green myriads in the peopled grass:            210
        What modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme,
        The mole's dim curtain, and the lynx's beam:
        Of smell, the headlong lioness between,
        And hound sagacious on the tainted green:
        Of hearing, from the life that fills the Flood,        215
        To that which warbles thro' the vernal wood:
        The spider's touch, how exquisitely fine!
        Feels at each thread, and lives along the line:
        In the nice bee, what sense so subtly true
        From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew?         220
        How Instinct varies in the grov'lling swine,
        Compar'd, half-reas'ning elephant, with thine!
        'Twixt that, and Reason, what a nice barrier,
        For ever sep'rate, yet for ever near!
        Remembrance and Reflection how ally'd;                 225
        What thin partitions Sense from Thought divide:
        And Middle natures, how they long to join,
        Yet never pass th' insuperable line!
        Without this just gradation, could they be
        Subjected, these to those, or all to thee?             230
        The pow'rs of all subdu'd by thee alone,
        Is not thy Reason all these pow'rs in one?

This is an atom: 
VIII.   See, thro' this air, this ocean, and this earth,
        All matter quick, and bursting into birth.
        Above, how high, progressive life may go!              235
        Around, how wide! how deep extend below!
        Vast chain of Being! which from God began,
        Natures ethereal, human, angel, man,
        Beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see,
        No glass can reach; from Infinite to thee,             240
        From thee to Nothing.--On superior pow'rs
        Were we to press, inferior might on ours:
        Or in the full creation leave a void,
        Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroy'd:
        From Nature's chain whatever link you strike,          245
        Tenth or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike.

And, if each system in gradation roll

        Planets and Suns run lawless thro' the sky;
        Let ruling Angels from their spheres be hurl'd,

        Heav'n's whole foundations to their centre nod,        255

        What if the head, the eye, or ear repin'd
        To serve mere engines to the ruling Mind?
        Just as absurd for any part to claim
        To be another, in this gen'ral frame:
        Just as absurd, to mourn the tasks or pains,           265
        The great directing MIND of ALL ordains.

This is an atom: 
All are but parts of one stupendous whole,
        Whose body Nature is, and God the soul;
        That, chang'd thro' all, and yet in all the same;
        Great in the earth, as in th' ethereal frame;          270
        Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,
        Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees,
        Lives thro' all life, extends thro' all extent,
        Spreads undivided, operates unspent;
        Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,         275
        As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart:
        As full, as perfect, in vile Man that mourns,
        As the rapt Seraph that adores and burns:
        To him no high, no low, no great, no small;
        He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.         280

X.      Cease then, nor ORDER Imperfection name:
        Our proper bliss depends on what we blame.
        Know thy own point: This kind, this due degree
        Of blindness, weakness, Heav'n bestows on thee.
        Submit.--In this, or any other sphere,                 285
        Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear:
        Safe in the hand of one disposing Pow'r,
        Or in the natal, or the mortal hour.
        All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee;
        All Chance, Direction, which thou canst not see;       290
        All Discord, Harmony not understood;
        All partial Evil, universal Good:
        And, spite of Pride, in erring Reason's spite,
        One truth is clear, WHATEVER IS, IS RIGHT.

EPISTLE TO DR ARBUTHNOT

This is an atom: 
Advertisement to the first publication of this _Epistle_

This is an atom: 
This paper is a sort of bill of complaint, begun many years since, and drawn up by snatches,
as the several occasions offered. I had no thoughts of publishing it, till it pleased some
Persons of Rank and Fortune (the Authors of _Verses to the Imitator of Horace_, and of an _Epistle
to a Doctor of Divinity from a Nobleman at Hampton Court_) to attack, in a very extraordinary
manner, not only my Writings (of which, being public, the Public is judge), but my P_erson,
Morals_, and _Family_, whereof, to those who know me not, a truer information may be requisite.
Being divided between the necessity to say something of _myself_, and my own laziness to undertake
so awkward a task, I thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this Epistle. If it
have any thing pleasing, it will be that by which I am most desirous to please, the _Truth_
and the _Sentiment_; and if any thing offensive, it will be only to those I am least sorry
to offend, _the vicious_ or _the ungenerous_.

This is an atom: 
Many will know their own pictures in it, there being not a circumstance but what is true; but
I have, for the most part, spared their _Names_, and they may escape being laughed at, if they
please.

This is an atom: 
I would have some of them know, it was owing to the request of the learned and candid Friend
to whom it is inscribed, that I make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine. However,
I shall have this advantage, and honour, on my side, that whereas, by their proceeding, any
abuse may be directed at any man, no injury can possibly be done by mine, since a nameless
character can never be found out, but by its _truth_ and _likeness_.

This is an atom: 
P.

This is an atom: 
P. shut, shut the door, good John! fatigu'd, I said,
  Tie up the knocker, say I'm sick, I'm dead.
  The Dog-star rages! nay't is past a doubt,
  All Bedlam, or Parnassus, is let out:
  Fire in each eye, and papers in each hand,                        5
  They rave, recite, and madden round the land.

This is an atom: 
What walls can guard me, or what shade can hide?
  They pierce my thickets, thro' my Grot they glide;
  By land, by water, they renew the charge;
  They stop the chariot, and they board the barge.                 10
  No place is sacred, not the Church is free;
  Ev'n Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me;
  Then from the Mint walks forth the Man of rhyme,
  Happy to catch me just at Dinner-time.

This is an atom: 
Is there a Parson, much bemus'd in beer,                         15
  A maudlin Poetess, a rhyming Peer,
  A Clerk, foredoom'd his father's soul to cross,
  Who pens a Stanza, when he should _engross_?
  Is there, who, lock'd from ink and paper, scrawls
  With desp'rate charcoal round his darken'd walls?                20
  All fly to TWIT'NAM, and in humble strain
  Apply to me, to keep them mad or vain.
  Arthur, whose giddy son neglects the Laws,
  Imputes to me and my damn'd works the cause:
  Poor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope,                         25
  And curses Wit, and Poetry, and Pope.

Friend to my Life! (which did not you prolong,
  The world had wanted many an idle song)
  What _Drop_ or _Nostrum_ can this plague remove?
  Or which must end me, a Fool's wrath or love?                    30
  A dire dilemma! either way I'm sped,
  If foes, they write, if friends, they read me dead.
  Seiz'd and tied down to judge, how wretched I!
  Who can't be silent, and who will not lie.
  To laugh, were want of goodness and of grace,                    35
  And to be grave, exceeds all Pow'r of face.
  I sit with sad civility, I read
  With honest anguish, and an aching head;
  And drop at last, but in unwilling ears,
  This saving counsel, "Keep your piece nine years."               40

This is an atom: 
"Nine years!" cries he, who high in Drury-lane,
  Lull'd by soft Zephyrs thro' the broken pane,
  Rhymes ere he wakes, and prints before _Term_ ends,
  Oblig'd by hunger, and request of friends:
  "The piece, you think, is incorrect? why, take it,               45
  I'm all submission, what you'd have it, make it."

Bless me! a packet.--"'Tis a stranger sues,                      55
  A Virgin Tragedy, an Orphan Muse."
  If I dislike it, "Furies, death and rage!"
  If I approve, "Commend it to the Stage."
  There (thank my stars) my whole Commission ends,
  The Play'rs and I are, luckily, no friends,                      60
  Fir'd that the house reject him, "'Sdeath I'll print it,
  And shame the fools--Your Int'rest, Sir, with Lintot!"
  'Lintot, dull rogue! will think your price too much:'
  "Not, Sir, if you revise it, and retouch."
  All my demurs but double his Attacks;                            65
  At last he whispers, "Do; and we go snacks."
  Glad of a quarrel, straight I clap the door,

'Tis sung, when Midas' Ears began to spring,

  His very Minister who spy'd them first,
  (Some say his Queen) was forc'd to speak, or burst.
  And is not mine, my friend, a sorer case,
  When ev'ry coxcomb perks them in my face?
  A. Good friend, forbear! you deal in dang'rous things.           75
  I'd never name Queens, Ministers, or Kings;
  Keep close to Ears, and those let asses prick;
  'Tis nothing--P. Nothing? if they bite and kick?
  Out with it, DUNCIAD! let the secret pass,
  That secret to each fool, that he's an Ass:                      80

  Let peals of laughter, Codrus! round thee break,                 85
  Thou unconcern'd canst hear the mighty crack:
  Pit, Box, and gall'ry in convulsions hurl'd,
  Thou stand'st unshook amidst a bursting world.
  Who shames a Scribbler? break one cobweb thro',
  He spins the slight, self-pleasing thread anew:                  90
  Destroy his fib or sophistry, in vain,
  The creature's at his dirty work again,
  Thron'd in the centre of his thin designs,
  Proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines!

  I too could write, and I am twice as tall;

  Of all mad creatures, if the learn'd are right,

  _Ammon's_ great son one shoulder had too high,                  115
  Such _Ovid's_ nose, and "Sir! you have an Eye"--
  Go on, obliging creatures, make me see
  All that disgrac'd my Betters, met in me.
  Say for my comfort, languishing in bed,
  "Just so immortal _Maro_ held his head:"                        120

  Great _Homer_ died three thousand years ago.

  Dipt me in ink, my parents', or my own?
  As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame,                         125
  I lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came.
  I left no calling for this idle trade,
  No duty broke, no father disobey'd.
  The Muse but serv'd to ease some friend, not Wife,
  To help me thro' this long disease, my Life,                    130
  To second, ARBUTHNOT! thy Art and Care,
  And teach the Being you preserv'd, to bear.

But why then publish? _Granville_ the polite,
  And knowing _Walsh_, would tell me I could write;
  Well-natur'd _Garth_ inflam'd with early praise;                135
  And _Congreve_ lov'd, and _Swift_ endur'd my lays;
  The courtly _Talbot, Somers, Sheffield_, read;
  Ev'n mitred _Rochester_ would nod the head,
  And _St. John's_ self (great _Dryden's_ friends before)
  With open arms receiv'd one Poet more.                          140
  Happy my studies, when by these approv'd!
  Happier their author, when by these belov'd!
  From these the world will judge of men and books,
  Not from the _Burnets, Oldmixons_, and _Cookes_.

This is an atom: 
Soft were my numbers; who could take offence,                   145
  While pure Description held the place of Sense?
  Like gentle _Fanny's_ was my flow'ry theme,
  A painted mistress, or a purling stream.
  Yet then did _Gildon_ draw his venal quill;--
  I wish'd the man a dinner, and sat still.                       150
  Yet then did _Dennis_ rave in furious fret;
  I never answer'd,--I was not in debt.
  If want provok'd, or madness made them print,
  I wag'd no war with _Bedlam_ or the _Mint_.

Did some more sober Critic come abroad;                         155
  If wrong, I smil'd; if right, I kiss'd the rod.
  Pains, reading, study, are their just pretence,
  And all they want is spirit, taste, and sense.
  Commas and points they set exactly right,
  And 'twere a sin to rob them of their mite.                     160
  Yet ne'er one sprig of laurel grac'd these ribalds,
  From slashing _Bentley_ down to pidling _Tibalds_:
  Each wight, who reads not, and but scans and spells,

  Ev'n such small Critics some regard may claim,                  165
  Preserv'd in _Milton's_ or in _Shakespeare's_ name.
  Pretty! in amber to observe the forms
  Of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms!

  But wonder how the devil they got there.                        170

Were others angry: I excus'd them too;
  Well might they rage, I gave them but their due.
  A man's true merit 'tis not hard to find;
  But each man's secret standard in his mind,
  That Casting-weight pride adds to emptiness,                    175
  This, who can gratify? for who can _guess?_
  The Bard whom pilfer'd Pastorals renown,
  Who turns a Persian tale for half a Crown,
  Just writes to make his barrenness appear,
  And strains, from hard-bound brains, eight lines a year;        180
  He, who still wanting, tho' he lives on theft,
  Steals much, spends little, yet has nothing left:
  And He, who now to sense, now nonsense leaning,
  Means not, but blunders round about a meaning:
  And He, whose fustian's so sublimely bad,                       185
  It is not Poetry, but prose run mad:
  All these, my modest Satire bade _translate_,
  And own'd that nine such Poets made a _Tate_.

Peace to all such! but were there One whose fires
  True Genius kindles, and fair Fame inspires;
  Blest with each talent and each art to please,
  And born to write, converse, and live with ease:
  Should such a man, too fond to rule alone,                      195
  Bear, like the Turk, no brother near the throne.
  View him with scornful, yet with jealous eyes,
  And hate for arts that caus'd himself to rise;
  Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,
  And without sneering, teach the rest to sneer;                  200
  Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike,
  Just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike;

  On wings of winds came flying all abroad?
  I sought no homage from the Race that write;
  I kept, like Asian Monarchs, from their sight:
  Poems I heeded (now be-rhym'd so long)
  No more than thou, great George! a birth-day song.              220
  I ne'er with wits or witlings pass'd my days,
  To spread about the itch of verse and praise;

  Horace and he went hand in hand in song.

  And a true Pindar stood without a head,)
  Receiv'd of wits an undistinguish'd race,                       235
  Who first his judgment ask'd, and then a place:
  Much they extoll'd his pictures, much his seat,
  And flatter'd ev'ry day, and some days eat:
  Till grown more frugal in his riper days,
  He paid some bards with port, and some with praise;             240
  To some a dry rehearsal saw assign'd,
  And others (harder still) he paid in kind.
  _Dryden_ alone (what wonder?) came not nigh,
  _Dryden_ alone escap'd this judging eye:

THE RAPE OF THE LOCK

This is an atom: 
INTRODUCTION

This is an atom: 
In 1711 Pope, who had just published his 'Essay on Criticism', was looking about for new worlds
to conquer. A fortunate chance threw in his way a subject exactly suited to his tastes and
powers. He seized upon it, dashed off his first sketch in less than a fortnight, and published
it anonymously in a 'Miscellany' issued by Lintot in 1712. But the theme had taken firm root
in his mind. Dissatisfied with his first treatment of it, he determined, against the advice
of the best critic of the day, to recast the work, and lift it from a mere society 'jeu d'esprit'
into an elaborate mock-heroic poem. He did so and won a complete success. Even yet, however,
he was not completely satisfied and from time to time he added a touch to his work until he
finally produced the finished picture which we know as 'The Rape of the Lock'. As it stands,
it is an almost flawless masterpiece, a brilliant picture and light-hearted mockery of the
gay society of Queen Anne's day, on the whole the most satisfactory creation of Pope's genius,
and, perhaps, the best example of the mock-heroic in any literature.

This is an atom: 
The occasion which gave rise to 'The Rape of the Lock' has been so often related that it requires
only a brief restatement. Among the Catholic families of Queen Anne's day, who formed a little
society of their own, Miss Arabella Fermor was a reigning belle. In a youthful frolic which
overstepped the bounds of propriety Lord Petre, a young nobleman of her acquaintance, cut off
a lock of her hair. The lady was offended, the two families took up the quarrel, a lasting
estrangement, possibly even a duel, was threatened. At this juncture a common friend of the
two families, a Mr. Caryll, nephew of a well-known Jacobite exile for whom he is sometimes
mistaken, suggested to Pope "to write a poem to make a jest of it," and so kill the quarrel
with laughter. Pope consented, wrote his first draft of 'The Rape of the Lock', and passed
it about in manuscript. Pope says himself that it had its effect in the two families; certainly
nothing more is heard of the feud. How Miss Fermor received the poem is a little uncertain.
Pope complains in a letter written some months after the poem had appeared in print that "the
celebrated lady is offended." According to Johnson she liked the verses well enough to show
them to her friends, and a niece of hers said years afterward that Mr. Pope's praise had made
her aunt "very troublesome and conceited." It is not improbable that Belinda was both flattered
and offended. Delighted with the praise of her beauty she may none the less have felt called
upon to play the part of the offended lady when the poem got about and the ribald wits of the
day began to read into it double meanings which reflected upon her reputation. To soothe her
ruffled feelings Pope dedicated the second edition of the poem to her in a delightful letter
in which he thanked her for having permitted the publication of the first edition to forestall
an imperfect copy offered to a bookseller, declared that the character of Belinda resembled
her in nothing but in beauty, and affirmed that he could never hope that his poem should pass
through the world half so uncensured as she had done. It would seem that the modern critics
who have undertaken to champion Miss Fermor against what they are pleased to term the revolting
behavior of the poet are fighting a needless battle. A pretty girl who would long since have
been forgotten sat as an unconscious model to a great poet; he made her the central figure
in a brilliant picture and rendered her name immortal. That is the whole story, and when carping
critics begin to search the poem for the improprieties of conduct to which they say Pope alluded,
one has but to answer in Pope's own words.

This is an atom: 
If to her share some female errors fall,
  Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.

This is an atom: 
Pope's statement in the dedication that he had been forced into publishing the first draft
of the poem before his design of enlarging it was half executed is probably to be taken, like
many of his statements, with a sufficient grain of salt. Pope had a curious habit of protesting
that he was forced into publishing his letters, poems, and other trifles, merely to forestall
the appearance of unauthorized editions. It is more likely that it was the undoubted success
of 'The Rape of the Lock' in its first form which gave him the idea of working up the sketch
into a complete mock-heroic poem.

This is an atom: 
Examples of such a poem were familiar enough to Pope. Not to go back to the pseudo-Homeric
mock epic which relates the battle of the frogs and mice, Vida in Italy and Boileau in France,
with both of whom Pope, as the 'Essay on Criticism' shows, was well acquainted, had done work
of this kind. Vida's description of the game of chess in his 'Scacchia Ludus' certainly gave
him the model for the game of ombre in the third canto of 'The Rape of the Lock'; Boileau's
'Lutrin' probably suggested to him the idea of using the mock-heroic for the purposes of satire.

This is an atom: 
Now it was a dogma of the critical creed of the day, which Pope devoutly accepted, that every
epic must have a well-recognized "machinery." Machinery, as he kindly explained to Miss Fermor,
was a "term invented by the critics to signify that part which the deities, angels, or demons
are made to act in a poem," in short for the whole supernatural element. Such machinery was
quite wanting in the first draft of the Rape; it must be supplied if the poem was to be a true
epic, even of the comic kind. And the machinery must be of a nature which would lend itself
to the light satiric tone of the poem. What was it to be? The employment of what we may call
Christian machinery, the angels and devils of Tasso and Milton, was, of course, out of the
question. The employment of the classic machinery was almost as impossible. It would have been
hard for such an admirer of the classics as Pope to have taken the deities of Olympus otherwise
than seriously. And even if he had been able to treat them humorously, the humor would have
been a form of burlesque quite at variance with what he had set out to accomplish. For Pope's
purpose, springing naturally from the occasion which set him to writing the 'Rape', was not
to burlesque what was naturally lofty by exhibiting it in a degraded light, but to show the
true littleness of the trivial by treating it in a grandiose and mock-heroic fashion, to make
the quarrel over the stolen lock ridiculous by raising it to the plane of the epic contest
before the walls of Troy.

This is an atom: 
In his perplexity a happy thought, little less in fact than an inspiration of genius, came
to Pope. He had been reading a book by a clever French abbÃ© treating in a satiric fashion of
the doctrines of the so-called Rosicrucians, in particular of their ideas of elemental spirits
and the influence of these spirits upon human affairs. Here was the machinery he was looking
for made to his hand. There would be no burlesque in introducing the Rosicrucian sylphs and
gnomes into a mock-heroic poem, for few people, certainly not the author of the 'Comte de Gabalis',
took them seriously. Yet the widespread popularity of this book, to say nothing of the existence
of certain Rosicrucian societies, had rendered their names familiar to the society for which
Pope wrote. He had but to weave them into the action of his poem, and the brilliant little
sketch of society was transformed into a true mock-epic.

This is an atom: 
The manner in which this interweaving was accomplished is one of the most satisfactory evidences
of Pope's artistic genius. He was proud of it himself. "The making the machinery, and what
was published before, hit so well together, is," he told Spencer, "I think, one of the greatest
proofs of judgment of anything I ever did." And he might well be proud. Macaulay, in a well-known
passage, has pointed out how seldom in the history of literature such a recasting of a poem
has been successfully accomplished. But Pope's revision of 'The Rape of the Lock' was so successful
that the original form was practically done away with. No one reads it now but professed students
of the literature of Queen Anne's time. And so artfully has the new matter been woven into
the old that if the recasting of 'The Rape of the Lock' were not a commonplace even in school
histories of English literature, not one reader in a hundred would suspect that the original
sketch had been revised and enlarged to more than twice its length. It would be an interesting
task for the student to compare the two forms printed in this edition, to note exactly what
has been added, and the reasons for its addition, and to mark how Pope has smoothed the junctures
and blended the old and the new. Nothing that he could do would admit him more intimately to
the secrets of Pope's mastery of his art.

This is an atom: 
A word must be said in closing as to the merits of 'The Rape of the Lock' and its position
in English literature. In the first place it is an inimitable picture of one phase, at least,
of the life of the time, of the gay, witty, heartless society of Queen Anne's day. Slowly recovering
from the licentious excesses of the Restoration, society at this time was perhaps unmoral rather
than immoral. It was quite without ideals, unless indeed the conventions of "good form" may
be dignified by that name. It lacked the brilliant enthusiasm of Elizabethan times as well
as the religious earnestness of the Puritans and the devotion to patriotic and social ideals
which marked a later age. Nothing, perhaps, is more characteristic of the age than its attitude
toward women. It affected indeed a tone of high-flown adoration which thinly veiled a cynical
contempt. It styled woman a goddess and really regarded her as little better than a doll. The
passion of love had fallen from the high estate it once possessed and become the mere relaxation
of the idle moments of a man of fashion.

This is an atom: 
In the comedies of Congreve, for example, a lover even if honestly in love thinks it as incumbent
upon him to make light of his passion before his friends as to exaggerate it in all the forms
of affected compliment before his mistress.

This is an atom: 
In 'The Rape of the Lock' Pope has caught and fixed forever the atmosphere of this age. It
is not the mere outward form and circumstance, the manners and customs, the patching, powdering,
ogling, gambling, of the day that he has reproduced, though his account of these would alone
suffice to secure the poem immortality as a contribution to the history of society. The essential
spirit of the age breathes from every line. No great English poem is at once so brilliant and
so empty, so artistic, and yet so devoid of the ideals on which all high art rests. It is incorrect,
I think, to consider Pope in 'The Rape of the Lock' as the satirist of his age. He was indeed
clever enough to perceive its follies, and witty enough to make sport of them, but it is much
to be doubted whether he was wise enough at this time to raise his eyes to anything better.
In the social satires of Pope's great admirer, Byron, we are at no loss to perceive the ideal
of personal liberty which the poet opposes to the conventions he tears to shreds. Is it possible
to discover in 'The Rape of the Lock' any substitute for Belinda's fancies and the Baron's
freaks? The speech of Clarissa which Pope inserted as an afterthought to point the moral of
the poem recommends Belinda to trust to merit rather than to charms. But "merit" is explicitly
identified with good humor, a very amiable quality, but hardly of the highest rank among the
moral virtues. And the avowed end and purpose of "merit" is merely to preserve what beauty
gains, the flattering attentions of the other sex,--surely the lowest ideal ever set before
womankind. The truth is, I think, that 'The Rape of the Lock' represents Pope's attitude toward
the social life of his time in the period of his brilliant youth. He was at once dazzled, amused,
and delighted by the gay world in which he found himself. The apples of pleasure had not yet
turned to ashes on his lips, and it is the poet's sympathy with the world he paints which gives
to the poem the air, most characteristic of the age itself, of easy, idle, unthinking gayety.
We would not have it otherwise. There are sermons and satires in abundance in English literature,
but there is only one 'Rape of the Lock'.

This is an atom: 
The form of the poem is in perfect correspondence with its spirit. There is an immense advance
over the 'Essay on Criticism' in ease, polish, and balance of matter and manner. And it is
not merely in matters of detail that the supremacy of the latter poem is apparent. 'The Rape
of the Lock' is remarkable among all Pope's longer poems as the one complete and perfect whole.
It is no mosaic of brilliant epigrams, but an organic creation. It is impossible to detach
any one of its witty paragraphs and read it with the same pleasure it arouses when read in
its proper connection. Thalestris' call to arms and Clarissa's moral reproof are integral parts
of the poem. And as a result, perhaps, of its essential unity 'The Rape of the Lock' bears
witness to the presence of a power in Pope that we should hardly have suspected from his other
works, the power of dramatic characterization. Elsewhere he has shown himself a master of brilliant
portraiture, but Belinda, the Baron, and Thalestris are something more than portraits. They
are living people, acting and speaking with admirable consistency. Even the little sketch of
Sir Plume is instinct with life.

This is an atom: 
Finally 'The Rape of the Lock', in its limitations and defects, no less than in its excellencies,
represents a whole period of English poetry, the period which reaches with but few exceptions
from Dryden to Wordsworth. The creed which dominated poetic composition during this period
is discussed in the introduction to the Essay on Criticism, (see p. 103) and is admirably illustrated
in that poem itself. Its repression of individuality, its insistence upon the necessity of
following in the footsteps of the classic poets, and of checking the outbursts of imagination
by the rules of common sense, simply incapacitated the poets of the period from producing works
of the highest order. And its insistence upon man as he appeared in the conventional, urban
society of the day as the one true theme of poetry, its belief that the end of poetry was to
instruct and improve either by positive teaching or by negative satire, still further limited
its field. One must remember in attempting an estimate of 'The Rape of the Lock' that it was
composed with an undoubting acceptance of this creed and within all these narrowing limitations.
And when this is borne in mind, it is hardly too much to say that the poem attains the highest
point possible. In its treatment of the supernatural it is as original as a poem could be at
that day. The brilliancy of its picture of contemporary society could not be heightened by
a single stroke. Its satire is swift and keen, but never ill natured. And the personality of
Pope himself shines through every line. Johnson advised authors who wished to attain a perfect
style to give their days and nights to a study of Addison. With equal justice one might advise
students who wish to catch the spirit of our so-called Augustan age, and to realize at once
the limitations and possibilities of its poetry, to devote themselves to the study of 'The
Rape of the Lock'.

DEDICATION

This is an atom: 
'Mrs. Arabella':

This is an atom: 
the title of Mrs. was still given in Pope's time to unmarried ladies as soon as they were old
enough to enter society.

This is an atom: 
'the Rosicrucian doctrine':

This is an atom: 
the first mention of the Rosicrucians is in a book published in Germany in 1614, inviting all
scholars to join the ranks of a secret society said to have been founded two centuries before
by a certain Christian Rosenkreuz who had mastered the hidden wisdom of the East. It seems
probable that this book was an elaborate hoax, but it was taken seriously at the time, and
the seventeenth century saw the formation of numerous groups of "Brothers of the Rosy Cross."
They dabbled in alchemy, spiritualism, and magic, and mingled modern science with superstitions
handed down from ancient times. Pope probably knew nothing more of them than what he had read
in 'Le Comte de Gabalis'.

This is an atom: 
This was the work of a French abbÃ©, de Montfaucon Villars (1635-1673), who was well known in
his day both as a preacher and a man of letters. It is really a satire upon the fashionable
mystical studies, but treats in a tone of pretended seriousness of secret sciences, of elemental
spirits, and of their intercourse with men. It was translated into English in 1680 and again
in 1714.

which he had captured in Vigo Bay.

This is an atom: 
In the 'Spectator' for August 8, 1711, a mock advertisement is inserted professing to teach

'26 two ... Knights':

This is an atom: 
one of these was the baron, see l. 66.

This is an atom: 
'27 Ombre':

This is an atom: 
a game of cards invented in Spain. It takes its name from the Spanish phrase originally used
by the player who declared trumps: "Yo soy l'hombre," 'i.e.' I am the man. It could be played
by three, five, or nine players, but the usual number was three as here. Each of these received
nine cards, and one of them named the trump and thus became the "ombre," who played against
the two others. If either of the ombre's opponents took more tricks than the ombre, it was
"codille" (l. 92). This meant that the opponent took the stake and the ombre had to replace
it for the next hand.

This is an atom: 
A peculiar feature of ombre is the rank, or value, of the cards. The three best cards were
called "matadores," a Spanish word meaning "killers." The first of these matadores was "Spadillio,"
the ace of spades; the third was "Basto," the ace of clubs. The second, "Manillio," varied
according to the suit. If a black suit were declared, Maniilio was the two of trumps; if a
red suit, Manillio was the seven of trumps. It is worth noting also that the red aces were
inferior to the face cards of their suits except when a red suit was trump.

This is an atom: 
A brief analysis of the game played on this occasion will clear up the passage and leave the
reader free to admire the ingenuity with which Pope has described the contest in terms of epic
poetry.

This is an atom: 
Belinda declares spades trumps and so becomes the "ombre." She leads one after the other the
three matadores; and takes three tricks. She then leads the next highest card, the king of
spades, and wins a fourth trick. Being out of trumps she now leads the king of clubs; but the
baron, who has actually held more spades than Belinda, trumps it with the queen of spades.
All the trumps are now exhausted and the baron's long suit of diamonds is established. He takes
the sixth, seventh, and eighth tricks with the king, queen, and knave of diamonds, respectively.
Everything now depends on the last trick, since Belinda and the baron each have taken four.
The baron leads the ace of hearts and Belinda takes it with the king, thus escaping "codille"
and winning the stake.

Pope's old enemy, Dennis, objected to the impropriety of Belinda's filling the sky with exulting
shouts, and some modern critics have been foolish enough to echo his objection. The whole scene

exclamations of pleasure at winning are in the same fashion magnified into the cheers of a
victorious army.

it would seem from this phrase that coffee was at that time roasted as well as ground in the

as roasting coffee "with his own hands in an engine made for that purpose."

This is an atom: 
Coffee had been introduced into England about the middle of the seventeenth century. In 1657

selling a sort of liquor called coffee, as a great nuisance and prejudice of the neighborhood."

she pretended to be ill in order to show her new possession to sympathetic friends who called
on her.

'40 phantoms':

This is an atom: 
these are the visions, dreadful or delightful, of the disordered imagination produced by spleen.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
like the serpent which Milton describes in 'Paradise Lost', IX, 501-502, "erect amidst his
circling spires."

This is an atom: 
'46 angels in machines':

This is an atom: 
angels coming to help their votaries. The word "machine" here has an old-fashioned technical
sense. It was first used to describe the apparatus by which a god was let down upon the stage
of the Greek theater. Since a god was only introduced at a critical moment to help the distressed
hero, the phrase, "deus ex machina," came to mean a god who rendered aid. Pope transfers it
here to angels.

This is an atom: 
'47 throngs':

This is an atom: 
Pope now describes the mad fancies of people so affected by spleen as to imagine themselves
transformed to inanimate objects.

This is an atom: 
'51 pipkin':

This is an atom: 
a little jar. Homer ('Iliad', XVIII, 373-377) tells how Vulcan had made twenty wonderful tripods
on living wheels that moved from place to place of their own accord.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
Pope in a note to this poem says that a lady of his time actually imagined herself to be a

'Spleenwort':

This is an atom: 
a sort of fern which was once supposed to be a remedy against the spleen.

This is an atom: 
'58 the sex':

This is an atom: 
women.

This is an atom: 
'59 vapours':

This is an atom: 
a form of spleen to which women were supposed to be peculiarly liable, something like our modern
hysteria. It seems to have taken its name from the fogs of England which were thought to cause it.

This is an atom: 
'65 a nymph':

This is an atom: 
Belinda, who had always been so light-hearted that she had never been a victim of the spleen.

This is an atom: 
'89 Citron-waters':

This is an atom: 
a liqueur made by distilling brandy with the rind of citrons. It was a fashionable drink for
ladies at this time.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
Made men suspicious of their wives.

This is an atom: 
'82 Ulysses':

This is an atom: 
Homer ('Odyssey', X, 1-25) tells how Ãolus, the god of the winds, gave Ulysses a wallet of
oxhide in which all the winds that might oppose his journey homeward were closely bound up.

This is an atom: 
'89 Thalestris':

This is an atom: 
the name of a warlike queen of the Amazons. Pope uses it here for a friend of Belinda's, who
excites her to revenge herself for the rape of her lock. It is said that this friend was a
certain Mrs. Morley.

This is an atom: 
'102 loads of lead':

This is an atom: 
curl papers used to be fastened with strips of lead.

This is an atom: 
'105 Honour':

This is an atom: 
female reputation.

This is an atom: 
'109 toast':

This is an atom: 
a slang term in Pope's day for a reigning beauty whose health was regularly drunk by her admirers.
Steele ('Tatler', No. 24) says that the term had its rise from an accident that happened at
Bath in the reign of Charles II. A famous beauty was bathing there in public, and one of her
admirers filled a glass with the water in which she stood and drank her health.

This is an atom: 
"There was in the place," says Steele "a gay fellow, half-fuddled, who
  offered to jump in, and swore though he liked not the liquor, he would
  have the Toast. He was opposed in his resolution; yet this whim gave
  foundation to the present honor which is done to the lady we mention
  in our liquors, who has ever since been called a TOAST."

This is an atom: 
To understand the point of the story one must know that it was an old custom to put a bit of
toast in hot drinks.

This is an atom: 
In this line in the poem Thalestris insinuates that if Belinda submits tamely to the rape of
the lock, her position as a toast will be forfeited.

This is an atom: 
'113-116'

This is an atom: 
Thalestris supposes that the baron will have the lock set in a ring under a bit of crystal.
Old-fashioned hair-rings of this kind are still to be seen.

This is an atom: 
'117 Hyde-park Circus':

This is an atom: 
the Ring of Canto I, l. 44. Grass was not likely to grow there so long as it remained the fashionable
place to drive.

This is an atom: 
'118 in the sound of Bow':

This is an atom: 
within hearing of the bells of the church of St. Mary le Bow in Cheapside. So far back as Ben
Jonson's time (Eastward Ho, I, ii, 36) it was the mark of the unfashionable middle-class citizen
to live in this quarter. A "wit" in Queen Anne's day would have scorned to lodge there.

This is an atom: 
'121 Sir Plume':

This is an atom: 
this was Sir George Brown, brother of Mrs. Morley (Thalestris). He was not unnaturally offended
at the picture drawn of him in this poem. Pope told a friend many years later that

This is an atom: 
"nobody was angry but Sir George Brown, and he was a good deal so, and
  for a long time. He could not bear that Sir Plume should talk nothing
  but nonsense."

This is an atom: 
'124 a clouded cane':

This is an atom: 
a cane of polished wood with cloudlike markings. In the 'Tatler', Mr. Bickerstaff sits in judgment
on canes, and takes away a cane, "curiously clouded, with a transparent amber head, and a blue
ribband to hang upon his wrist," from a young gentleman as a piece of idle foppery. There are
some amusing remarks on the "conduct" of canes in the same essay.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
the box which held the little bits of black sticking-plaster with which ladies used to adorn
their faces. According to Addison ('Spectator', No. 81), ladies even went so far in this fad
as to patch on one side of the face or the other, according to their politics.

This is an atom: 
'7-36'

This is an atom: 
Pope inserted these lines in a late revision in 1717, in order, as he said, to open more clearly
the moral of the poem. The speech of Clarissa is a parody of a famous speech by Sarpedon in
the 'Iliad', XII, 310-328.

showed that they were lighter, less important, than the lady's hair, and so were destined to
lose the battle.

This is an atom: 
the lunar sphere: it was an old superstition that everything lost on earth went to the moon.
An Italian poet, Ariosto, uses this notion in a poem with which Pope was familiar ('Orlando

This is an atom: 
an almanac maker of Pope's day who was given to prophesying future events. Shortly before this
poem was written Swift had issued a mock almanac foretelling that Partridge would die on a
certain day. When that day came Swift got out a pamphlet giving a full account of Partridge's
death. In spite of the poor man's protests, Swift and his friends kept on insisting that he
was dead. He was still living, however, when Pope wrote this poem. Why does Pope call him "th'

AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM

This is an atom: 
INTRODUCTION

This is an atom: 
The 'Essay on Criticism' was the first really important work that Pope gave to the world. He
had been composing verses from early boyhood, and had actually published a set of 'Pastorals'
which had attracted some attention. He was already known to the literary set of London coffeehouses
as a young man of keen wit and high promise, but to the reading public at large he was as yet
an unknown quantity. With the appearance of the 'Essay', Pope not only sprang at once into
the full light of publicity, but seized almost undisputed that position as the first of living
English poets which he was to retain unchallenged till his death. Even after his death down
to the Romantic revival, in fact, Pope's supremacy was an article of critical faith, and this
supremacy was in no small measure founded upon the acknowledged merits of the 'Essay on Criticism.'
Johnson, the last great representative of Pope's own school of thought in matters literary,
held that the poet had never excelled this early work and gave it as his deliberate opinion
that if Pope had written nothing else, the 'Essay' would have placed him among the first poets
and the first critics. The 'Essay on Criticism' is hardly an epoch-making poem, but it certainly
"made" Alexander Pope.

This is an atom: 
The poem was published anonymously in the spring of 1711, when Pope was twenty-three years
old. There has been considerable dispute as to the date of its composition; but the facts seem
to be that it was begun in 1707 and finished in 1709 when Pope had it printed, not for publication,
but for purposes of further correction. As it stands, therefore, it represents a work planned
at the close of Pope's precocious youth, and executed and polished in the first flush of his
manhood. And it is quite fair to say that considering the age of its author the 'Essay on Criticism'
is one of the most remarkable works in English.

This is an atom: 
Not that there is anything particularly original about the 'Essay.' On the contrary, it is
one of the most conventional of all Pope's works. It has nothing of the lively fancy of 'The
Rape of the Lock', little or nothing of the personal note which stamps the later satires and
epistles as so peculiarly Pope's own. Now, the roadway may be so prescribed as to prevent
right angles from being made on the basement, but the complementary angles are ingeniously
made out by allowing the joists to be of extra length, and cutting the ends off when they
come to the square. The effect is extremely picturesque, and I cannot remember seeing this
peculiar piece of construction elsewhere."
At the western end of High street stands Leicester's Hospital, which was originally a hall belonging
to two guilds, but, coming into possession of the Dudleys, was converted into a hospital by
Elizabeth's favorite in 1571. The "master" was to belong to the Established Church, and the
"brethren" were to be retainers of the earl of Leicester and his heirs, preference being given
to those who had served and been disabled in the wars. The act of incorporation gives a list
of neighboring towns and villages, and specifies that queen's soldiers from these, in rotation,
are to have the next presentations. There is a common kitchen, with a cook and porter, and
each brother receives some eighty pounds per annum, besides the privileges of the house.
Early in this century the number of inmates was increased to twenty-two, unlike many such
institutions, whose funded property accumulated without the original
number of patients or the amount of their pensions being correspondingly
increased.

This is an atom: 
The hospital-men still wear the old uniform--a gown of blue cloth, with the silver badge of the
Dudleys, the bear and ragged staff. The chapel has been restored in nearly the old form,
and stretches over the pathway, with a promenade at the top of the flight of steps round it,
and the black-and-white (or half-timbered) building that forms the hospital encloses a spacious
open quadrangle in the style common to hostelries.
The carvings are very fine and varied, and add greatly to the beauty of the galleries and
covered stair. The monastic charities founded by men of the old religion are now in the hands
of the corporation for distribution among the poor of the town, and besides the old grammar-school
founded by Henry VIII., with a yearly exhibition to each of the universities, and open to all boys,
rich and poor, of the town, there are five other public schools and forty almshouses.
The old generous, helpful spirit survives, in spite of new economic theories, in these English
country towns, and landlords and merchants have not yet given up
the old-fashioned belief that where they make their money they are
bound to spend it to the best advantage of their poorer and less
fortunate neighbors.

This is an atom: 
Many local magnates, however, have departed from this rule. Country gentlemen no longer have houses
in the county-town, but flock to London for the purposes of social and fashionable life.
They have decidedly lost in dignity by this rush to the capital, and it is doubtful how far
they have gained in pleasure, though the few whose means still compel them to stay at home,
or only go to town once or twice in a lifetime for a court presentation, would gladly take
the risk for the sake of the experiment. The feeling which made the Rohans adopt as a motto,
"Roy ne puis--Prince ne veux--Rohan je suis," is one which is theoretically strong among the
country squires of England, the possessors of the bluest blood and longest deeds of hereditary
lands; but the snobbishness of the nineteenth century is practically apt to taint the younger
branches when they read of garden-parties given by the royal princes or balls where duchesses
and cabinet ministers are as plentiful as blackberries. Their great-grandmothers, it is true,
were sometimes troubled with the same longings, for among the many
proclamations against the residence in London of country gentlemen
in unofficial positions is one of James I., noticing "those swarms
of gentry, who, through the instigation of their wives, do neglect
their country hospitality and cumber the city, a general nuisance
to the kingdom;" and the royal Solomon elsewhere observes that
"gentlemen resident on their estates are like ships in port--their
value and magnitude are felt and acknowledged; but when at a distance,
as their size seemeth insignificant, so their worth and importance
are not duly estimated."

This is an atom: 
There is a weak point in this simile, however; so, to cover it with a better and more unpretentious
argument, I will quote a few lines from an old poem of Sir Richard Fanshawe on the subject of
one of these proclamations:

This is an atom: 
Nor let the gentry grudge to go Into those places whence they grew,
But think them blest they may do so.

This is an atom:

The solemn county balls, to which access was as difficult as it is
now to a court festivity, have dwindled to public affairs with paid
subscriptions, yet even in their changed conditions they are somewhat
of an event in the winter life of a neighborhood.

This is an atom: 
Everybody has the entrÃ©e who can command the price of a ticket,
though, as a rule, different classes form coteries and dance among
themselves.

This is an atom: 
The country-houses for ten or twelve miles around contribute their Christmas and New Year guests,
often a large party in two or three carriages. Political popularity is not lost sight of, and
civilities to the wives and daughters of the tradesmen and voters often secure more support
in the next election than strict principle warrants; but though the men thus mingle with the
majority of the dancers, it is seldom the ladies leave the upper end of the hall, where the
local aristocracy holds a sort of court. In places where there is a garrison the military are a
great reinforcement to the body of dancers and flirts. The society proper of a county-town
is mostly cut up into a small clique of clerical and professional men, with a few spinsters of
gentle eccentricity and limited means, the sisters and aunts of country gentlemen, and a larger
body of well-to-do tradesmen and their families, including the ministers of the dissenting chapels
and their families. One of the latter may be possibly a preacher of local renown, and one
of the Anglican clergy will almost invariably be an antiquary of real merit. The mayor and
corporation belong, as a rule, to the larger set, but the lawyers and doctors hold a neutral
position and are welcomed everywhere, partly for the sake of gossip, partly for their own individual
merits. Warwick has the additional advantage over many kindred places of the near neighborhood
of Leamington, a fashionable watering-place two miles and a half distant, one of the mushrooms
of this century, but in a practical point of view one of the
brightest and most attractive places in England.

This is an atom: 
At present it far surpasses Warwick in business and bustle, and possesses all the adjuncts of a
health-resort, frequented all the year round, and inhabited by hundreds of resident invalids
for the sake of the excellent medical staff collected there. One of its famous physicians was
often sent for, instead of a London doctor, to the great houses
within a radius of forty or fifty miles.

This is an atom: 
The assembly-rooms, hotels, baths, gardens, bridges and shops of Leamington vie with those of the
continental spas, and the display of dress and the etiquette of society are in wonderful
contrast to the state of the quiet village fifty years ago. But it is pleasant to know that the
new town has already an endowed hospital, founded by Dr. Warneford and called by his name, where
the poor have gratuitous baths and the best medical advice. Not content with being a centre
in its own way, Leamington has improved its prospects by setting up as a rival to Melton
Mowbray in Leicestershire, known as the "hunting metropolis." Three packs of hounds are hunted
regularly during the season within easy distance of the town, which has also annual steeplechases
and a hunting club; and this sporting element serves to redeem Leamington from the character
of masked melancholy which often strikes a tourist in visiting a regular health-resort.

This is an atom: 
In natural beauty Warwickshire is surpassed by other counties, but few can boast of architectural
features equally striking--such magnificent historical memorials as Kenilworth and Warwick
castles, and the humbler beauties to be found in the houses of
Stratford-on-Avon, Polesworth and Meriden.

This is an atom: 
The last is remarkable--as are, indeed, all the villages of
Warwickshire--for its picturesque beauty, and above all for the

Close to the village, on a hill commanding a view of it, stands
Pooley Hall, whose owner in old days obtained a license from Pope
Urban VI. to build a chapel on his own land, "by Reason of the

to the Mother-Church."

This is an atom: 
In the garden of this hall, a modest country-house, a type of the
ordinary run of English homes, stands a chapel--not the original
one, but built on its site--and from it one has a view of the level
ground, the village and the river, evidently still liable to floods.

This is an atom: 
The part of the county that joins Gloucestershire is rich in
apple-orchards, which I remember one year in the blossoming-time,
while the early grass, already green and wavy, fringed the foot of
the trees, and by the road as we passed we looked through hedges
and over low walls into gardens full of crocuses, snowdrops,
narcissuses, early pansies and daffodils, for spring gardens have
become rather a mania in England within ten or twelve years.

This is an atom: 
Here and there older fragments of wall lined the road, and over one

At the rectory of the village in question was a very clever man, an unusual specimen of a

famous on the stage, and he himself struck one as having certainly missed his calling, though
in his appearance and manner he was as free as possible from that
discontented uneasiness with which an underbred person alone carries
a burden.

This is an atom: 
His duties were punctually fulfilled and his parish-work always in
order, yet he went out a good deal and stayed at large houses, where
he was much in request for his marvellous powers of telling stories.

This is an atom: 
This he did systematically, having a notebook to help his memory
as to what anecdotes he had told and to whom, so that he never
repeated himself to the same audience.

This is an atom: 
Besides stories which he told dramatically, and with a professional
air that made it evident that to seem inattentive would be an
offence, he had theories which he would bring out in a startling
way, supporting them by quotations apparently very learned, and
practically, for the sort of audience he had, irrefutable: one was
on the subject of the ark, which he averred to be still buried in
the eternal snows of Mount Ararat, and discoverable by any one with
will and money to bring it to light.

This is an atom: 
As to the question of which of the disputed peaks was the Ararat

[Illustration: COVENTRY GATEWAY.]
One of Warwickshire's oldest towns and best-preserved specimens of
mediÃ¦val architecture is Coventry, famous for its legend of Lady
Godiva, still commemorated by an annual procession during the great
Show Fair, held the first Friday after Trinity Sunday and continued
for eight days.

This is an atom: 
From Warwick to Coventry is a drive of ten miles, past many villages
whose windows and chimneys form as many temptations to stop and
linger, but Coventry itself is so rich in these peculiarities that
a walk through its streets is a reward for one's hurry on the road.

This is an atom: 
One would suppose, according to the saying of a ready-witted lady, that the town must be by
this time full of a large and interesting society, since so many
people have been at various times "sent to Coventry."

This is an atom: 
The origin of the saying, as an equivalent for being tabooed (itself
a term of savage origin and later date), is reported to be the
deserved unpopularity of the military there about a century ago,
when no respectable woman dared to be seen in the streets with a
soldier.

This is an atom: 
This led to the place being considered by regiments as an undesirable post, since they were
shunned by the decent part of the town's-people, and to be "sent
to Coventry" became, in consequence, a synonym for being "cut."

This is an atom: 
There are, however, other interpretations of the saying, and, though
this sounds plausible, it may be incorrect.

This is an atom: 
The heart of the town, once the strong-hold of the "Red Rose," is still very ancient, picturesque
and sombre-looking, though the suburbs have been widened, "improved" and modernized to suit
present requirements. The Coventry of our day depends for its prosperity on its silk and
ribbon trade, necessitating all the appliances of looms, furnaces and dye-houses, which give
employment to a population reaching nearly forty thousand. The continuance of prosperous
trade in most of the ancient English boroughs is a very interesting feature in their history;
and though no doubt the picturesqueness of towns is increased or

Few English towns that have been of any importance centuries ago
have gone back, though some have stood still; and if they have lost
their social prestige, the spirit of the times has gradually made
the loss of less consequence in proportion as the importance of
trade and manufactures has increased.

This is an atom: 
The ribbon trade is indeed a new one, hardly two centuries old, but
Coventry was the centre of the old national woollen industry long
before.

This is an atom: 
Twenty years ago, the silk trade having languished, the queen revived
the fashion of broad ribbons, and Coventry wares became for a while
the rage, just as Honiton lace and Norwich silk shawls did at other
times, chiefly through the same example of court patronage of native
industries.

This is an atom: 
St.

This is an atom: 
Michael's, Trinity and Christ churches furnish the three noted
spires, the first one of the highest and most beautiful in England,
and the third the remains of a Gray Friars' convent, to which a new
church has been attached.

This is an atom: 
Of the ancient cathedral (Lichfield and Coventry conjointly formed
one see) only a few ruins remain, and the same is the case with the
old walls with their thirty-two towers and twelve gates.

This is an atom: 
The old hospitals and schools have fared better--witness Bond's
Hospital at Bablake (once an adjacent hamlet, but now within the
city limits), commonly called Bablake Hospital, founded by the mayor
of Coventry in the latter part of Henry VII.'

This is an atom: 
s reign for the use of forty-five old men, with a revenue of ten hundred and fifty pounds; Ford's
Hospital for thirty-five old women, a building so beautiful in its details that John Carter
the archÃ¦ologist declared that it "ought to be kept in a case;"
Hales' free school, where Dugdale, the famous antiquary and the
possessor of Merivale Hall, near Warwick, received the early part
of his education; and St.

This is an atom: 
Mary's Hall, built by Henry VI. for the Trinity guild on the site
of an old hall now used as a public hall and for town-council
meetings.

This is an atom: 
The buildings surround a courtyard, and are entered by an arched
gateway from the street; and, says Rimmer, it is hardly possible
in all the city architecture of England to find a more interesting
and fine apartment than the great hall.

This is an atom: 
The private buildings in the old part of the town are as noticeable
in their way as the public buildings; and as many owe their origin
to the tradesmen of Coventry, formerly a body well known for its
wealth and importance, they form good indications of the taste of
the ancient "city fathers."

This is an atom: 
In 1448 this body equipped six hundred men, fully armed, for the
royal service, and in 1459 they were proud to receive the _Parliamentum
Diabolicum_ which Henry VI. called together within shelter of their
walls, and turned to the use of a public prosecution against the
beaten party of the White Rose: hence its name.

This is an atom: 
One of the private houses, at the corner of Hertford street, bears
on its upper part an effigy of the tailor, Peeping Tom, who, tradition
says, was struck dead for impertinently gazing at Countess Godiva
on her memorable ride through the town.

The great variety in the designs of windows and chimneys, and the
disregard of regularity or conventionality in their placing, are
characteristics which distinguish old English domestic architecture,
as also the lavish use of wood-carving on the outside as well as
the inside of dwellings.

This is an atom: 
No Swiss chalet can match the vagaries in wood common to the gable
balconies of old houses, whether private or public: one beautiful
instance occurs, for example, in a butcher's stall and dwelling,
the only one left of a similar row in Hereford.

This is an atom: 
Here, besides the ordinary devices, all the emblems of a
slaughter-house--axes, rings, ropes, etc., and bulls' heads and
horns--are elaborately reproduced over the doors and balconies of
the building, and the windows, each a projecting one, are curiously
wreathed and entwined.

This is an atom: 
This ingeniousness in carving is a thing unknown now, when even
picture-frames are cast in moulds and present a uniform and meaningless
appearance, while as to house decoration the eye wearies of the few
paltry, often-repeated knobs or triangles which have taken the place
of the old individual carvings.

This is an atom: 
Even villages of a few hundred inhabitants often possessed market-places
architecturally worthy of attention, and sometimes the covered
market, open on all sides and formed of pillars and pointed arches,
supported a town-hall or rooms for public purposes above.

This is an atom: 
The crosses were by no means simply religious emblems: though their
presence aimed at reminding worldlings of religion and investing
common acts of life with a religious significance, their purposes
were mainly practical.

This is an atom: 
Proclamations were read from the steps and tolls collected from the
market-people: again, they served for open-air pulpits, and often
as distributing-places for some "dole" or charity bequeathed to the
poor of the town.

This is an atom: 
A fountain was sometimes attached to them, and the covered
market-crosses, of which a few remain (Beverly, Malmesbury and
Salisbury), were merely covered spaces, surmounted with a cross,
for country people to rest in in the heat or the rain, and were
generally the property of some religious house in the neighborhood.

This is an atom: 
They were usually octagonal and richly groined, and if small when
considered as a shelter, were yet generally sufficient for their
purpose, as most of the market-squares were full of covered stalls,
with tents, awnings or umbrellas, as they are to this day.

This is an atom: 
The crosses were sometimes only an eight-sided shaft ornamented with niches and surmounted
by a crucifix, and very often, of whatever shape they were, they
were built _in memoriam_ to a dead relative by some rich merchant
or landlord.

This is an atom: 
As objects of beauty they were unrivalled, and improved the look
of a village-green as much as that of a busy market.

But Coventry, as I have said before, is a growing as well as an
ancient city; and when places grow they must rival their neighbors
in pleasure as well as in business, which accounts for the yearly
races, now established nearly forty years, and each year growing
more popular and successful.

This is an atom: 
No doubt the share of gentlemen's houses which falls to the lot of every county-town in England
has something to do with the brilliancy of these local gatherings:
every one in the neighborhood makes it a point to patronize the
local gayeties, to belong to the local military, to enter horses,
to give prizes, to attend balls; and if politics are never quite
forgotten, especially since the suffrage has been extended and the
number of voters to be conciliated so suddenly increased, this only
adds to the outer bustle and success of these social "field-days."

This is an atom: 
Coventry has a pretty flourishing watchmaking trade, besides its
staple one of ribbon-weaving; and indeed the whole county, villages
included, is given up to manufacture: the places round Warwick and
Coventry to a great extent share in the silk trade, while Alcester
has a needle manufacture of its own, Atherstone a hat manufacture,
and Amworth, which is partly in Staffordshire, was famous until
lately for calico-printing and making superfine narrow woollen
cloths: it also has flax-mills.

This is an atom: 
The kings of Mercia used to keep state here, and the Roman road,
Watling Street, passed through it, with which contrast now the iron
roads that pass every place of the least importance, and in this

wide-awake, turbulent, educated, hard-headed Birmingham.

This, too, is within the "King-maker's" county, and how oddly it

with the political and parliamentary history of England within the
last forty years; but, though now an ultra-Radical constituency,
it is no historical upstart, but can trace its name in Domesday
Book, where it appears as _Bermengeham_, and can find its record
as an English Damascus in the fifteenth century, before which it
had been already famous for leather-tanning.

This is an atom: 
mediaeval scholars, followers respectively of Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas. A long dispute
raged between their disciples. In this couplet Pope points out that the dispute is now forgotten,
and the books of the old disputants lie covered with cobwebs in Duck-lane, a street in London
where second-hand books were sold in Pope's day. He calls the cobwebs "kindred," because the
arguments of Thomists and Scotists were as fine spun as a spider's web.

AN ESSAY ON MAN

This is an atom: 
INTRODUCTION

This is an atom: 
The 'Essay on Man' is the longest and in some ways the most important work of the third period
of Pope's career. It corresponds closely to his early work, the 'Essay on Criticism'. Like
the earlier work, the 'Essay on Man' is a didactic poem, written primarily to diffuse and popularize
certain ideas of the poet. As in the earlier work these ideas are by no means original with
Pope, but were the common property of a school of thinkers in his day. As in the 'Essay on
Criticism', Pope here attempts to show that these ideas have their origin in nature and are
consistent with the common sense of man. And finally the merit of the later work, even more
than of the earlier, is due to the force and brilliancy of detached passages rather than to
any coherent, consistent, and well-balanced system which it presents.

This is an atom: 
The close of the seventeenth century and beginning of the eighteenth was marked by a change
of ground in the sphere of religious controversy. The old debates between the Catholic and
Protestant churches gradually died out as these two branches of Western Christianity settled
down in quiet possession of the territory they still occupy. In their place arose a vigorous
controversy on the first principles of religion in general, on the nature of God, the origin
of evil, the place of man in the universe, and the respective merits of optimism and pessimism
as philosophic theories. The controversialists as a rule either rejected or neglected the dogmas
of revealed religion and based their arguments upon real or supposed facts of history, physical
nature, and the mental processes and moral characteristics of man. In this controversy the
two parties at times were curiously mingled. Orthodox clergymen used arguments which justified
a strong suspicion of their orthodoxy; and avowed freethinkers bitterly disclaimed the imputation
of atheism and wrote in terms that might be easily adopted by a devout believer.

This is an atom: 
Into this controversy Pope was led by his deepening intimacy with Bolingbroke, who had returned
from France in 1725 and settled at his country place within a few miles of Twickenham. During
his long exile Bolingbroke had amused himself with the study of moral philosophy and natural
religion, and in his frequent intercourse with Pope he poured out his new-found opinions with
all the fluency, vigor, and polish which made him so famous among the orators and talkers of
the day. Bolingbroke's views were for that time distinctly heterodox, and, if logically developed,
led to complete agnosticism. But he seems to have avoided a complete statement of his ideas
to Pope, possibly for fear of shocking or frightening the sensitive little poet who still remained
a professed Catholic. Pope, however, was very far from being a strict Catholic, and indeed
prided himself on the breadth and liberality of his opinions. He was, therefore, at once fascinated
and stimulated by the eloquent conversation of Bolingbroke, and resolved to write a philosophical
poem in which to embody the ideas they held in common. Bolingbroke approved of the idea, and
went so far as to furnish the poet with seven or eight sheets of notes "to direct the plan
in general and to supply matter for particular epistles." Lord Bathurst, who knew both Pope
and Bolingbroke, went so far as to say in later years that the 'Essay' was originally composed
by Bolingbroke in prose and that Pope only put it into verse. But this is undoubtedly an exaggeration
of what Pope himself frankly acknowledged, that the poem was composed under the influence of
Bolingbroke, that in the main it reflected his opinions, and that Bolingbroke had assisted
him in the general plan and in numerous details. Very properly, therefore, the poem is addressed
to Bolingbroke and begins and closes with a direct address to the poet's "guide, philosopher,
and friend."

This is an atom: 
In substance the 'Essay on Man' is a discussion of the moral order of the world. Its purpose
is "to vindicate the ways of God to man," and it may therefore be regarded as an attempt to
confute the skeptics who argued from the existence of evil in the world and the wretchedness
of man's existence to the impossibility of belief in an all-good and all-wise God. It attempts
to do this, not by an appeal to revelation or the doctrines of Christianity, but simply on
the basis of a common-sense interpretation of the facts of existence.

This is an atom: 
A brief outline of the poem will show the general tenor of Pope's argument.

This is an atom: 
The first epistle deals with the nature and state of man with respect to the universe. It insists
on the limitations of man's knowledge, and the consequent absurdity of his presuming to murmur
against God. It teaches that the universe was not made for man, but that man with all his apparent
imperfections is exactly fitted to the place which he occupies in the universe. In the physical
universe all things work together for good, although certain aspects of nature seem evil to
man, and likewise in the moral universe all things, even man's passions and crimes conduce
to the general good of the whole. Finally it urges calm submission and acquiescence in what
is hard to understand, since "one truth is clear,--whatever is, is right."

This is an atom: 
The second epistle deals with the nature of man as an individual. It begins by urging men to
abandon vain questionings of God's providence and to take up the consideration of their own
natures, for "the proper study of mankind is man." Pope points out that the two cardinal principles
of man's nature are self-love and reason, the first an impelling, the second a regulating power.
The aim of both these principles is pleasure, by which Pope means happiness, which he takes
for the highest good. Each man is dominated by a master passion, and it is the proper function
of reason to control this passion for good and to make it bear fruit in virtue. No man is wholly
virtuous or vicious, and Heaven uses the mingled qualities of men to bind them together in
mutual interdependence, and makes the various passions and imperfections of mankind serve the
general good. And the final conclusion is that "though man's a fool, yet God is wise."

This is an atom: 
The third epistle treats of the nature of man with respect to society. All creatures, Pope
asserts, are bound together and live not for themselves alone, but man is preeminently a social
being. The first state of man was the state of nature when he lived in innocent ignorance with
his fellow-creatures. Obeying the voice of nature, man learned to copy and improve upon the
instincts of the animals, to build, to plow, to spin, to unite in societies like those of ants
and bees. The first form of government was patriarchal; then monarchies arose in which virtue,
"in arms or arts," made one man ruler over many. In either case the origin of true government
as of true religion was love. Gradually force crept in and uniting with superstition gave rise
to tyranny and false religions. Poets and patriots, however, restored the ancient faith and
taught power's due use by showing the necessity of harmony in the state. Pope concludes by
asserting the folly of contention for forms of government or modes of faith. The common end
of government as of religion is the general good. It may be noticed in passing that Pope's
account of the evolution of society bears even less relation to historical facts than does
his account of the development of literature in the 'Essay on Criticism.'

This is an atom: 
The last epistle discusses the nature of happiness, "our being's end and aim." Happiness is
attainable by all men who think right and mean well. It consists not in individual, but in
mutual pleasure. It does not consist in external things, mere gifts of fortune, but in health,
peace, and competence. Virtuous men are, indeed, subject to calamities of nature; but God cannot
be expected to suspend the operation of general laws to spare the virtuous. Objectors who would
construct a system in which all virtuous men are blest, are challenged to define the virtuous
and to specify what is meant by blessings. Honors, nobility, fame, superior talents, often
merely serve to make their possessors unhappy. Virtue alone is happiness, and virtue consists
in a recognition of the laws of Providence, and in love for one's fellow-man.

This is an atom: 
Even this brief outline will show, I think, some of the inconsistencies and omissions of Pope's
train of thought. A careful examination of his arguments in detail would be wholly out of place
here. The reader who wishes to pursue the subject further may consult Warburton's elaborate
vindication of Pope's argument, and Elwin's equally prosy refutation, or better still the admirable
summary by Leslie Stephen in the chapter on this poem in his life of Pope ('English Men of
Letters'). No one is now likely to turn to the writer of the early eighteenth century for a
system of the universe, least of all to a writer so incapable of exact or systematic thinking
as Alexander Pope. If the 'Essay on Man' has any claim to be read to-day, it must be as a piece
of literature pure and simple. For philosophy and poetry combined, Browning and Tennyson lie
nearer to our age and mode of thought than Pope.

This is an atom: 
Even regarded as a piece of literature the 'Essay on Man' cannot, I think, claim the highest
place among Pope's works. It obtained, indeed, a success at home and abroad such as was achieved
by no other English poem until the appearance of 'Childe Harold'. It was translated into French,
German, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, and Latin. It was imitated by Wieland, praised by Voltaire,
and quoted by Kant. But this success was due in part to the accuracy with which it reflected
ideas which were the common property of its age, in part to the extraordinary vigor and finish
of its epigrams, which made it one of the most quotable of English poems. But as a whole the
Essay is not a great poem. The poet is evidently struggling with a subject that is too weighty
for him, and at times he staggers and sinks beneath his burden. The second and third books
in particular are, it must be confessed, with the exception of one or two fine outbursts, little
better than dull, and dullness is not a quality one is accustomed to associate with Pope. The
'Essay on Man' lacks the bright humor and imaginative artistry of 'The Rape of the Lock,' and
the lively portraiture, vigorous satire, and strong personal note of the 'Moral Epistles' and
'Imitations of Horace'. Pope is at his best when he is dealing with a concrete world of men
and women as they lived and moved in the London of his day; he is at his worst when he is attempting
to seize and render abstract ideas.

This is an atom: 
Yet the 'Essay on Man' is a very remarkable work. In the first place, it shows Pope's wonderful
power of expression. No one can read the poem for the first time without meeting on page after
page phrases and epigrams which have become part of the common currency of our language. Pope's
"precision and firmness of touch," to quote the apt statement of Leslie Stephen, "enables him
to get the greatest possible meaning into a narrow compass. He uses only one epithet, but it
is the right one." Even when the thought is commonplace enough, the felicity of the expression
gives it a new and effective force. And there are whole passages where Pope rises high above
the mere coining of epigrams. As I have tried to show in my notes he composed by separate paragraphs,
and when he chances upon a topic that appeals to his imagination or touches his heart, we get
an outburst of poetry that shines in splendid contrast to the prosaic plainness of its surroundings.
Such, for example, are the noble verses that tell of the immanence of God in his creation at
the close of the first epistle, or the magnificent invective against tyranny and superstition
in the third (ll. 241-268).

This is an atom: 
Finally the 'Essay on Man' is of interest in what it tells us of Pope himself. Mr. Elwin's
idea that in the 'Essay on Man' Pope, "partly the dupe, partly the accomplice of Bolingbroke,"
was attempting craftily to undermine the foundations of religion, is a notion curiously compounded
of critical blindness and theological rancor. In spite of all its incoherencies and futilities
the 'Essay' is an honest attempt to express Pope's opinions, borrowed in part, of course, from
his admired friend, but in part the current notions of his age, on some of the greatest questions
that have perplexed the mind of man. And Pope's attitude toward the questions is that of the
best minds of his day, at once religious, independent, and sincere. He acknowledges the omnipotence
and benevolence of God, confesses the limitations and imperfections of human knowledge, teaches
humility in the presence of unanswerable problems, urges submission to Divine Providence, extols
virtue as the true source of happiness, and love of man as an essential of virtue. If we study
the 'Essay on Man' as the reasoned argument of a philosopher, we shall turn from it with something
like contempt; if we read it as the expression of a poet's sentiments, we shall, I think, leave
it with an admiration warmer than before for a character that has been so much abused and so
little understood as that of Pope.

Pope here takes it for granted that our universe, inasmuch as it is the work of God's infinite

must have a place somewhere in this system, and the only question is whether "God has placed
him wrong."

His knowledge, for example, is measured by the brief time he has to live and the brief space

This is an atom: 
These lines are really out of place. They first appeared after l. 98; then Pope struck them
out altogether. Just before his death he put them into their present place on the advice of
Warburton, who probably approved of them because of their reference to a future state of bliss.
It is plain that they interfere with the regular argument of the poem.

This is an atom: 
'97 from home:'

This is an atom: 
away from its true home, the life to come. This line represents one of the alterations which
Warburton induced Pope to make. The poet first wrote "confined at home," thus representing
this life as the home of the soul. His friend led him to make the change in order to express
more clearly his belief in the soul's immortality.

This is an atom: 
In this famous passage Pope shows how the belief in immortality is found even among the most

or God working through Nature, could have implanted this conception in the Indian's mind.

This is an atom: 
Pope means that the ignorant Indian had no conception of a heaven reserved for the just such
as Greek sages and Christian believers have. All he believes in is "an humbler heaven," where
he shall be free from the evils of this life. Line 108 has special reference to the tortures
inflicted upon the natives of Mexico and Peru by the avaricious Spanish conquerors.

In this passage Pope blames those civilized men who, though they should be wiser than the Indian,
murmur against the decrees of God. The imperative verbs "weigh," "call," "say," etc., are used
satirically.

This is an atom: 
'131-172'

This is an atom: 
In this passage Pope imagines a dialogue between one of the proud murmurers he has described
and himself. His opponent insists that the world was made primarily for man's enjoyment (ll.
132-140). Pope asks whether nature does not seem to swerve from this end of promoting human
happiness in times of pestilence, earthquake, and tempest (ll. 141-144). The other answers
that these are only rare exceptions to the general laws, due perhaps to some change in nature
since the world began (ll. 145-148). Pope replies by asking why there should not be exceptions
in the moral as well as in the physical world; may not great villains be compared to terrible
catastrophes in nature (ll. 148-156)? He goes on to say that no one but God can answer this
question, that our human reasoning springs from pride, and that the true course of reasoning
is simply to submit (ll. 156-164). He then suggests that "passions," by which he means vices,
are as necessary a part of the moral order as storms of the physical world (ll. 165-172).

This is an atom: 
In this section Pope reproves those who are dissatisfied with man's faculties. He points out
that all animals, man included, have powers suited to their position in the world (ll. 179-188),
and asserts that if man had keener senses than he now has, he would be exposed to evils from
which he now is free (ll. 193-203).

This is an atom: 
'199 quick effluvia':

This is an atom: 
pungent odors. The construction is very condensed here; "effluvia" may be regarded like "touch"
as a subject of "were given" (l. 195); but one would expect rather a phrase to denote a keener
sense of smell than man now possesses.

This is an atom: 
'202 music of the spheres':

This is an atom: 
it was an old belief that the stars and planets uttered musical notes as they moved along their
courses. These notes made up the "harmony of the spheres." Shakespeare ('Merchant of Venice',
V, 64-5) says that our senses are too dull to hear it. Pope, following a passage in Cicero's
'Somnium Scipionis', suggests that this music is too loud for human senses.

This is an atom: 
'207-232'

This is an atom: 
Pope now goes on to show how in the animal world there is an exact gradation of the faculties
of sense and of the powers of instinct. Man alone is endowed with reason which is more than
equivalent to all these powers and makes him lord over all animals.

This is an atom:

The mole is almost blind; the lynx was supposed to be the most keen-sighted of animals.

not very clear.

This is an atom: 
'233-258'

This is an atom: 
In this passage Pope insists that the chain of being stretches unbroken from God through man
to the lowest created forms. If any link in this chain were broken, as would happen if men
possessed higher faculties than are now assigned them, the whole universe would be thrown into
confusion. This is another answer to those who complain of the imperfections of man's nature.

Inferior beings might then press upon us. If they did not, a fatal gap would be left by our
ascent in the scale.

This is an atom: 
'247 each system:'

This is an atom: 
Pope imagines the universe to be composed of an infinite number of systems like ours. Since
each of these is essential to the orderly arrangement of the universe, any disorder such as
he has imagined would have infinitely destructive consequences. These are described in ll. 251-257.

This is an atom: 
'267-280'

This is an atom: 
In these lines Pope speaks of God as the soul of the world in an outburst of really exalted
enthusiasm that is rare enough in his work.

a relative pronoun referring to "soul," l. 268.

This is an atom: 
'270 th' ethereal frame:' the heavens.

This is an atom: 
'276 as perfect in a hair as heart:'

This is an atom: 
this has been called "a vile antithesis," on the ground that there is no reason why hair and
heart should be contrasted. But Pope may have had in mind the saying of Christ. "the very hairs
of your head are all numbered." The hairs are spoken of here as the least important part of
the body; the heart, on the other hand, has always been thought of as the most important organ.
There is, therefore, a real antithesis between the two.

This is an atom: 
'278 Seraph ... burns:'

This is an atom: 
the seraphim according to old commentators are on fire with the love of God.

This is an atom: 
'280 equals all:'

This is an atom: 
makes all things equal. This does not seem consistent with the idea of the gradations of existence
which Pope has been preaching throughout this Epistle. Possibly it means that all things high
and low are filled alike with the divine spirit and in this sense all things are equal. But
one must not expect to find exact and consistent philosophy in the 'Essay on Man'.

This is an atom:

AN EPISTLE TO DR ARBUTHNOT

This is an atom: 
INTRODUCTION

This is an atom: 
Next to 'The Rape of the Lock', I think, the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot' is the most interesting
and the most important of Pope's poems--the most important since it shows the master poet of
the age employing his ripened powers in the field most suitable for their display, that of
personal satire, the most interesting, because, unlike his former satiric poem the 'Dunciad',
it is not mere invective, but gives us, as no other poem of Pope's can be said to do, a portrait
of the poet himself.

This is an atom: 
Like most of Pope's poems, the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot' owes its existence to an objective cause.
This was the poet's wish to justify himself against a series of savage attacks, which had recently
been directed against him. If Pope had expected by the publication of the 'Dunciad' to crush
the herd of scribblers who had been for years abusing him, he must have been woefully disappointed.
On the contrary, the roar of insult and calumny rose louder than ever, and new voices were
added to the chorus. In the year 1733 two enemies entered the field against Pope such as he
had never yet had to encounter--enemies of high social position, of acknowledged wit, and of
a certain, though as the sequel proved quite inadequate, talent for satire. Other women can
play gracefully the head of the establishment; but who, like them,
could be head, hand, and foot, all at once?

This is an atom: 
As I have spoken of stoves, I will here remark that I have not yet seen one in England; neither, so
far as I can remember, have I seen a house warmed by a furnace. Bright coal fires, in grates of
polished steel, are as yet the lares and penates of old England. If I am inclined to mourn
over any defection in my own country, it is the closing up of the cheerful open fire, with
its bright lights and dancing shadows, and the planting on our domestic hearth of that sullen,
stifling gnome, the air-tight. I agree with Hawthorne in thinking the movement fatal to patriotism;
for who would fight for an airtight!

LETTER XXI
May 13. Dear father:--
To-day we are to go out to visit your Quaker friend, Mr. Alexander, at Stoke Newington, where you
passed so many pleasant hours during your sojourn in England. At half past nine we went
into the Congregational Union, which is now in session. I had a seat upon the platform, where I could
command a view of the house. It was a most interesting assemblage to me, recalling forcibly our
New England associations, and impressing more than ever on my mind how much of one blood the two
countries are. These earnest, thoughtful, intelligent-looking men seemed to transport me back to
my own country. They received us with most gratifying cordiality and kindness. Most naturally
Congregationalism in England must turn with deep interest and sympathy to Congregationalism
in America. In several very cordial addresses they testified their pleasure at seeing us
among them, speaking most affectionately of you and your labors, and your former visit to
England. The wives and daughters of many of them present expressed in their countenances the
deepest and most affectionate feeling. It is cheering to feel that an ocean does not divide our
hearts, and that the Christians of America and England are one.

This is an atom: 
In the afternoon we drove out to Mr. Alexander's. His place is called Paradise, and very justly,
being one more of those home Edens in which England abounds, where, without ostentation or display,
every appliance of rational enjoyment surrounds one.
We were ushered into a cheerful room, opening by one glass door
upon a brilliant conservatory of flowers, and by another upon a
neatly-kept garden. The air was fresh and sweet with the perfume
of blossoming trees, and every thing seemed doubly refreshing from
the contrast with the din and smoke of London. Our chamber looked
out upon a beautiful park, shaded with fine old trees.He was effeminate in habits and appearance, but
notoriously licentious; he affected to scoff at learning but made some pretense to literature,
and had written 'Four Epistles after the Manner of Ovid', and numerous political pamphlets.
Pope, who had some slight personal acquaintance with him, disliked his political connections
and probably despised his verses, and in the 'Imitation' already mentioned had alluded to him
under the title of Lord Fanny as capable of turning out a thousand lines of verse a day. This
was sufficient cause, if cause were needed, to induce Hervey to join Lady Mary in her warfare
against Pope.

This is an atom: 
The first blow was struck in an anonymous poem, probably the combined work of the two allies,
called 'Verses addressed to the Imitator of Horace', which appeared in March, 1733, and it
was followed up in August by an 'Epistle from a Nobleman to a Doctor of Divinity', which also
appeared anonymously, but was well known to be the work of Lord Hervey. In these poems Pope
was abused in the most unmeasured terms. His work was styled a mere collection of libels; he
had no invention except in defamation; he was a mere pretender to genius. His morals were not
left unimpeached; he was charged with selling other men's work printed in his name,--a gross
distortion of his employing assistants in the translation of the 'Odyssey',--he was ungrateful,
unjust, a foe to human kind, an enemy like the devil to all that have being. The noble authors,
probably well aware how they could give the most pain, proceeded to attack his family and his
distorted person. His parents were obscure and vulgar people; and he himself a wretched outcast:

This is an atom: 
with the emblem of [his] crooked mind
  Marked on [his] back like Cain by God's own hand.

This is an atom: 
And to cap the climax, as soon as these shameful libels were in print, Lord Hervey bustled
off to show them to the Queen and to laugh with her over the fine way in which he had put down
the bitter little poet.

This is an atom: 
In order to understand and appreciate Pope's reception of these attacks, we must recall to
ourselves the position in which he lived. He was a Catholic, and I have already (Introduction,
p. x) called attention to the precarious, tenure by which the Catholics of his time held their
goods, their persons, their very lives, in security. He was the intimate of Bolingbroke, of
all men living the most detested by the court, and his noble friends were almost without exception
the avowed enemies of the court party. Pope had good reason to fear that the malice of his
enemies might not be content to stop with abusive doggerel. But he was not in the least intimidated.
On the contrary, he broke out in a fine flame of wrath against Lord Hervey, whom he evidently
considered the chief offender, challenged his enemy to disavow the 'Epistle', and on his declining
to do so, proceeded to make what he called "a proper reply" in a prose 'Letter to a Noble Lord'.
This masterly piece of satire was passed about from hand to hand, but never printed. We are
told that Sir Robert Walpole, who found Hervey a convenient tool in court intrigues, bribed
Pope not to print it by securing a good position in France for one of the priests who had watched
over the poet's youth. If this story be true, and we have Horace Walpole's authority for it,
we may well imagine that the entry of the bribe, like that of Uncle Toby's oath, was blotted
out by a tear from the books of the Recording Angel.

This is an atom: 
But Pope was by no means disposed to let the attacks go without an answer of some kind, and
the particular form which his answer took seems to have been suggested by a letter from Arbuthnot.
"I make it my last request," wrote his beloved physician, now sinking fast under the diseases
that brought him to the grave, "that you continue that noble disdain and abhorrence of vice,
which you seem so naturally endued with, but still with a due regard to your own safety; and
study more to reform than to chastise, though the one often cannot be effected without the
other." "I took very kindly your advice," Pope replied, "... and it has worked so much upon
me considering the time and state you gave it in, that I determined to address to you one of
my epistles written by piecemeal many years, and which I have now made haste to put together;
wherein the question is stated, what were, and are my motives of writing, the objections to
them, and my answers." In other words, the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot' which we see that Pope was
working over at the date of this letter, August 25, 1734, was, in the old-fashioned phrase,
his 'Apologia', his defense of his life and work.

This is an atom: 
As usual, Pope's account of his work cannot be taken literally. A comparison of dates shows
that the 'Epistle' instead of having been "written by piecemeal many years" is essentially
the work of one impulse, the desire to vindicate his character, his parents, and his work from
the aspersions cast upon them by Lord Hervey and Lady Mary. The exceptions to this statement
are two, or possibly three, passages which we know to have been written earlier and worked
into the poem with infinite art.

This is an atom: 
The first of these is the famous portrait of Addison as Atticus. I have already spoken of the
reasons that led to Pope's breach with Addison (Introduction, p. xv); and there is good reason
to believe that this portrait sprang directly from Pope's bitter feeling toward the elder writer
for his preference of Tickell's translation. The lines were certainly written in Addison's
lifetime, though we may be permitted to doubt whether Pope really did send them to him, as
he once asserted. They did not appear in print, however, till four years after Addison's death,
when they were printed apparently without Pope's consent in a volume of miscellanies. It is
interesting to note that in this form the full name "Addison" appeared in the last line. Some
time later Pope acknowledged the verses and printed them with a few changes in his 'Miscellany'
of 1727, substituting the more decorous "A---n" for the "Addison" of the first text. Finally
he worked over the passage again and inserted it, for a purpose that will be shown later, in
the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot'.

This is an atom: 
It is not worth while to discuss here the justice or injustice of this famous portrait. In
fact, the question hardly deserves to be raised. The passage is admittedly a satire, and a
satire makes no claim to be a just and final sentence. Admitting, as we must, that Pope was
in the wrong in his quarrel with Addison, we may well admit that he has not done him full justice.
But we must equally admit that the picture is drawn with wonderful skill, that praise and blame
are deftly mingled, and that the satire is all the more severe because of its frank admission
of the great man's merits. And it must also be said that Pope has hit off some of the faults
of Addison's character,--his coldness, his self-complacency, his quiet sneer, his indulgence
of flattering fools--in a way that none of his biographers have done. That Pope was not blind
to Addison's chief merit as an author is fully shown by a passage in a later poem, less well
known than the portrait of Atticus, but well worth quotation. After speaking of the licentiousness
of literature in Restoration days, he goes on to say:

This is an atom: 
In our own (excuse some courtly stains)
  No whiter page than Addison's remains,
  He from the taste obscene reclaims our youth,
  And sets the passions on the side of truth,
  Forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art,
  And pours each human virtue in the heart.

'Epistle to Augustus, II'. 215-220.

This is an atom: 
If Pope was unjust to Addison the man, he at least made amends to Addison the moralist.

This is an atom: 
The second passage that may have had an independent existence before the 'Epistle' was conceived
is the portrait of Bufo, ll. 229-247. There is reason to believe that this attack was first
aimed at Bubb Doddington, a courtier of Hervey's class, though hardly of so finished a type,
to whom Pope alludes as Bubo in l. 278. When Pope was working on the 'Epistle', however, he
saw an opportunity to vindicate his own independence of patronage by a satiric portrait of
the great Maecenas of his younger days, Lord Halifax, who had ventured some foolish criticisms
on Pope's translation of the 'Iliad', and seems to have expected that the poet should dedicate
the great work to him in return for an offer of a pension which he made and Pope declined.
There is no reason to believe that Pope cherished any very bitter resentment toward Halifax.
On the contrary, in a poem published some years after the 'Epistle' he boasted of his friendship
with Halifax, naming him outright, and adding in a note that the noble lord was no less distinguished
by his love of letters than his abilities in Parliament.

This is an atom: 
The third passage, a tender reference to his mother's age and weakness, was written at least
as early as 1731,--Mrs. Pope died in 1733,--and was incorporated in the 'Epistle' to round
it off with a picture of the poet absorbed in his filial duties at the very time that Hervey
and Lady Mary were heaping abuse upon him, as a monster devoid of all good qualities. And now
having discussed the various insertions in the 'Epistle', let us look for a moment at the poem
as a whole, and see what is the nature of Pope's defense of himself and of his reply to his
enemies.

This is an atom: 
It is cast in the form of a dialogue between the poet himself and Arbuthnot. Pope begins by
complaining of the misfortunes which his reputation as a successful man of letters has brought
upon him. He is a mark for all the starving scribblers of the town who besiege him for advice,
recommendations, and hard cash. Is it not enough to make a man write 'Dunciads?' Arbuthnot
warns him against the danger of making foes (ll. 101- 104), but Pope replies that his flatterers
are even more intolerable than his open enemies. And with a little outburst of impatience,
such as we may well imagine him to have indulged in during his later years, he cries:

This is an atom: 
Why did I write? What sin to me unknown
  Dipt me in ink, my parents' or my own?

This is an atom: 
and begins with l. 125 his poetical autobiography. He tells of his first childish efforts,
of poetry taken up "to help me thro' this long disease my life," and then goes on to speak
of the noble and famous friends who had praised his early work and urged him to try his fortune
in the open field of letters. He speaks of his first poems, the 'Pastorals' and 'Windsor Forest',
harmless as Hervey's own verses, and tells how even then critics like Dennis fell foul of him.
Rival authors hated him, too, especially such pilfering bards as Philips. This he could endure,
but the coldness and even jealousy of such a man as Addison--and here appears the famous portrait
of Atticus--was another matter, serious enough to draw tears from all lovers of mankind.

This is an atom: 
Passing on (l. 213) to the days of his great success when his 'Homer' was the talk of the town,
he asserts his ignorance of all the arts of puffery and his independence of mutual admiration
societies. He left those who wished a patron to the tender mercies of Halifax, who fed fat
on flattery and repaid his flatterers merely with a good word or a seat at his table. After
all, the poet could afford to lose the society of Bufo's toadies while such a friend as Gay
was left him (l. 254).

This is an atom: 
After an eloquent expression of his wish for independence (ll. 261-270), he goes on to speak
of the babbling friends who insist that he is always meditating some new satire, and persist
in recognizing some wretched poetaster's lampoon as his. And so by a natural transition Pope
comes to speak of his own satiric poems and their aims. He says, and rightly, that he has never
attacked virtue or innocence. He reserves his lash for those who trample on their neighbors
and insult "fallen worth," for cold or treacherous friends, liars, and babbling blockheads.
Let Sporus (Hervey) tremble (l. 303). Arbuthnot interposes herewith an ejaculation of contemptuous
pity; is it really worth the poet's while to castigate such a slight thing as Hervey, that
"mere white curd"? But Pope has suffered too much from Hervey's insolence to stay his hand,
and he now proceeds to lay on the lash with equal fury and precision, drawing blood at every
stroke, until we seem to see the wretched fop writhing and shrieking beneath the whip. And
then with a magnificent transition he goes on (ll. 332-337) to draw a portrait of himself.
Here, he says in effect, is the real man that Sporus has so maligned. The portrait is idealized,
of course; one could hardly expect a poet speaking in his own defense in reply to venomous
attacks to dissect his own character with the stern impartiality of the critics of the succeeding
century, but it is in all essentials a portrait at once impressive and true.

This is an atom: 
Arbuthnot again interrupts (l. 358) to ask why he spares neither the poor nor the great in
his satire, and Pope replies that he hates knaves in every rank of life. Yet by nature, he
insists, he is of an easy temper, more readily deceived than angered, and in a long catalogue
of instances he illustrates his own patience and good nature (ll. 366-385). It must be frankly
confessed that these lines do not ring true. Pope might in the heat of argument convince himself
that he was humble and slow to wrath, but he has never succeeded in convincing his readers.

This is an atom: 
With l. 382 Pope turns to the defense of his family, which, as we have seen, his enemies had
abused as base and obscure. He draws a noble picture of his dead father, "by nature honest,
by experience wise" simple, modest, and temperate, and passes to the description of himself
watching over the last years of his old mother, his sole care to

"If he should determine upon a career involving manual work, I
should take steps to have him initiated into the Art and Mystery
of Bricklaying.There is
nothing like it in our language except Pope's other satires, and of all his satires it is,
by common consent, easily the first. It surpasses the satiric poetry of Dryden in pungency
and depth of feeling as easily as it does that of Byron in polish and artistic restraint. Its
range of tone is remarkable. At times it reads like glorified conversation, as in the opening
lines; at times it flames and quivers with emotion, as in the assault on Hervey, or in the
defense of his parents. Even in the limited field of satiric portraiture there is a wide difference
between the manner in which Pope has drawn the portrait of Atticus and that of Sporus. The
latter is a masterpiece of pure invective; no allowances are made, no lights relieve the darkness
of the shadows, the portrait is frankly inhuman. It is the product of an unrestrained outburst
of bitter passion. The portrait of Atticus, on the other hand, was, as we know, the work of
years. It is the product not of an outburst of fury, but of a slowly growing and intense dislike,
which, while recognizing the merits of its object, fastened with peculiar power upon his faults
and weaknesses. The studious restraint which controls the satirist's hand makes it only the
more effective. We know well enough that the portrait is not a fair one, but we are forced
to remind ourselves of this at every step to avoid the spell which Pope's apparent impartiality
casts over our judgments. The whole passage reads not so much like the heated plea of an advocate
as the measured summing-up of a judge, and the last couplet falls on our ears with the inevitability
of a final sentence. But the peculiar merit of the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot' consists neither
in the ease and polish of its style, nor in the vigor and effectiveness of its satire, but
in the insight it gives us into the heart and mind of the poet himself. It presents an ideal
picture of Pope, the man and the author, of his life, his friendships, his love of his parents,
his literary relationships and aims. And it is quite futile to object, as some critics have
done, that this picture is not exactly in accordance with the known facts of Pope's life. No
great man can be tried and judged on the mere record of his acts. We must know the circumstances
that shaped these, and the motives that inspired them. A man's ideals, if genuinely held and
honestly followed, are perhaps even more valuable contributions to our final estimate of the
man himself than all he did or left undone.

he lived.

his tomb in Westminster Abbey. It is to this that he alludes in l. 258.

'297-298'

This is an atom: 
In the Fourth Moral Essay, published in 1731 as an 'Epistle to the Earl of Burlington', Pope
had given a satirical description of a nobleman's house and grounds, adorned and laid out at
vast expense, but in bad taste. Certain features of this description were taken from Canons,
the splendid country place of the Duke of Chandos, and the duke was at once identified by a
scandal-loving public with the Timon of the poem. In the description Pope speaks of the silver
bell which calls worshipers to Timon's chapel, and of the soft Dean preaching there "who never
mentions Hell to ears polite." In this passage of the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot' he is protesting
against the people who swore that they could identify the bell and the Dean as belonging to
the chapel at Canons.

used to meet at the house of the Blounts. He wrote a comedy, 'The Rival Modes', in which he
introduced six lines that Pope had written. Pope apparently had given him leave to do so, and
then retracted his permission. But Moore used them without the permission and an undignified
quarrel arose as to the true authorship of the passage.

ODE ON SOLITUDE

This is an atom: 
Pope says that this delightful little poem was written at the early age of twelve. It first
appeared in a letter to his friend, Henry Cromwell, dated July 17, 1709. There are several
variations between this first form and that in which it was finally published, and it is probable
that Pope thought enough of his boyish production to subject it to repeated revision. Its spirit
is characteristic of a side of Pope's nature that is often forgotten. He was, indeed, the poet
of the society of his day, urban, cultured, and pleasure-loving; but to the end of his days
he retained a love for the quiet charm of country life which he had come to feel in his boyhood
at Binfield, and for which he early withdrew from the whirl and dissipations of London to the
groves and the grotto of his villa at Twickenham.

NOTES ON

This is an atom: 
THE DESCENT OF DULLNESS

This is an atom: 
In the fourth book of the 'Dunciad', Pope abandons the satire on the pretenders to literary
fame which had run through the earlier books, and flies at higher game. He represents the Goddess
Dullness as "coming in her majesty to destroy Order and Science, and to substitute the Kingdom
of the Dull upon earth." He attacks the pedantry and formalism of university education in his
day, the dissipation and false taste of the traveled gentry, the foolish pretensions to learning
of collectors and virtuosi, and the daringly irreverent speculations of freethinkers and infidels.
At the close of the book he represents the Goddess as dismissing her worshipers with a speech
which she concludes with "a yawn of extraordinary virtue." Under its influence "all nature
nods," and pulpits, colleges, and Parliament succumb. The poem closes with the magnificent
description of the descent of Dullness and her final conquest of art, philosophy, and religion.
It is said that Pope himself admired these lines so much that he could not repeat them without
his voice faltering with emotion. "And well it might, sir," said Dr. Johnson when this anecdote
was repeated to him, "for they are noble lines." And Thackeray in his lecture on Pope in 'The
English Humorists' says:

This is an atom: 
"In these astonishing lines Pope reaches, I think, to the very
  greatest height which his sublime art has attained, and shows himself
  the equal of all poets of all times. It is the brightest ardor, the
  loftiest assertion of truth, the most generous wisdom, illustrated by
  the noblest poetic figure, and spoken in words the aptest, grandest,
  and most harmonious."

EPITAPH ON GAY

This is an atom: 
John Gay, the idlest, best-natured, and best-loved man of letters of his day, was the special
friend of Pope. His early work, 'The Shepherd's Week', was planned as a parody on the 'Pastorals'
of Pope's rival, Ambrose Philips, and Pope assisted him in the composition of his luckless
farce, 'Three Hours after Marriage'. When Gay's opera 'Polly' was forbidden by the licenser,
and Gay's patrons, the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry, were driven from court for soliciting
subscriptions for him, Pope warmly espoused his cause. Gay died in 1732 and was buried in Westminster
Abbey. Pope's epitaph for his tomb was first published in the quarto edition of Pope's works
in 1735--Johnson, in his discussion of Pope's epitaphs ('Lives of the Poets'), devotes a couple
of pages of somewhat captious criticism to these lines; but they have at least the virtue of
simplicity and sincerity, and are at once an admirable portrait of the man and a lasting tribute
to the poet Gay.

CANTO I

This is an atom: 
What dire offence from am'rous causes springs,
  What mighty quarrels rise from trivial things,
  I sing--This verse to C--l, Muse! is due:
  This, ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view:
  Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,                    5
  If she inspire, and he approve my lays.

This is an atom: 
Say what strange motive, goddess! could compel
  A well-bred lord t' assault a gentle belle?
  O say what stranger cause, yet unexplored,
  Could make a gentle belle reject a lord?                        10
  And dwells such rage in softest bosoms then,
  And lodge such daring souls in little men?

This is an atom: 
Sol through white curtains did his beams display,
  And ope'd those eyes which brighter shine than they,
  Shock just had giv'n himself the rousing shake,                 15
  And nymphs prepared their chocolate to take;
  Thrice the wrought slipper knocked against the ground,
  And striking watches the tenth hour resound.
  Belinda rose, and midst attending dames,
  Launched on the bosom of the silver Thames:                     20
  A train of well-dressed youths around her shone,
  And ev'ry eye was fixed on her alone:
  On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore
  Which Jews might kiss and infidels adore.
  Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,                     25
  Quick as her eyes, and as unfixed as those:
  Favours to none, to all she smiles extends;
  Oft she rejects, but never once offends.
  Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,
  And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.                     30
  Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride,
  Might hide her faults, if belles had faults to hide:
  If to her share some female errors fall,
  Look on her face, and you'll forgive 'em all.

This is an atom: 
This nymph, to the destruction of mankind,                      35
  Nourished two locks, which graceful hung behind
  In equal curls, and well conspired to deck
  With shining ringlets her smooth iv'ry neck.
  Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains,
  And mighty hearts are held in slender chains.                   40
  With hairy springes we the birds betray,
  Slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey,
  Fair tresses man's imperial race insnare,
  And beauty draws us with a single hair.

This is an atom: 
Th' adventurous baron the bright locks admired;                 45
  He saw, he wished, and to the prize aspired.
  Resolved to win, he meditates the way,
  By force to ravish, or by fraud betray;
  For when success a lover's toil attends,
  Few ask if fraud or force attained his ends.                    50

This is an atom: 
For this, ere Phoebus rose, he had implored
  Propitious heav'n, and every pow'r adored,
  But chiefly Love--to Love an altar built,
  Of twelve vast French romances, neatly gilt.
  There lay the sword-knot Sylvia's hands had sewn                55
  With Flavia's busk that oft had wrapped his own:
  A fan, a garter, half a pair of gloves,
  And all the trophies of his former loves.
  With tender billets-doux he lights the pire,
  And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire.             60
  Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes
  Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize:
  The pow'rs gave ear, and granted half his pray'r,
  The rest the winds dispersed in empty air.

This is an atom: 
Close by those meads, for ever crowned with flow'rs,            65
  Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs,
  There stands a structure of majestic frame,
  Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name.
  Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom
  Of foreign tyrants, and of nymphs at home;                      70
  Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey,
  Dost sometimes counsel take--and sometimes tea.

This is an atom: 
Hither our nymphs and heroes did resort,
  To taste awhile the pleasures of a court;
  In various talk the cheerful hours they passed,                 75
  Of who was bit, or who capotted last;
  This speaks the glory of the British queen,
  And that describes a charming Indian screen;
  A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;
  At ev'ry word a reputation dies.                                80
  Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,
  With singing, laughing, ogling, and all that.

This is an atom: 
Now when, declining from the noon of day,
  The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;
  When hungry judges soon the sentence sign,                      85
  And wretches hang that jurymen may dine;
  When merchants from th' Exchange return in peace,
  And the long labours of the toilet cease,
  The board's with cups and spoons, alternate, crowned,
  The berries crackle, and the mill turns round;                  90
  On shining altars of Japan they raise
  The silver lamp, and fiery spirits blaze:
  From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,
  While China's earth receives the smoking tide.
  At once they gratify their smell and taste,                     95
  While frequent cups prolong the rich repast.
  Coffee (which makes the politician wise,
  And see through all things with his half-shut eyes)
  Sent up in vapours to the baron's brain
  New stratagems, the radiant lock to gain.                      100
  Ah cease, rash youth! desist ere't is too late,
  Fear the just gods, and think of Scylla's fate!
  Changed to a bird, and sent to flit in air,
  She dearly pays for Nisus' injured hair!

But when to mischief mortals bend their mind,                  105
  How soon fit instruments of ill they find!
  Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace
  A two-edged weapon from her shining case:
  So ladies, in romance, assist their knight,
  Present the spear, and arm him for the fight;                  110
  He takes the gift with rev'rence, and extends
  The little engine on his fingers' ends;
  This just behind Belinda's neck he spread,
  As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head.
  He first expands the glitt'ring forfex wide                    115
  T' enclose the lock; then joins it, to divide;
  One fatal stroke the sacred hair does sever
  From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!

This is an atom: 
The living fires come flashing from her eyes,
  And screams of horror rend th' affrighted skies.               120

  Or when rich china vessels, fall'n from high,

"Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine,"                 125

  As long as Atalantis shall be read,
  Or the small pillow grace a lady's bed,                        130

  Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,
  And hew triumphal arches to the ground.                        140

But anxious cares the pensive nymph oppressed,

  Not youthful kings in battle seized alive,
  Not scornful virgins who their charms survive,
  Not ardent lover robbed of all his bliss,                       5
  Not ancient lady when refused a kiss,
  Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die,
  Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinned awry,
  E'er felt such rage, resentment, and despair,
  As thou, sad virgin! for thy ravished hair.                    10

This is an atom: 
While her racked soul repose and peace requires,
  The fierce Thalestris fans the rising fires.
  "O wretched maid!" she spread her hands, and cried,
  (And Hampton's echoes, "Wretched maid!" replied)
  "Was it for this you took such constant care                   15
  Combs, bodkins, leads, pomatums to prepare?
  For this your locks in paper durance bound?
  For this with tort'ring irons wreathed around?
  Oh had the youth been but content to seize
  Hairs less in sight, or any hairs but these!                   20
  Gods! shall the ravisher display this hair,
  While the fops envy, and the ladies stare!
  Honour forbid! at whose unrivalled shrine
  Ease, pleasure, virtue, all, our sex resign.
  Methinks already I your tears survey,                          25
  Already hear the horrid things they say,
  Already see you a degraded toast,
  And all your honour in a whisper lost!
  How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend?
  'T will then be infamy to seem your friend!                    30
  And shall this prize, th' inestimable prize,
  Exposed through crystal to the gazing eyes,
  And heightened by the diamond's circling rays,
  On that rapacious hand for ever blaze?
  Sooner shall grass in Hyde Park Circus grow,                   35
  And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow;
  Sooner let earth, air, sea, to chaos fall,
  Men, monkeys, lapdogs, parrots, perish all!"

  With earnest eyes, and round unthinking face,
  He first the snuff-box opened, then the case,
  And thus broke out--"My lord, why, what the devil!             45
  Zounds! damn the lock! 'fore Gad, you must be civil!
  Plague on't! 't is past a jest--nay, prithee, pox!

"It grieves me much," replied the peer again,
  "Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain:                 50
  But by this lock, this sacred lock, I swear,
  (Which never more shall join its parted hair;
  Which never more its honours shall renew,
  Clipped from the lovely head where once it grew)
  That, while my nostrils draw the vital air,                    55
  This hand, which won it, shall for ever wear."
  He spoke, and speaking, in proud triumph spread
  The long-contended honours of her head.

But see! the nymph in sorrow's pomp appears,
  Her eyes half-languishing, half drowned in tears;              60
  Now livid pale her cheeks, now glowing red
  On her heaved bosom hung her drooping head,
  Which with a sigh she raised, and thus she said:
  "For ever cursed be this detested day,
  Which snatched my best, my fav'rite curl away;                 65
  Happy! ah ten times happy had I been,
  If Hampton Court these eyes had never seen!
  Yet am not I the first mistaken maid,
  By love of courts to num'rous ills betrayed.
  O had I rather unadmired remained                              70
  In some lone isle, or distant northern land,
  Where the gilt chariot never marked the way,
  Where none learn ombre, none e'er taste bohea!
  There kept my charms concealed from mortal eye,
  Like roses, that in deserts bloom and die.                     75
  What moved my mind with youthful lords to roam?
  O had I stayed, and said my pray'rs at home!
  'Twas this the morning omens did foretell,
  Thrice from my trembling hand the patchbox fell;
  The tott'ring china shook without a wind,                      80
  Nay, Poll sat mute, and Shock was most unkind!
  See the poor remnants of this slighted hair!
  My hands shall rend what ev'n thy own did spare:
  This in two sable ringlets taught to break,
  Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck;                      85
  The sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone,
  And in its fellow's fate foresees its own;
  Uncurled it hangs, the fatal shears demands,
  And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands."

  While Anna begged and Dido raged in vain.                      95
  "To arms, to arms!" the bold Thalestris cries,
  And swift as lightning to the combat flies.

  -------
SCENE: The kitchen of a farmhouse on the borderline between the
Southern and Northern states.
TIME: Ten o'clock in the evening, September, 1863.So when bold Homer makes the gods engage,
  And heav'nly breasts with human passions rage,                105
  'Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes arms,
  And all Olympus rings with loud alarms;
  Jove's thunder roars, heav'n trembles all around,
  Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps resound:
  Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs, the ground gives way,        110
  And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day!

This is an atom: 
While through the press enraged Thalestris flies,
  And scatters death around from both her eyes,
  A beau and witling perished in the throng,
  One died in metaphor, and one in song.                        115
  "O cruel nymph; a living death I bear,"
  Cried Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair.
  A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast,
  "Those eyes are made so killing"--was his last.
  Thus on MÃ¦ander's flow'ry margin lies                         120
  Th' expiring swan, and as he sings he dies.

This is an atom: 
As bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down,
  Chloe stepped in, and killed him with a frown;
  She smiled to see the doughty hero slain,
  But at her smile the beau revived again.                      125

This is an atom: 
Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air,
  Weighs the men's wits against the lady's hair;
  The doubtful beam long nods from side to side;
  At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside.

This is an atom: 
See fierce Belinda on the baron flies,                        130
  With more than usual lightning in her eyes:
  Nor feared the chief th' unequal fight to try,
  Who sought no more than on his foe to die.
  But this bold lord, with manly strength endued,
  She with one finger and a thumb subdued:                      135
  Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew,
  A charge of snuff the wily virgin threw;
  Sudden, with starting tears each eye o'erflows,
  And the high dome re-echoes to his nose.

This is an atom: 
"Now meet thy fate," th' incensed virago cried,               140
  And drew a deadly bodkin from her side.

This is an atom: 
"Boast not my fall," he said, "insulting foe!
  Thou by some other shalt be laid as low;
  Nor think to die dejects my lofty mind;
  All that I dread is leaving you behind!                       145
  Rather than so, ah let me still survive,
  And still burn on, in Cupid's flames, alive."

This is an atom: 
"Restore the lock!" she cries; and all around
  "Restore the lock!" the vaulted roofs rebound.
  Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain                        150
  Roared for the handkerchief that caused his pain.
  But see how oft ambitious aims are crossed,
  And chiefs contend till all the prize is lost!
  The lock, obtained with guilt, and kept with pain,
  In ev'ry place is sought, but sought in vain:                 155
  With such a prize no mortal must be blessed,
  So heav'n decrees! with heav'n who can contest?
  Some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere,
  Since all that man e'er lost is treasured there.
  There heroes' wits are kept in pond'rous vases,               160
  And beaux' in snuff-boxes and tweezer-cases.
  There broken vows, and death-bed alms are found,
  And lovers' hearts with ends of ribbon bound,
  The courtier's promises, and sick man's pray'rs,
  The smiles of harlots, and the tears of heirs,                165
  Cages for gnats, and chains to yoke a flea,
  Dried butterflies, and tomes of casuistry.

This is an atom: 
But trust the muse--she saw it upward rise,
  Though marked by none but quick poetic eyes:
  (Thus Rome's great founder to the heav'ns withdrew,           170
  To Proculus alone confessed in view)
  A sudden star, it shot through liquid air,
  And drew behind a radiant trail of hair.
  Not Berenice's locks first rose so bright,
  The skies bespangling with dishevelled light.                 175
  This the beau monde shall from the Mall survey,    }
  As through the moonlight shade they nightly stray, }
  And hail with music its propitious ray;            }
  This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies,
  When next he looks through Galileo's eyes;                    180
  And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom
  The fate of Louis, and the fall of Rome.

This is an atom: 
Then cease, bright nymph! to mourn thy ravished hair,
  Which adds new glory to the shining sphere!
  Not all the tresses that fair head can boast,                 185
  Shall draw such envy as the lock you lost.
  They have studied French people and
  French literature,--and studied it with enthusiasm,
  as people ever should, who would truly understand.
  They are all kindness to me. Whenever I wish to see any thing, I
  have only to speak; or to know, I have only
  to ask.

A DEDICATION

This is an atom: 
TO E.C.B.

This is an atom: 
He was, through boyhood's storm and shower,
    My best, my nearest friend;
  We wore one hat, smoked one cigar,
    One standing at each end.

This is an atom: 
We were two hearts with single hope,
    Two faces in one hood;
  I knew the secrets of his youth;
    I watched his every mood.

This is an atom: 
The little things that none but I
    Saw were beyond his wont,
  The streaming hair, the tie behind,
    The coat tails worn in front.

This is an atom: 
I marked the absent-minded scream,
    The little nervous trick
  Of rolling in the grate, with eyes
    By friendship's light made quick.

This is an atom: 
But youth's black storms are gone and past,
    Bare is each aged brow;
  And, since with age we're growing bald,
    Let us be babies now.

This is an atom: 
Learning we knew; but still to-day,
    With spelling-book devotion,
  Words of one syllable we seek
    In moments of emotion.

This is an atom: 
Riches we knew; and well dressed dolls--
    Dolls living--who expressed
  No filial thoughts, however much
    You thumped them in the chest.

This is an atom: 
Old happiness is grey as we,
    And we may still outstrip her;
  If we be slippered pantaloons,
    Oh let us hunt the slipper!

This is an atom: 
The old world glows with colours clear;
    And if, as saith the saint,
  The world is but a painted show,
    Oh let us lick the paint!

This is an atom: 
Far, far behind are morbid hours,
    And lonely hearts that bleed.
  Far, far behind us are the days,
    When we were old indeed.

This is an atom: 
Leave we the child: he is immersed
    With scientists and mystics:
  With deep prophetic voice he cries
    Canadian food statistics.

This is an atom: 
But now I know how few and small,
    The things we crave need be--
  Toys and the universe and you--
    A little friend to tea.

This is an atom: 
Behold the simple sum of things,
    Where, in one splendour spun,
  The stars go round the Mulberry Bush,
    The Burning Bush, the Sun.

This is an atom: 
Now we are old and wise and grey,
    And shaky at the knees;
  Now is the true time to delight
    In picture books like these.

This is an atom: 
Hoary and bent I dance one hour:
    What though I die at morn?
  There is a shout among the stars,
    "To-night a child is born."

THE ONENESS OF THE PHILOSOPHER WITH NATURE.

This is an atom: 
I love to see the little stars
    All dancing to one tune;
  I think quite highly of the Sun,
    And kindly of the Moon.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
The million forests of the Earth
    Come trooping in to tea.
  The great Niagara waterfall
    Is never shy with me.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
I am the tiger's confidant,
    And never mention names:
  The lion drops the formal "Sir,"
    And lets me call him James.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
Into my ear the blushing Whale
    Stammers his love. I know
  Why the Rhinoceros is sad,
    --Ah, child! Now a thing is present to us in two ways.

This is an atom: 
First, in knowledge--i.e. according as the thing known is in the
knower by its likeness; secondly, in reality--i.e. according as one
thing is in real conjunction of any kind with another, either
actually or potentially.

This is an atom: 
And since real conjunction
    is greater than conjunction
  by likeness, which is the
    conjunction of knowledge; and again, since actual is greater than
potential conjunction: therefore the greatest pleasure is that which
arises from sensation which requires the presence of the sensible
object.

This is an atom: 
The second place belongs to the pleasure of hope, wherein there is
pleasurable conjunction, not only in respect of apprehension, but
also in respect of the faculty or power of obtaining the pleasurable
object.

This is an atom: 
Come snow! where fly, by some strange law,
    Hard snowballs--without noise--
  Through streets untenanted, except
    By good unconscious boys.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
Come fog! exultant mystery--
    Where, in strange darkness rolled,
  The end of my own nose becomes
    A lovely legend old.

This is an atom: 
Come snow, and hail, and thunderbolts,
    Sleet, fire, and general fuss;
  Come to my arms, come all at once--
    Oh photograph me thus!

This is an atom: 
OF THE DANGERS ATTENDING ALTRUISM ON THE HIGH SEAS.

This is an atom: 
Observe these Pirates bold and gay,
    That sail a gory sea:
  Notice their bright expression:--
    The handsome one is me.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
We plundered ships and harbours,
    We spoiled the Spanish main;
  But Nemesis watched over us,
    For it began to rain.

This is an atom: 
Oh all well-meaning folk take heed!
    For as far as we who feel
  pleasure are concerned,
    change is pleasant to us because our nature is changeable:
for which reason that which is suitable to us at one time is not
suitable at another; thus to warm himself at a fire is suitable to
man in winter but not in summer.

This is an atom: 
Again, on the part of the pleasing
    good which is united to us,
  change is pleasant. Because the
    continued action of an agent increases its effect: thus the longer
a person remains near the fire, the more he is warmed and dried.

This is an atom: 
They fished him out; the First Mate wept,
    And came with rugs and ale:
  The Boatswain brought him one golosh,
    And fixed it on his tail.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration]

This is an atom: 
But yet he never loved the ship;
    Against the mast he'd lean;
  If spoken to, he coughed and smiled,
    And blushed a pallid green.

This is an atom: 
Though plied with hardbake, beef and beer,
    He showed no wish to sup:
  The neatest riddles they could ask,
    He always gave them up.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
They seized him and court-martialled him,
    In some excess of spleen,
  For lack of social sympathy,
    (Victoria xii. 18).

This is an atom: 
They gathered every evidence
    That might remove a doubt:
  They wrote a postcard in his name,
    And partly scratched it out.

This is an atom: 
Till, when his guilt was clear as day,
    With all formality
  They doomed the traitor to be drowned,
    And threw him in the sea.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
The flashing sunset, as he sank,
    Made every scale a gem;
  And, turning with a graceful bow,
    He kissed his fin to them.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
MORAL.

This is an atom: 
I am, I think I have remarked,
    Terrifically old,
  (The second Ice-age was a farce,
    The first was rather cold.)

This is an atom: 
A friend of mine, a trilobite
    Had gathered in his youth,
  When trilobites _were_ trilobites,
    This all-important truth.

This is an atom: 
We aged ones play solemn parts--
    Sire--guardian--uncle--king.
  Affection is the salt of life,
    Kindness a noble thing.

This is an atom: 
The old alone may comprehend
    A sense in my decree;
  But--if you find a fish on land,
    Oh throw it in the sea.

This is an atom: 
Ten years later, on one of the two bare patches of sand, another
BECHE-DE-MER smoke-house was built.

This is an atom: 
While the owner a swarthy Arabian, was out on the reef miles away,
a phenomenally high tide occurred.

This is an atom: 
His wife--a comely girl of British
    descent--was alone on the
  shoal.
    [Illustration]

This is an atom: 
In swift devouring ecstacy
    Each toil in turn was done;
  I had done lying on the lawn
    Three minutes after one.

This is an atom: 
For me, as Mr. Wordsworth says,
    The duties shine like stars;
  I formed my uncle's character,
    Decreasing his cigars.

This is an atom: 
But could my kind engross me? No!
    Stern Art--what sons escape her?
  Soon I was drawing Gladstone's nose
    On scraps of blotting paper.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
Then on--to play one-fingered tunes
    Upon my aunt's piano.
  In short, I have a headlong soul,
    I much resemble Hanno.

This is an atom: 
(Forgive the entrance of the not
    Too cogent Carthaginian.
  It may have been to make a rhyme;
    I lean to that opinion).

This is an atom: 
[Illustration]

This is an atom: 
Then my great work of book research
    Till dusk I took in hand--
  The forming of a final, sound
    Opinion on _The Strand_.

This is an atom: 
But when I quenched the midnight oil,
    And closed _The Referee_,
  Whose thirty volumes folio
    I take to bed with me,

This is an atom: 
I had a rather funny dream,
    Intense, that is, and mystic;
  I dreamed that, with one leap and yell,
    The world became artistic.

This is an atom: 
The Shopmen, when their souls were still,
    Declined to open shops--

This is an atom: 
[Illustration]

This is an atom: 
And Cooks recorded frames of mind
    In sad and subtle chops.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration]

This is an atom: 
The stars were weary of routine:
    The trees in the plantation
  Were growing every fruit at once,
    In search of a sensation.

This is an atom: 
The moon went for a moonlight stroll,
    And tried to be a bard,
  And gazed enraptured at itself:
    I left it trying hard.

This is an atom: 
The sea had nothing but a mood
    Of 'vague ironic gloom,'
  With which t'explain its presence in
    My upstairs drawing-room.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration]

This is an atom: 
The sun had read a little book
    That struck him with a notion:
  He drowned himself and all his fires
    Deep in the hissing ocean.

This is an atom: 
Then all was dark, lawless, and lost:
    I heard great devilish wings:
  I knew that Art had won, and snapt
    The Covenant of Things.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration]

This is an atom: 
I cried aloud, and I awoke,
    New labours in my head.
  I set my teeth, and manfully
    Began to lie in bed.

This is an atom: 
Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing,
    So I my life conduct.
  Each morning see some task begun,
    Each evening see it chucked.

This is an atom: 
But still, in sudden moods of dusk,
    I hear those great weird wings,
  Feel vaguely thankful to the vast
    Stupidity of things.

This is an atom: 
*       *       *       *       *

This is an atom: 
ENVOY.

This is an atom: 
Clear was the night: the moon was young:
    The larkspurs in the plots
  Mingled their orange with the gold
    Of the forget-me-nots.

This is an atom: 
The poppies seemed a silver mist:
    So darkly fell the gloom.
  _On the contrary,_ The Philosopher says
    (Ethic. vii, 12, 13; x, 4) that "pleasure is a connatural and
uninterrupted operation."

This is an atom: 
_I answer that,_ As stated above (Q.
    31, A. 1), two things are requisite
  for pleasure: namely, the attainment
    of the suitable good, and knowledge of this attainment.

This is an atom: 
Now each of these consists in
    a kind of operation:
  because actual knowledge
    is an operation; and the attainment of the suitable good is by
means of an operation.

This is an atom: 
Moreover, the proper operation itself
    is a suitable good.
  
    "I feel the will to roam, to learn
    By test, experience, _nous_,
  That fire is hot and ocean deep,
    And wolves carnivorous.

This is an atom: 
"My brain demands complexity."
    The lisping cherub cried.
  I looked at him, and only said,
    "Go on. The world is wide."

This is an atom: 
A tear rolled down his pinafore,
    "Yet from my life must pass
  The simple love of sun and moon,
    The old games in the grass;

This is an atom: 
"Now that my back is to my home
    Could these again be found?"
  I looked on him, and only said,
    "Go on. The world is round."

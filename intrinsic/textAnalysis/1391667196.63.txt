This is an atom: 
ï»¿'Disposed of!' said the colonel. 'Yes! I have done with him. I want no more of him.'

This is an atom: 
'Then, papa,' said Esther, sinking down on her knees beside her father, and affectionately
laying one hand on his knee, 'don't you see this makes things easy for us? I have a proposition.
Will you listen to it?'

This is an atom: 
'A proposition! Say on.'

This is an atom: 
'It is evident that we must take some step to bring our receipts and expenses into harmony.
Your going without fruit and fish will not do it, papa; and I do not like that way of saving,
besides. I had rather make one large change--cut off one or two large things--than a multitude
of small ones. It is easier, and pleasanter. Now, so long as we live in this house we are obliged
to keep a horse; and so long as we have a horse we must have Christopher, or some other man;
and so long as we keep a horse and a man we _must_ make this large outlay, that we cannot afford.
Papa, I propose we move into the city.'

This is an atom: 
'Move! Where?' asked the colonel, with a very unedified expression.

This is an atom: 
'We could find a house in the city somewhere, papa, from which I could walk to Miss Fairbairn's.
That could not be difficult.'

This is an atom: 
'Who is to find the house?'

This is an atom: 
'Could not you, papa? Buonaparte would take you all over; the driving would not do you any harm.'

This is an atom: 
'I have no idea where to begin,' said the colonel, rubbing his head in uneasy perplexity.

This is an atom: 
'I will find out that, papa. I will speak to Miss Fairbairn; she is a great woman of business.
She will tell me.'

This is an atom: 
The colonel still rubbed his head thoughtfully. Esther kept her position, in readiness for
some new objection. The next words, however, surprised her.

This is an atom: 
'I have sometimes thought,'--the colonel's fingers were all the while going through and through
his hair; the action indicating, as such actions do, the mental movement and condition, 'I
have sometimes thought lately that perhaps I was doing you a wrong in keeping you here.'

This is an atom: 
'_Here_, papa?--in New York?'

This is an atom: 
'No. In America.'

This is an atom: 
'In America! Why, sir?'

This is an atom: 
'Your family, my family, are all on the other side. You would have friends if you were there,--you
would have opportunities,--you would not be alone. And in case I am called away, you would
be in good hands. I do not know that I have the right to keep you here.'

This is an atom: 
'Papa, I like to be where you like to be. Do not think of that. Why did we come away from England
in the first place?'

This is an atom: 
The colonel was silent, with a gloomy brow.

This is an atom: 
'It was nothing better than a family quarrel,' he said.

This is an atom: 
'About what? Do you mind telling me, papa?'

This is an atom: 
'No, child; you ought to know. It was a quarrel on the subject of religion.'

This is an atom: 
'How, sir?'

This is an atom: 
'Our family have been Independents from all time. But my father married a second wife, belonging
to the Church of England. She won him over to her way of thinking. I was the only child of
the first marriage; and when I came home from India I found a houseful of younger brothers
and sisters, all belonging, of course, to the Establishment, and my father with them. I was
a kind of outlaw. The advancement of the family was thought to depend very much on the stand
I would take, as after my father's death I would be the head of the family. At least my stepmother
made that a handle for her schemes; and she drove them so successfully that at last my father
declared he would disinherit me if I refused to join him.'

This is an atom: 
'In being a Church of England man?'

This is an atom: 
'Yes.'

This is an atom: 
'But, papa, that was very unjust!'

This is an atom: 
'So I thought. But the injustice was done.'

This is an atom: 
'And you disinherited?'

This is an atom: 
'Yes.'

This is an atom: 
'Oh, papa! Just because you followed your own conscience!'

This is an atom: 
'Just because I held to the traditions of the family. We had _always_ been Independents--fought
with Cromwell and suffered under the Stuarts. I was not going to turn my back on a glorious
record like that for any possible advantages of place and favour.'

This is an atom: 
'What advantages, papa? I do not understand. You spoke of that before.'

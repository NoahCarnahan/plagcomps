Drop, drop, slow tears!
   And bathe those beauteous feet,
   Which brought from heaven
   The news and Prince of peace.
   Cease not, wet eyes,
   For mercy to entreat:
   To cry for vengeance
   Sin doth never cease.
   In your deep floods
   Drown all my faults and fears;
   Nor let His eye
   See sin, but through my tears.

CHAPTER I

This is an atom: 
The Dressmaker's Apprentice at Work

This is an atom: 
There is an assize-town in one of the eastern counties which was much distinguished by the
Tudor sovereigns, and, in consequence of their favour and protection, attained a degree of
importance that surprises the modern traveller.

This is an atom: 
Faint and more faint in sad recessional Down the dim corridors of Time outworn, A chorus
ebbed from that forsaken past, A hymn of glories fled beyond recall With the lost heights and
splendor of life's morn.

This is an atom: 
Sonnet IV
Up at his attic sill the South wind came And days of sun and storm but never peace. Along the
town's tumultuous arteries He heard the heart-throbs of a sentient frame: Each night the whistles
in the bay, the same Whirl of incessant wheels and clanging cars: For smoke that half obscured, the
circling stars Burnt like his youth with but a sickly flame. Up to his attic came the city cries
-- The throes with which her iron sinews heave -- And yet forever behind prison doors Welled in
his heart and trembled in his eyes The light that hangs on desert hills at eve And tints the
sea on solitary shores. . . .

This is an atom: 
Sonnet V
A tide of beauty with returning May Floods the fair city; from warm pavements fume Odors endeared; down
avenues in bloom The chestnut-trees with phallic spires are gay. Over the terrace flows the
thronged cafe; The boulevards are streams of hurrying sound; And through the streets, like
veins when they abound, The lust for pleasure throbs itself away. Here let me live, here let
me still pursue Phantoms of bliss that beckon and recede, -- Thy strange allurements, City that I
love, Maze of romance, where I have followed too The dream Youth
treasures of its dearest need And stars beyond thy towers bring
tidings of.

This is an atom: 
Sonnet VI
Give me the treble of thy horns and hoofs, The ponderous undertones
of 'bus and tram, A garret and a glimpse across the roofs Of clouds
blown eastward over Notre Dame, The glad-eyed streets and radiant
gatherings Where I drank deep the bliss of being young, The strife
and sweet potential flux of things I sought Youth's dream of happiness
among! It walks here aureoled with the city-light, Forever through
the myriad-featured mass Flaunting not far its fugitive embrace,
-- Heard sometimes in a song across the night, Caught in a perfume
from the crowds that pass, And when love yields to love seen face
to face.The daily life into which people are born, and into which they are absorbed before they are
well aware, forms chains which only one in a hundred has moral strength enough to despise,
and to break when the right time comes--when an inward necessity for independent individual
action arises, which is superior to all outward conventionalities. Therefore it is well to
know what were the chains of daily domestic habit which were the natural leading-strings of
our forefathers before they learnt to go alone.

This is an atom: 
The picturesqueness of those ancient streets has departed now. The Astleys, the Dunstans, the
Waverhams--names of power in that district--go up duly to London in the season, and have sold
their residences in the county-town fifty years ago, or more. And when the county-town lost
its attraction for the Astleys, the Dunstans, the Waverhams, how could it be supposed that
the Domvilles, the Bextons, and the Wildes would continue to go and winter there in their second-rate
houses, and with their increased expenditure? So the grand old houses stood empty awhile; and
then speculators ventured to purchase, and to turn the deserted mansions into many smaller
dwellings, fitted for professional men, or even (bend your ear lower, lest the shade of Marmaduke,
first Baron Waverham, hear) into shops!

This is an atom: 
Even that was not so very bad, compared with the next innovation on the old glories. The shopkeepers
found out that the once fashionable street was dark, and that the dingy light did not show
off their goods to advantage; the surgeon could not see to draw his patient's teeth; the lawyer
had to ring for candles an hour earlier than he was accustomed to do when living in a more
plebeian street. In short, by mutual consent, the whole front of one side of the street was
pulled down, and rebuilt in the flat, mean, unrelieved style of George the Third. The body
of the houses was too solidly grand to submit to alteration; so people were occasionally surprised,
after passing through a commonplace-looking shop, to find themselves at the foot of a grand
carved oaken staircase, lighted by a window of stained glass, storied all over with armorial
bearings.

This is an atom: 
Up such a stair--past such a window (through which the moonlight fell on her with a glory of
many colours)--Ruth Hilton passed wearily one January night, now many years ago. I call it
night; but, strictly speaking, it was morning. Two o'clock in the morning chimed forth the
old bells of St Saviour's. And yet more than a dozen girls still sat in the room into which
Ruth entered, stitching away as if for very life, not daring to gape, or show any outward manifestation
of sleepiness. They only sighed a little when Ruth told Mrs Mason the hour of the night, as
the result of her errand; for they knew that, stay up as late as they might, the work-hours
of the next day must begin at eight, and their young limbs were very weary.

This is an atom: 
Mrs Mason worked away as hard as any of them; but she was older and tougher; and, besides,
the gains were hers. But even she perceived that some rest was needed. "Young ladies! there
will be an interval allowed of half an hour. Ring the bell, Miss Sutton. Martha shall bring
you up some bread and cheese and beer. You will be so good as to eat it standing--away from
the dresses--and to have your hands washed ready for work when I return. In half an hour,"
said she once more, very distinctly; and then she left the room.

This is an atom: 
It was curious to watch the young girls as they instantaneously availed themselves of Mrs Mason's
absence. One fat, particularly heavy-looking damsel laid her head on her folded arms and was
asleep in a moment; refusing to be wakened for her share in the frugal supper, but springing
up with a frightened look at the sound of Mrs Mason's returning footstep, even while it was
still far off on the echoing stairs. Two or three others huddled over the scanty fireplace,
which, with every possible economy of space, and no attempt whatever at anything of grace or
ornament, was inserted in the slight, flat-looking wall, that had been run up by the present
owner of the property to portion off this division of the grand old drawing-room of the mansion.
Some employed the time in eating their bread and cheese, with as measured and incessant a motion
of the jaws (and almost as stupidly placid an expression of countenance), as you may see in
cows ruminating in the first meadow you happen to pass.

This is an atom: 
Some held up admiringly the beautiful ball-dress in progress, while others examined the effect,
backing from the object to be criticised in the true artistic manner. Others stretched themselves
into all sorts of postures to relieve the weary muscles; one or two gave vent to all the yawns,
coughs, and sneezes that had been pent up so long in the presence of Mrs Mason. But Ruth Hilton
sprang to the large old window, and pressed against it as a bird presses against the bars of
its cage. She put back the blind, and gazed into the quiet moonlight night. It was doubly light--almost
as much so as day--for everything was covered with the deep snow which had been falling silently
ever since the evening before. The window was in a square recess; the old strange little panes
of glass had been replaced by those which gave more light. A little distance off, the feathery
branches of a larch waved softly to and fro in the scarcely perceptible night-breeze. Poor
old larch! the time had been when it had stood in a pleasant lawn, with the tender grass creeping
caressingly up to its very trunk; but now the lawn was divided into yards and squalid back
premises, and the larch was pent up and girded about with flag-stones. The snow lay thick on
its boughs, and now and then fell noiselessly down. The old stables had been added to, and
altered into a dismal street of mean-looking houses, back to back with the ancient mansions.
And over all these changes from grandeur to squalor, bent down the purple heavens with their
unchanging splendour!

This is an atom: 
Ruth pressed her hot forehead against the cold glass, and strained her aching eyes in gazing
out on the lovely sky of a winter's night. The impulse was strong upon her to snatch up a shawl,
and wrapping it round her head, to sally forth and enjoy the glory; and time was when that
impulse would have been instantly followed; but now, Ruth's eyes filled with tears, and she
stood quite still, dreaming of the days that were gone. Some one touched her shoulder while
her thoughts were far away, remembering past January nights, which had resembled this, and
were yet so different.

This is an atom: 
"Ruth, love," whispered a girl who had unwillingly distinguished herself by a long hard fit
of coughing, "come and have some supper. You don't know yet how it helps one through the night."

This is an atom: 
"One run--one blow of the fresh air would do me more good," said Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"Not such a night as this," replied the other, shivering at the very thought.

This is an atom: 
"And why not such a night as this, Jenny?" answered Ruth. "Oh! at home I have many a time run
up the lane all the way to the mill, just to see the icicles hang on the great wheel; and when
I was once out, I could hardly find in my heart to come in, even to mother, sitting by the
fire;--even to mother," she added, in a low, melancholy tone, which had something of inexpressible
sadness in it. "Why, Jenny!" said she, rousing herself, but not before her eyes were swimming
with tears, "own, now, that you never saw those dismal, hateful, tumble-down old houses there
look half so--what shall I call them? almost beautiful--as they do now, with that soft, pure,
exquisite covering; and if they are so improved, think of what trees, and grass, and ivy must
be on such a night as this."

This is an atom: 
Jenny could not be persuaded into admiring the winter's night, which to her came only as a
cold and dismal time, when her cough was more troublesome, and the pain in her side worse than
usual. But she put her arm round Ruth's neck, and stood by her, glad that the orphan apprentice,
who was not yet inured to the hardship of a dressmaker's workroom, should find so much to give
her pleasure in such a common occurrence as a frosty night.

This is an atom: 
They remained deep in separate trains of thought till Mrs Mason's step was heard, when each
returned, supperless but refreshed, to her seat.

This is an atom: 
Ruth's place was the coldest and the darkest in the room, although she liked it the best; she
had instinctively chosen it for the sake of the wall opposite to her, on which was a remnant
of the beauty of the old drawing-room, which must once have been magnificent, to judge from
the faded specimen left. It was divided into panels of pale sea-green, picked out with white
and gold; and on these panels were painted--were thrown with the careless, triumphant hand
of a master--the most lovely wreaths of flowers, profuse and luxuriant beyond description,
and so real-looking, that you could almost fancy you smelt their fragrance, and heard the south
wind go softly rustling in and out among the crimson roses--the branches of purple and white
lilac--the floating golden-tressed laburnum boughs. Besides these, there were stately white
lilies, sacred to the Virgin--hollyhocks, fraxinella, monk's-hood, pansies, primroses; every
flower which blooms profusely in charming old-fashioned country gardens was there, depicted
among its graceful foliage, but not in the wild disorder in which I have enumerated them. At
the bottom of the panel lay a holly-branch, whose stiff straightness was ornamented by a twining
drapery of English ivy and mistletoe and winter aconite; while down either side hung pendant
garlands of spring and autumn flowers; and, crowning all, came gorgeous summer with the sweet
musk-roses, and the rich-coloured flowers of June and July.

This is an atom: 
Surely Monnoyer, or whoever the dead and gone artist might be, would have been gratified to
know the pleasure his handiwork, even in its wane, had power to give to the heavy heart of
a young girl; for they conjured up visions of other sister-flowers that grew, and blossomed,
and withered away in her early home.

This is an atom: 
Mrs Mason was particularly desirous that her workwomen should exert themselves to-night, for,
on the next, the annual hunt-ball was to take place. It was the one gaiety of the town since
the assize-balls had been discontinued. Many were the dresses she had promised should be sent
home "without fail" the next morning; she had not let one slip through her fingers, for fear,
if it did, it might fall into the hands of the rival dressmaker, who had just established herself
in the very same street.

This is an atom: 
She determined to administer a gentle stimulant to the flagging spirits, and with a little
preliminary cough to attract attention, she began:

This is an atom: 
"I may as well inform you, young ladies, that I have been requested this year, as on previous
occasions, to allow some of my young people to attend in the ante-chamber of the assembly-room
with sandal ribbon, pins, and such little matters, and to be ready to repair any accidental
injury to the ladies' dresses. I shall send four--of the most diligent." She laid a marked
emphasis on the last words, but without much effect; they were too sleepy to care for any of
the pomps and vanities, or, indeed, for any of the comforts of this world, excepting one sole
thing--their beds.

This is an atom: 
Mrs Mason was a very worthy woman, but, like many other worthy women, she had her foibles;
and one (very natural to her calling) was to pay an extreme regard to appearances. Accordingly,
she had already selected in her own mind the four girls who were most likely to do credit to
the "establishment;" and these were secretly determined upon, although it was very well to
promise the reward to the most diligent. She was really not aware of the falseness of this
conduct; being an adept in that species of sophistry with which people persuade themselves
that what they wish to do is right.

This is an atom: 
At last there was no resisting the evidence of weariness. They were told to go to bed; but
even that welcome command was languidly obeyed. Slowly they folded up their work, heavily they
moved about, until at length all was put away, and they trooped up the wide, dark staircase.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! how shall I get through five years of these terrible nights! in that close room! and in
that oppressive stillness! which lets every sound of the thread be heard as it goes eternally
backwards and forwards," sobbed out Ruth, as she threw herself on her bed, without even undressing
herself.

This is an atom: 
"Nay, Ruth, you know it won't be always as it has been to-night. We often get to bed by ten
o'clock; and by-and-by you won't mind the closeness of the room. You're worn out to-night,
or you would not have minded the sound of the needle; I never hear it. Come, let me unfasten
you," said Jenny.

This is an atom: 
"What is the use of undressing? We must be up again and at work in three hours."

This is an atom: 
"And in those three hours you may get a great deal of rest, if you will but undress yourself
and fairly go to bed. Come, love."

This is an atom: 
Jenny's advice was not resisted; but before Ruth went to sleep, she said:

This is an atom: 
"Oh! I wish I was not so cross and impatient. I don't think I used to be."

This is an atom: 
"No, I am sure not. Most new girls get impatient at first; but it goes off, and they don't
care much for anything after awhile. Poor child! she's asleep already," said Jenny to herself.

This is an atom: 
She could not sleep or rest. The tightness at her side was worse than usual. She almost thought
she ought to mention it in her letters home; but then she remembered the premium her father
had struggled hard to pay, and the large family, younger than herself, that had to be cared
for, and she determined to bear on, and trust that when the warm weather came both the pain
and the cough would go away. She would be prudent about herself.

This is an atom: 
What was the matter with Ruth? She was crying in her sleep as if her heart would break. Such
agitated slumber could be no rest; so Jenny wakened her.

This is an atom: 
"Ruth! Ruth!"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Jenny!" said Ruth, sitting up in bed, and pushing back the masses of hair that were heating
her forehead, "I thought I saw mamma by the side of the bed, coming, as she used to do, to
see if I were asleep and comfortable; and when I tried to take hold of her, she went away and
left me alone--I don't know where; so strange!"

This is an atom: 
"It was only a dream; you know you'd been talking about her to me, and you're feverish with
sitting up late. Go to sleep again, and I'll watch, and waken you if you seem uneasy."

This is an atom: 
"But you'll be so tired. Oh, dear! dear!" Ruth was asleep again, even while she sighed.

This is an atom: 
Morning came, and though their rest had been short, the girls arose refreshed.

This is an atom: 
"Miss Sutton, Miss Jennings, Miss Booth, and Miss Hilton, you will see that you are ready to
accompany me to the shire-hall by eight o'clock."

This is an atom: 
One or two of the girls looked astonished, but the majority, having anticipated the selection,
and knowing from experience the unexpressed rule by which it was made, received it with the
sullen indifference which had become their feeling with regard to most events--a deadened sense
of life, consequent upon their unnatural mode of existence, their sedentary days, and their
frequent nights of late watching.

This is an atom: 
But to Ruth it was inexplicable. She had yawned, and loitered, and looked off at the beautiful
panel, and lost herself in thoughts of home, until she fully expected the reprimand which at
any other time she would have been sure to receive, and now, to her surprise, she was singled
out as one of the most diligent!

This is an atom: 
Much as she longed for the delight of seeing the noble shire-hall--the boast of the county--and
of catching glimpses of the dancers, and hearing the band; much as she longed for some variety
to the dull, monotonous life she was leading, she could not feel happy to accept a privilege,
granted, as she believed, in ignorance of the real state of the case; so she startled her companions
by rising abruptly and going up to Mrs Mason, who was finishing a dress which ought to have
been sent home two hours before:

This is an atom: 
"If you please, Mrs Mason, I was not one of the most diligent; I am afraid--I believe--I was
not diligent at all. I was very tired; and I could not help thinking, and when I think, I can't
attend to my work." She stopped, believing she had sufficiently explained her meaning; but
Mrs Mason would not understand, and did not wish for any further elucidation.

This is an atom: 
"Well, my dear, you must learn to think and work too; or, if you can't do both, you must leave
off thinking. Your guardian, you know, expects you to make great progress in your business,
and I am sure you won't disappoint him."

This is an atom: 
But that was not to the point. Ruth stood still an instant, although Mrs Mason resumed her
employment in a manner which any one but a "new girl" would have known to be intelligible enough,
that she did not wish for any more conversation just then.

This is an atom: 
"But as I was not diligent I ought not to go, ma'am. Miss Wood was far more industrious than
I, and many of the others."

This is an atom: 
"Tiresome girl!" muttered Mrs Mason; "I've half a mind to keep her at home for plaguing me
so." But, looking up, she was struck afresh with the remarkable beauty which Ruth possessed;
such a credit to the house, with her waving outline of figure, her striking face, with dark
eyebrows and dark lashes, combined with auburn hair and a fair complexion. No! diligent or
idle, Ruth Hilton must appear to-night.

This is an atom: 
"Miss Hilton," said Mrs Mason, with stiff dignity, "I am not accustomed (as these young ladies
can tell you) to have my decisions questioned. What I say, I mean; and I have my reasons. So
sit down, if you please, and take care and be ready by eight. Not a word more," as she fancied
she saw Ruth again about to speak.

This is an atom: 
"Jenny! you ought to have gone, not me," said Ruth, in no low voice to Miss Wood, as she sat
down by her.

This is an atom: 
"Hush! Ruth. I could not go if I might, because of my cough. I would rather give it up to you
than any one, if it were mine to give. And suppose it is, and take the pleasure as my present,
and tell me every bit about it when you come home to-night."

This is an atom: 
"Well! I shall take it in that way, and not as if I'd earned it, which I haven't. So thank
you. You can't think how I shall enjoy it now. I did work diligently for five minutes last
night, after I heard of it, I wanted to go so much. But I could not keep it up. Oh, dear! and
I shall really hear a band! and see the inside of that beautiful shire-hall!"

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER II

This is an atom: 
Ruth Goes to the Shire-Hall

This is an atom: 
In due time that evening, Mrs Mason collected "her young ladies" for an inspection of their
appearance before proceeding to the shire-hall. Her eager, important, hurried manner of summoning
them was not unlike that of a hen clucking her chickens together; and to judge from the close
investigation they had to undergo, it might have been thought that their part in the evening's
performance was to be far more important than that of temporary ladies'-maids.

This is an atom: 
"Is that your best frock, Miss Hilton?" asked Mrs Mason, in a half-dissatisfied tone, turning
Ruth about; for it was only her Sunday black silk, and was somewhat worn and shabby.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, ma'am," answered Ruth, quietly.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! indeed. Then it will do" (still the half-satisfied tone). "Dress, young ladies, you know,
is a very secondary consideration. Conduct is everything. Still, Miss Hilton, I think you should
write and ask your guardian to send you money for another gown. I am sorry I did not think
of it before."

This is an atom: 
"I do not think he would send any if I wrote," answered Ruth, in a low voice. "He was angry
when I wanted a shawl, when the cold weather set in."

This is an atom: 
Mrs Mason gave her a little push of dismissal, and Ruth fell into the ranks by her friend,
Miss Wood.

This is an atom: 
"Never mind, Ruthie; you're prettier than any of them," said a merry, good-natured girl, whose
plainness excluded her from any of the envy of rivalry.

This is an atom: 
"Yes! I know I am pretty," said Ruth, sadly, "but I am sorry I have no better gown, for this
is very shabby. I am ashamed of it myself, and I can see Mrs Mason is twice as much ashamed.
I wish I need not go. I did not know we should have to think about our own dress at all, or
I should not have wished to go."

This is an atom: 
"Never mind, Ruth," said Jenny, "you've been looked at now, and Mrs Mason will soon be too
busy to think about you and your gown."

This is an atom: 
"Did you hear Ruth Hilton say she knew she was pretty?" whispered one girl to another, so loudly
that Ruth caught the words.

This is an atom: 
"I could not help knowing," answered she, simply, "for many people have told me so."

This is an atom: 
At length these preliminaries were over, and they were walking briskly through the frosty air;
the free motion was so inspiriting that Ruth almost danced along, and quite forgot all about
shabby gowns and grumbling guardians. The shire-hall was even more striking than she had expected.
The sides of the staircase were painted with figures that showed ghostly in the dim light,
for only their faces looked out of the dark, dingy canvas, with a strange fixed stare of expression.

This is an atom: 
The young milliners had to arrange their wares on tables in the ante-room, and make all ready
before they could venture to peep into the ball-room, where the musicians were already tuning
their instruments, and where one or two char-women (strange contrast! with their dirty, loose
attire, and their incessant chatter, to the grand echoes of the vaulted room) were completing
the dusting of benches and chairs.

This is an atom: 
They quitted the place as Ruth and her companions entered. They had talked lightly and merrily
in the ante-room, but now their voices were hushed, awed by the old magnificence of the vast
apartment. It was so large, that objects showed dim at the further end, as through a mist.
Full-length figures of county worthies hung around, in all varieties of costume, from the days
of Holbein to the present time. The lofty roof was indistinct, for the lamps were not fully
lighted yet; while through the richly-painted Gothic window at one end the moonbeams fell,
many-tinted, on the floor, and mocked with their vividness the struggles of the artificial
light to illuminate its little sphere.

This is an atom: 
High above sounded the musicians, fitfully trying some strain of which they were not certain.
Then they stopped playing and talked, and their voices sounded goblin-like in their dark recess,
where candles were carried about in an uncertain wavering manner, reminding Ruth of the flickering
zigzag motion of the will-o'-the-wisp.

This is an atom: 
Suddenly the room sprang into the full blaze of light, and Ruth felt less impressed with its
appearance, and more willing to obey Mrs Mason's sharp summons to her wandering flock, than
she had been when it was dim and mysterious. They had presently enough to do in rendering offices
of assistance to the ladies who thronged in, and whose voices drowned all the muffled sound
of the band Ruth had longed so much to hear. Still, if one pleasure was less, another was greater
than she had anticipated.

This is an atom: 
"On condition" of such a number of little observances that Ruth thought Mrs Mason would never
have ended enumerating them, they were allowed during the dances to stand at a side-door and
watch. And what a beautiful sight it was! Floating away to that bounding music--now far away,
like garlands of fairies, now near, and showing as lovely women, with every ornament of graceful
dress--the elite of the county danced on, little caring whose eyes gazed and were dazzled.
Outside all was cold, and colourless, and uniform, one coating of snow over all. But inside
it was warm, and glowing, and vivid; flowers scented the air, and wreathed the head, and rested
on the bosom, as if it were midsummer. Bright colours flashed on the eye and were gone, and
succeeded by others as lovely in the rapid movement of the dance. Smiles dimpled every face,
and low tones of happiness murmured indistinctly through the room in every pause of the music.

This is an atom: 
Ruth did not care to separate the figures that formed a joyous and brilliant whole; it was
enough to gaze, and dream of the happy smoothness of the lives in which such music, and such
profusion of flowers, of jewels, elegance of every description, and beauty of all shapes and
hues, were everyday things. She did not want to know who the people were; although to hear
a catalogue of names seemed to be the great delight of most of her companions.

This is an atom: 
In fact, the enumeration rather disturbed her; and to avoid the shock of too rapid a descent
into the commonplace world of Miss Smiths and Mr Thomsons, she returned to her post in the
ante-room. There she stood thinking, or dreaming. She was startled back to actual life by a
voice close to her. One of the dancing young ladies had met with a misfortune. Her dress, of
some gossamer material, had been looped up by nosegays of flowers, and one of these had fallen
off in the dance, leaving her gown to trail. To repair this, she had begged her partner to
bring her to the room where the assistants should have been. None were there but Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"Shall I leave you?" asked the gentleman. "Is my absence necessary?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, no!" replied the lady. "A few stitches will set all to rights. Besides, I dare not enter
that room by myself." So far she spoke sweetly and prettily. But now she addressed Ruth. "Make
haste. Don't keep me an hour." And her voice became cold and authoritative.

This is an atom: 
She was very pretty, with long dark ringlets and sparkling black eyes. These had struck Ruth
in the hasty glance she had taken, before she knelt down to her task. She also saw that the
gentleman was young and elegant.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, that lovely galop! How I long to dance to it! Will it never be done? What a frightful
time you are taking; and I'm dying to return in time for this galop!"

This is an atom: 
By way of showing a pretty, childlike impatience, she began to beat time with her feet to the
spirited air the band was playing. Ruth could not darn the rent in her dress with this continual
motion, and she looked up to remonstrate. As she threw her head back for this purpose, she
caught the eye of the gentleman who was standing by; it was so expressive of amusement at the
airs and graces of his pretty partner, that Ruth was infected by the feeling, and had to bend
her face down to conceal the smile that mantled there. But not before he had seen it, and not
before his attention had been thereby drawn to consider the kneeling figure, that, habited
in black up to the throat, with the noble head bent down to the occupation in which she was
engaged, formed such a contrast to the flippant, bright, artificial girl who sat to be served
with an air as haughty as a queen on her throne.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Mr Bellingham! I'm ashamed to detain you so long. I had no idea any one could have spent
so much time over a little tear. No wonder Mrs Mason charges so much for dress-making, if her
work-women are so slow."

This is an atom: 
It was meant to be witty, but Mr Bellingham looked grave. He saw the scarlet colour of annoyance
flush to that beautiful cheek which was partially presented to him. He took a candle from the
table, and held it so that Ruth had more light. She did not look up to thank him, for she felt
ashamed that he should have seen the smile which she had caught from him.

This is an atom: 
"I am sorry I have been so long, ma'am," said she, gently, as she finished her work. "I was
afraid it might tear out again if I did not do it carefully." She rose.

This is an atom: 
"I would rather have had it torn than have missed that charming galop," said the young lady,
shaking out her dress as a bird shakes its plumage. "Shall we go, Mr Bellingham?" looking up
at him.

This is an atom: 
He was surprised that she gave no word or sign of thanks to the assistant. He took up a camellia
that some one had left on the table.

This is an atom: 
"Allow me, Miss Duncombe, to give this in your name to this young lady, as thanks for her dexterous
help."

This is an atom: 
"Oh--of course," said she.

This is an atom: 
Ruth received the flower silently, but with a grave, modest motion of her head. They had gone,
and she was once more alone. Presently, her companions returned.

This is an atom: 
"What was the matter with Miss Duncombe? Did she come here?" asked they.

This is an atom: 
"Only her lace dress was torn, and I mended it," answered Ruth, quietly.

This is an atom: 
"Did Mr Bellingham come with her? They say he's going to be married to her; did he come, Ruth?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said Ruth, and relapsed into silence.

This is an atom: 
Mr Bellingham danced on gaily and merrily through the night, and flirted with Miss Duncombe,
as he thought good. But he looked often to the side-door where the milliner's apprentices stood;
and once he recognised the tall, slight figure, and the rich auburn hair of the girl in black;
and then his eye sought for the camellia. It was there, snowy white in her bosom. And he danced
on more gaily than ever.

This is an atom: 
The cold grey dawn was drearily lighting up the streets when Mrs Mason and her company returned
home. The lamps were extinguished, yet the shutters of the shops and dwelling-houses were not
opened. All sounds had an echo unheard by day. One or two houseless beggars sat on doorsteps,
and, shivering, slept, with heads bowed on their knees, or resting against the cold hard support
afforded by the wall.

This is an atom: 
His patch of land he plants with corn, sweet potatoes and other vegetables. Bananas, plantains
and other fruits grow wild and may be had for the picking.

This is an atom: 
His vegetables, fruit and poultry he takes to the market and sells, but only when compelled to
do so by necessity.

This is an atom: 
This money is spent for clothing or other articles, or perhaps lost in gambling.

This is an atom: 
Only the lightest kind of clothing is necessary; for the coldest days are not so cold as our
mild autumn days.

This is an atom: 
The dress of the farmer consists of a cotton jacket, white shirt
and check pantaloons.

This is an atom: 
His head is protected from the hot rays of the sun by a large
broad-brimmed hat.

This is an atom: 
This is made from the grass which grows around his doorway. No shoes are needed.

This is an atom: 
The dress of his wife is a simple white cotton gown, and his children wear no clothes at all.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: HOME OF A PEASANT FARMER OF THE BETTER CLASS.]
The houses or homes of the peasant farmers are nearly all alike.

This is an atom: 
They are built in a few days, from poles and royal palm bark. They
are thatched with leaves of the palm or with grass.

This is an atom: 
These huts are usually divided into two rooms.

This is an atom: 
There are no chimneys, often no windows, and but one door. A very poor house, you think; but
then it is only intended for a shelter.

This is an atom: 
It shields them from the damp and cool winds of night and the daily
rains of the rainy season.

This is an atom: 
At other times they live outside.

This is an atom: 
There is no stove, and of cooking utensils there are few.

This is an atom: 
The cooking is done for the most part outside the house, when the
weather is dry, on a sheet of iron or in an iron kettle.

This is an atom: 
The food is served in gourd dishes and eaten with gourd spoons.

This is an atom: 
During the rainy season the people live in great discomfort. The cooking must be done inside
the hut at this time.

This is an atom: 
As there is no chimney, the room is soon filled with smoke, which
can only escape through the openings under the eaves.

This is an atom: 
Would you like to see the furniture of one of these poor cabins? It consists of a few calabash
shells used for eating vessels; some rude earthen pots; a tin cup, perhaps; two or three
hammocks made of the bark of the palm tree, and a machete.

This is an atom: 
Bunches of dried herbs and gourds dangle on the walls, but there are no pictures, curtains,
or ornaments of any kind.

This is an atom: 
At night the people sleep on the floor, or in hammocks. They spend much of the day also in
swinging to and fro in their hammocks, smoking, and playing on their guitars and other
native musical instruments.

This is an atom: 
By the door the family dog and the naked babies tumble in the dirt. Perhaps there is a pig and
some poultry; but there is sure to be a game-cock or two.

This is an atom: 
Near the house is the garden.

This is an atom: 
In this are raised sweet potatoes, beans, squashes, muskmelons, peppers, gourds, calabashes,
bananas and plantains.

This is an atom: 
The farmers we see at work have their oxen harnessed to rude plows
by the horns.

This is an atom: 
The ground is so rich it is not necessary to plow it very deep.

This is an atom: 
An acre of good land here will produce more vegetables and fruit than in most other countries.

This is an atom: 
Riding through the country we see plantations of coffee, sugar cane or tobacco, and also stock
farms. Puerto Rico is fertile from the mountain tops to the sea. It is rich in pasture lands,
shaded with groves of palm trees, and watered by hundreds of
streams.

This is an atom: 
Here and there herds of horses and cattle and flocks of sheep graze on the plains. When we
approach the flocks of sheep, we discover a very curious thing.

This is an atom: 
The wool on these sheep is not at all like the wool on the sheep
raised in our own country.

This is an atom: 
It is more like the hair of the goat.

This is an atom: 
Cattle are highly valued by the people, not only for dairy and food purposes, but as beasts of
burden and draft.

This is an atom: 
Outside of the large plantations, crops are raised on a small scale; and modern implements
and machinery are almost unknown.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: A MOUNTAIN VILLAGE IN PUERTO RICO.]
Most of the land is divided up into very small farms or garden patches, or is taken up by
groves.

This is an atom: 
In the interior of the country are many little villages, shut out from the rest of the
world.
We reach them by the narrow horse-trails that wind in and out among
the mountains.

This is an atom: 
THE LABORER'S HILLSIDE HOME.

This is an atom: 
Perched on the hilltops and sides, shaded by banana trees, are the picturesque little huts of
the laborers. Most of them pay no rent. Land owners give them small patches of ground on the
hillsides, which they themselves do not care to till, in order to have the laborers near or
on the plantations to assist in cultivating or harvesting the sugar cane, tobacco and coffee
crops.

This is an atom: 
Here the peasant laborers build their cabins; and, when there is no work for them on the
plantations, they tend their gardens in a haphazard way. By working a little each day they manage to
make a scant living.

This is an atom: 
Five months of the year they labor for their landlords, receiving about fifty cents a day.

This is an atom: 
The laborer is often paid in plantains. Fifty plantains are a day's pay. On this he feeds his
family, for the plantain is the Puerto Rican peasant's bread.

This is an atom: 
The plantains left are taken to market and sold. One day a week is lost in this way, for the
market is often twenty miles away.

This is an atom: 
Near a stream on the mountain side we see a group of women. Some of them are sitting on stones
by the bank; others are standing in the hot sun in midstream, and
all are washing.

This is an atom: 
It is wash day, and they have brought their clothes here to wash them. They have no tubs,
wash-boards, clothes-pins, or clothes-lines. Sometimes they have no soap. In place of this, they
use the seed or roots of the soapberry tree.

This is an atom: 
The soap-seed tree bears several months in the year. The seed is inclosed in a yellow skin,
and is black, and about the size of a marble.

This is an atom: 
The leaf of a vine, called the soap vine is also used for the purpose of washing clothes.

This is an atom: 
The clothes are first soaked in the stream or pond, and then spread
upon a broad, smooth stone; after which they are pounded with clubs
or stones.

This is an atom: 
When they are clean, they are spread out upon the bushes to dry and bleach.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: COOKING THE EVENING MEAL.]
Then the tired women rest under the trees, and chat, and perhaps smoke until evening. When the
hot sun has gone down in the west, they make their damp and dry clothes up into huge bundles,
lift them to their heads, and plod homeward.

This is an atom: 
Let us follow them to their homes up on the mountain side. Some of the huts are built closely
together. Others are scattered about on lonely ledges. Shall we go inside one of these huts?

This is an atom: 
The woman who has just returned has thrown her burden into a corner.

This is an atom: 
The fire has been carefully smoldered, and this she now blows into
a flame and then proceeds to prepare the evening meal.

This is an atom: 
About the other cottages are women squatting on their heels, gossiping with one another. In the ditch
near by little children paddle about. Their voices are soft and pleasant, and their play merry
and good-natured. We hear no quarreling.

This is an atom: 
Now their mother calls them to bring in some sticks for the fire. When these are added to the
flame, the firelight shines out in the darkness and guides the
father on his homeward way.

This is an atom: 
He has been working on the coffee plantation near, and is now climbing the narrow, winding
path up the hill with his load of plantains. Perhaps the wife will cook some for supper.

This is an atom: 
The children satisfy their hunger, and then creep into their corner
or hammock and are soon fast asleep.

This is an atom: 
Out in the darkness we hear the tinkle of a homemade guitar.

This is an atom: 
Now another, and then another, takes up the Spanish or Indian air.

This is an atom: 
Perhaps the beater of a drum is added to the little band of musicians which has gathered in
an open space near the small village.

This is an atom: 
The natives compose much of their own music, and wild, strange
melody it is.

This is an atom: 
It seems to inspire one with a wish to dance. The Puerto Ricans are very fond of this amusement,
and when they hear the music of the band, they gather around for a frolic.

This is an atom: 
Once a week, at least, they gather for a dance; and this, with their
cock-fighting and gambling, is almost their only form of amusement.

This is an atom: 
Few of these people can write or read. They have no books and can
not afford to buy even a newspaper.

This is an atom: 
The life of the peasant in Puerto Rico, you see, is not an easy or pleasant one; but he does
not suffer from cold or hunger, as do the poor in northern countries.

This is an atom: 
* * * * *

This is an atom: 
GLIMPSES OF OTHER CITIES.

This is an atom: 
We have now a very good idea of San Juan and of rural life in districts near it.

This is an atom: 
So let us travel about the island a bit, for glimpses of other parts
of the country, and of the other important cities.

This is an atom: 
The most comfortable way to do this would be to make the voyage around the island on board the
ship, going ashore for sight-seeing when the ship makes port for freight.

This is an atom: 
But this would give us no opportunity to see the interior of the island; so we make up our
minds to endure poor roads in order to enjoy the mild adventures that fall to our lot (as all
good travelers should do).

This is an atom: 
We decide to celebrate the seventeenth of November, the anniversary of the discovery of the
island, at the place where the ship of Columbus first touched land
over four hundred years ago.

This is an atom: 
We find no Pullman cars on the railroad which leaves San Juan for Aguadilla; but the novelty
of the ride takes the place of the luxuries to which we are accustomed at home.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: SENDING SUGAR ABROAD.]
The train goes leisurely along at the rate of sixteen miles an hour. We are glad that it goes
no faster, for it gives us an opportunity to see the beautiful country through which we are
passing.

This is an atom: 
The line follows the coast most of the way. Upon one side are frequent views of the ocean, and
upon the other a constant panorama of wonderful scenery.

This is an atom: 
ARECIBO.

This is an atom: 
A ride of four or five hours brings us to Arecibo, a town of 7,000 people, on the north coast.

This is an atom: 
It is the headquarters of the sugar industry, and the chief town of one of the most fruitful regions
on the island.

This is an atom: 
The harbor is very poor, being little more than an open roadstead.
Into this harbor empties a small stream called the Arecibo.

This is an atom: 
Goods are transported on this river, to and from the town, in flat-bottomed boats, with the
aid of long poles and by much patient pushing.

This is an atom: 
Along the river are valuable plantations of sugar and coffee, as
also fine pastures.

This is an atom: 
Arecibo boasts one of the most handsome and artistic plazas on the island. These plazas are usually
paved with stone and devoid of vegetation; but this one has a small
park in its center, surrounding a beautiful fountain.

This is an atom: 
The cathedral, which faces the plaza, is larger than usual, and
more modern than most of the church buildings in the West Indies.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: CATHEDRAL AT ARECIBO.]
AGUADILLA.

This is an atom: 
After a night spent in Arecibo we wish to hasten on to Aguadilla,
but the railroad, we find, will not carry us so far.

This is an atom: 
It ends at Camuy, a few miles west of Arecibo.

This is an atom: 
Here we take a carriage for the remainder of the journey.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: DRYING AND HULLING COFFEE.]

This is an atom: 
The old-fashioned coaches are drawn by small ponies, and these brave little animals carry us
up hill and down hill, through deep mud holes, over rocks, into
and out of ruts, at a terrific pace.

This is an atom: 
We wonder that the carriage does not break and spill us out. The driver lashes the poor beasts
until it seems as if his arms must be lame, but our protests have
no effect on him.

This is an atom: 
Aguadilla, a quiet, peaceful little city of 5,000, lies on the
western coast.

This is an atom: 
Here Columbus landed in search of water when he made his second voyage.

This is an atom: 
He found a clear, rippling spring, with the water filled his casks, and continued on his way.

This is an atom: 
On the shore stands a cross marking the spot where his boat's keel touched the sand.

This is an atom: 
The town has beautiful trees, and is surrounded by choice grazing-lands.

This is an atom: 
It is noted for its fish, sugar-cane, sweet oranges, and lemons.

This is an atom: 
The cultivation of sugar-cane, coffee, tobacco and cocoanuts furnishes
the industries of the neighborhood.

This is an atom: 
We find the three establishments for the preparation of coffee for market very interesting
places to visit.

This is an atom: 
MAYAGUEZ.

This is an atom: 
Leaving Aguadilla for Mayaguez, we take the tramway which connects the two towns. It is the
only one on the island, and the people are very proud of it.

This is an atom: 
But oh, what a ridiculous little road!

This is an atom: 
It is a narrow gauge, not more than forty-seven inches wide.

This is an atom: 
The cars are quite diminutive, and do not carry more than ten or twelve people. We can ride the
length of the road, about two miles, for five cents.

This is an atom: 
We see long lines of patient oxen plodding their way to the city, pulling clumsy carts piled
high with oranges.

This is an atom: 
Mayaguez is the market to which the best oranges in Puerto Rico come.

This is an atom: 
Large, sweet, and luscious we find this fruit, the principal food of many of the people.

This is an atom: 
It grows wild by the roadside, in the valleys, everywhere except on the hillsides. Such quantities
of oranges!

This is an atom: 
It seems as if enough of the fruit is grown in Puerto Rico to supply the whole of the United
States. Yet very few oranges are sent away from the island. They can not be shipped profitably
until good roads are built.

This is an atom: 
The city of Mayaguez claims a population of 20,000 people. It has, probably, 12,000 to
15,000.
It is the great western shipping port, is the third largest city, and the prettiest and most
attractive city in Puerto Rico.

This is an atom: 
Mayaguez is very different in appearance and customs from the other cities. We can scarcely
realize that we are on the same island.

This is an atom: 
The streets are macadamized, wide, shaded by trees, and lined with handsome shops and
residences.
The sidewalks are narrow,--only two can walk abreast on them.

This is an atom: 
The town is well provided with public buildings. It has also three hospitals, a home for the destitute,
a public library, good waterworks, is lighted by electricity, and possesses the only street-car
line on the island. The principal plaza is a park of grand old shade trees.
It contains a majestic statue of Columbus.

This is an atom: 
The citizens are, many of them, coffee planters who have estates near the city. Each family of
the better class dwells in a home of its own, instead of living in second stories.

This is an atom: 
The poor people of the town are not so poor, or unclean, or shiftless, as the poorer classes
at the capital.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: A VIEW IN PONCE, PUERTO RICO.]
PONCE.

This is an atom: 
To reach Ponce, the next city we wish to visit, we must use carriages as well as railways.

This is an atom: 
It is on the southern side of the island.

This is an atom: 
Ponce is the largest city in Puerto Rico, having a population of
over thirty-seven thousand people. The main part is built on a plain
about three miles from the seashore.
A fine road connects it with Playa, the port, where are found a
good harbor, large wharves and the more important government
offices.
Ponce has wide, clean streets, handsome buildings, and attractive
homes. Many quaint and picturesque old buildings line its avenues;
but in the newer parts of the town and in the suburbs the buildings
are modern.
It has a military hospital and barracks, two other hospitals, a
home for the old and poor, gas works, and an ice machine. There are
also establishments for hulling coffee, drying coffee, distilling
rum, manufacturing carriages, and grinding sugar. (See illustrations
on pages 54 and 69).
The large central plaza has pretty gardens and a cathedral.
There are three manufactories of chocolate for the use of the people
in the surrounding country.
Sugar, coffee, oranges, pineapples and cocoanuts are brought here
to be shipped to the United States and other countries.
Near the city are white-gypsum quarries; also medicinal baths, to
which many invalids and travelers go.
The only Protestant church in the West Indies is the Episcopal
church here.
On the outskirts of Ponce is an old cemetery, in which many famous
Puerto Ricans of an early day were buried. It is quite different
from our idea of a cemetery. It is one solid mass of masonry built
into the side of a hill. In this are narrow vaults, one above the
other.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: A FUNERAL PROCESSION.]
The openings of these vaults look much like bakers' ovens. The
bottom vaults are used first, and when a body is laid in one of
them it is sealed up and the name of the deceased graven on the
outside. The next member of the family who dies is placed in the
vault above; and so on, each family having a tier of vaults.
As carriages and hearses are rare objects in Ponce, the coffin is
sometimes carried on the shoulders of men. The procession is often
composed of those attracted by curiosity, rather than the friends
and relatives of the deceased.
The people of Ponce are wide-awake, progressive and anxious to
better their condition. They are also more hospitable and friendly
than in other towns.
It was here that the American army under General Miles proceeded
in 1898, after landing at Guanica. The troops received a hearty
welcome from the inhabitants.
The people were glad to be relieved from Spanish rule, and wished
to have their land annexed to the United States.
A proclamation of welcome was issued to the soldiers, feasts were
spread, and the stars and stripes floated from many house tops.
THE MILITARY ROAD.
Now we are ready to return to San Juan, going northward over the
great military road, one of the finest highways in the world.
It is macadamized, is fifty feet wide, ninety-seven miles in length,
and smooth and even as a boulevard. It crosses mountains which reach
a height of almost four thousand feet. It winds in and out among
the coffee-covered hills, giving us a fine view of the green mountains
and the deep valleys below.
Looking down we see patches of sugar cane and tobacco; groves of
bananas, cocoanut, and palm trees; hedges of strange growth; unknown
plants and vines, and fern-covered rocks.
Here and there is a rude cabin surrounded by bread-fruit and banana
trees. We pass picturesque little towns with blue and yellow houses
and quaint churches, their spires towering upward.
In fifteen hours we would reach San Juan, but we delay our journey
in order to obtain a closer view of the scenery and of the homes
of the people.
Many happy hours we spend on the plantations in the country.
During these country rides and visits we get our knowledge of the
animal and plant life of the island.
Let us stop, then, for a few days, at a country home by the
seashore.

This is an atom: 
A COUNTRY HOME.
The residence of this home we find to be of good size and divided
into rooms by partitions that reach only half way up to the roof.
This is to give a free circulation of air. The house is thatched
with palm leaves, and has a wide veranda running around it.
Mosquito curtains are used to keep out the swarms of sand flies and
mosquitoes that make the night uncomfortable.
All doors and windows are closed before sunset and not opened until
the moon is well up. Then large fires are lighted around the house
to drive the mosquitoes away. This is for our benefit, for the
natives do not mind these insects as much as we do. But we have
other midnight visitors.
Large fireflies fly in at the open windows and light up the room
with their fairy lamps. And such wonderful fireflies, over an inch
long!
The people, the children especially, are very fond of these fireflies
and frequently keep little cages of them for pets. They feed them
on sugar-cane juice and bathe them as if they were birds.
[Illustration: COUNTRY HOME OF THE BETTER CLASS.]
Little crabs rattle gaily over the floor and sometimes crawl into
our shoes, where we find them in the morning; friendly but ugly
lizards croak from the walls and roof, where they pass the night
hours in catching insects.
These lizards are found in and about most of the houses and are
harmless, useful little fellows.
They are six or seven inches long, of a pale, yellowish color,
mottled with brown.
Instead of taking a morning bath in our rooms, we take a dip in the
warm sea water. We find it hot, even very early in the morning; and
as we walk to the shore in our bathing suits, we make a large palm
leaf do duty as a sunshade.
When we dress for breakfast we examine our clothes very closely,
for the centipedes have a disagreeable way of taking strolls over
one's clothing and the bedding.
Our breakfast consists of turtle eggs, bread fruit, plantain and
cocoanut milk. Our meals are served on the veranda, and there we
spend the most of the day. Hammocks are swung from the beams, and,
lying in them, we drink in the cool sea air and feast our eyes upon
the beautiful surroundings.
In the shallow water near the shore we find great pink conch shells.
The fish in them we have made into soup for our dinner, and very
good soup we find it.
Sometimes we go out in the mountains with our host hunting for game,
or for mountain cabbage for our dinner. Perhaps others would like
to know what this mountain cabbage is, and we will tell them. It
is the bud of a palm tree, a part of the trunk of which, when young,
is edible.
When cooked, it looks like very white cabbage; but the flavor is
finer and more delicate. It is sometimes eaten raw, as a salad.
The meat for our dinner consists of fish, and the flesh of the
armadillo, the agouti and the iguana.
These animals are queer looking creatures. As we wish to see them
in their haunts in the woods and fields, we will accompany our host
on some long walks and drives, in order to find out more about
them.

ANIMAL LIFE.
When Columbus visited the West Indies, he was delighted by the
beauty in and about them. "I know not," he said, "where first to
go; nor are my eyes ever weary with gazing on the wonderful verdure.
The singing of the birds is such as to make one wish never to
depart."Meanwhile, extra diligence was required in the workroom; and Ruth found
no opportunity of going to see little Tom, or to fulfil the plans for making him and his grandmother
more comfortable, which she had proposed to herself. She regretted her rash promise to Mr Bellingham,
of attending to the little boy's welfare; all that she could do was done by means of Mrs Mason's
servant, through whom she made inquiries, and sent the necessary help.

This is an atom: 
The subject of Jenny's illness was the prominent one in the house. Ruth told of her own adventure,
to be sure; but when she was at the very crisis of the boy's fall into the river, the more
fresh and vivid interest of some tidings of Jenny was brought into the room, and Ruth ceased,
almost blaming herself for caring for anything besides the question of life or death to be
decided in that very house.

This is an atom: 
Then a pale, gentle-looking woman was seen moving softly about; and it was whispered that this
was the mother come to nurse her child. Everybody liked her, she was so sweet-looking, and
gave so little trouble, and seemed so patient, and so thankful for any inquiries about her
daughter, whose illness, it was understood, although its severity was mitigated, was likely
to be long and tedious. While all the feelings and thoughts relating to Jenny were predominant,
Sunday arrived. Mrs Mason went the accustomed visit to her father's, making some little show
of apology to Mrs Wood for leaving her and her daughter; the apprentices dispersed to the various
friends with whom they were in the habit of spending the day; and Ruth went to St Nicholas',
with a sorrowful heart, depressed on account of Jenny, and self-reproachful at having rashly
undertaken what she had been unable to perform.

This is an atom: 
As she came out of church, she was joined by Mr Bellingham. She had half hoped that he might
have forgotten the arrangement, and yet she wished to relieve herself of her responsibility.
She knew his step behind her, and the contending feelings made her heart beat hard, and she
longed to run away.

This is an atom: 
"Miss Hilton, I believe," said he, overtaking her, and bowing forward, so as to catch a sight
of her rose-red face. "How is our little sailor going on? Well, I trust, from the symptoms
the other day."

This is an atom: 
"I believe, sir, he is quite well now. I am very sorry, but I have not been able to go and
see him. I am so sorry--I could not help it. But I have got one or two things through another
person. I have put them down on this slip of paper; and here is your purse, sir, for I am afraid
I can do nothing more for him. We have illness in the house, and it makes us very busy."

This is an atom: 
Ruth had been so much accustomed to blame of late, that she almost anticipated some remonstrance
or reproach now, for not having fulfilled her promise better. She little guessed that Mr Bellingham
was far more busy trying to devise some excuse for meeting her again, during the silence that
succeeded her speech, than displeased with her for not bringing a more particular account of
the little boy, in whom he had ceased to feel any interest.

This is an atom: 
She repeated, after a minute's pause:

This is an atom: 
"I am very sorry I have done so little, sir."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes, I am sure you have done all you could. It was thoughtless in me to add to your engagements."

This is an atom: 
"He is displeased with me," thought Ruth, "for what he believes to have been neglect of the
boy, whose life he risked his own to save. If I told all, he would see that I could not do
more; but I cannot tell him all the sorrows and worries that have taken up my time."

This is an atom: 
"And yet I am tempted to give you another little commission, if it is not taking up too much
of your time, and presuming too much on your good-nature," said he, a bright idea having just
struck him. "Mrs Mason lives in Heneage Place, does not she? My mother's ancestors lived there;
and once, when the house was being repaired, she took me in to show me the old place. There
was an old hunting-piece painted on a panel over one of the chimney-pieces; the figures were
portraits of my ancestors. I have often thought I should like to purchase it, if it still remained
there. Can you ascertain this for me, and bring me word next Sunday?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes, sir," said Ruth, glad that this commission was completely within her power to execute,
and anxious to make up for her previous seeming neglect. "I'll look directly I get home, and
ask Mrs Mason to write and let you know."

This is an atom: 
"Thank you," said he, only half satisfied; "I think perhaps, however, it might be as well not
to trouble Mrs Mason about it; you see, it would compromise me, and I am not quite determined
to purchase the picture; if you would ascertain whether the painting is there, and tell me,
I would take a little time to reflect, and afterwards I could apply to Mrs Mason myself."

This is an atom: 
"Very well, sir; I will see about it." So they parted.

This is an atom: 
Before the next Sunday, Mrs Wood had taken her daughter to her distant home, to recruit in
that quiet place. Ruth watched her down the street from an upper window, and, sighing deep
and long, returned to the workroom, whence the warning voice and the gentle wisdom had departed.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER III

This is an atom: 
Sunday at Mrs Mason's

This is an atom: 
Mr Bellingham attended afternoon service at St Nicholas' church the next Sunday. His thoughts
had been far more occupied by Ruth than hers by him, although his appearance upon the scene
of her life was more an event to her than it was to him. He was puzzled by the impression she
had produced on him, though he did not in general analyse the nature of his feelings, but simply
enjoyed them with the delight which youth takes in experiencing new and strong emotion.

This is an atom: 
He was old compared to Ruth, but young as a man; hardly three-and-twenty. The fact of his being
an only child had given him, as it does to many, a sort of inequality in those parts of the
character which are usually formed by the number of years that a person has lived.

This is an atom: 
The unevenness of discipline to which only children are subjected; the thwarting, resulting
from over-anxiety; the indiscreet indulgence, arising from a love centred all in one object;
had been exaggerated in his education, probably from the circumstance that his mother (his
only surviving parent) had been similarly situated to himself.

This is an atom: 
He was already in possession of the comparatively small property he inherited from his father.
The estate on which his mother lived was her own; and her income gave her the means of indulging
or controlling him, after he had grown to man's estate, as her wayward disposition and her
love of power prompted her.

This is an atom: 
Had he been double-dealing in his conduct towards her, had he condescended to humour her in
the least, her passionate love for him would have induced her to strip herself of all her possessions
to add to his dignity or happiness. But although he felt the warmest affection for her, the
regardlessness which she had taught him (by example, perhaps, more than by precept) of the
feelings of others, was continually prompting him to do things that she, for the time being,
resented as mortal affronts. He would mimic the clergyman she specially esteemed, even to his
very face; he would refuse to visit her schools for months and months; and, when wearied into
going at last, revenge himself by puzzling the children with the most ridiculous questions
(gravely put) that he could imagine.

This is an atom: 
All these boyish tricks annoyed and irritated her far more than the accounts which reached
her of more serious misdoings at college and in town. Of these grave offences she never spoke;
of the smaller misdeeds she hardly ever ceased speaking.

This is an atom: 
Still, at times, she had great influence over him, and nothing delighted her more than to exercise
it. The submission of his will to hers was sure to be liberally rewarded; for it gave her great
happiness to extort, from his indifference or his affection, the concessions which she never
sought by force of reason, or by appeals to principle--concessions which he frequently withheld,
solely for the sake of asserting his independence of her control.

This is an atom: 
She was anxious for him to marry Miss Duncombe. He cared little or nothing about it--it was
time enough to be married ten years hence; and so he was dawdling through some months of his
life--sometimes flirting with the nothing-loath Miss Duncombe, sometimes plaguing, and sometimes
delighting his mother, at all times taking care to please himself--when he first saw Ruth Hilton,
and a new, passionate, hearty feeling shot through his whole being. He did not know why he
was so fascinated by her. She was very beautiful, but he had seen others equally beautiful,
and with many more _agaceries_ calculated to set off the effect of their charms.

This is an atom: 
There was, perhaps, something bewitching in the union of the grace and loveliness of womanhood
with the _naÃ¯vetÃ©_, simplicity, and innocence of an intelligent child. There was a spell in
the shyness, which made her avoid and shun all admiring approaches to acquaintance. It would
be an exquisite delight to attract and tame her wildness, just as he had often allured and
tamed the timid fawns in his mother's park.

This is an atom: 
By no over-bold admiration, or rash, passionate word, would he startle her; and, surely, in
time she might be induced to look upon him as a friend, if not something nearer and dearer still.

This is an atom: 
In accordance with this determination, he resisted the strong temptation of walking by her
side the whole distance home after church. He only received the intelligence she brought respecting
the panel with thanks, spoke a few words about the weather, bowed, and was gone. Ruth believed
she should never see him again; and, in spite of sundry self-upbraidings for her folly, she
could not help feeling as if a shadow were drawn over her existence for several days to come.

This is an atom: 
Mrs Mason was a widow, and had to struggle for the sake of the six or seven children left dependent
on her exertions; thus there was some reason, and great excuse, for the pinching economy which
regulated her household affairs.

This is an atom: 
On Sundays she chose to conclude that all her apprentices had friends who would be glad to
see them to dinner, and give them a welcome reception for the remainder of the day; while she,
and those of her children who were not at school, went to spend the day at her father's house,
several miles out of the town. Accordingly, no dinner was cooked on Sundays for the young workwomen;
no fires were lighted in any rooms to which they had access. On this morning they breakfasted
in Mrs Mason's own parlour, after which the room was closed against them through the day by
some understood, though unspoken prohibition.

This is an atom: 
What became of such as Ruth, who had no home and no friends in that large, populous, desolate
town? She had hitherto commissioned the servant, who went to market on Saturdays for the family,
to buy her a bun or biscuit, whereon she made her fasting dinner in the deserted workroom,
sitting in her walking-dress to keep off the cold, which clung to her in spite of shawl and
bonnet. Then she would sit at the window, looking out on the dreary prospect till her eyes
were often blinded by tears; and, partly to shake off thoughts and recollections, the indulgence
in which she felt to be productive of no good, and partly to have some ideas to dwell upon
during the coming week beyond those suggested by the constant view of the same room, she would
carry her Bible, and place herself in the window-seat on the wide landing, which commanded
the street in front of the house. From thence she could see the irregular grandeur of the place;
she caught a view of the grey church-tower, rising hoary and massive into mid-air; she saw
one or two figures loiter along on the sunny side of the street, in all the enjoyment of their
fine clothes and Sunday leisure; and she imagined histories for them, and tried to picture
to herself their homes and their daily doings.

This is an atom: 
And before long, the bells swung heavily in the church-tower, and struck out with musical clang
the first summons to afternoon church.

This is an atom: 
After church was over, she used to return home to the same window-seat, and watch till the
winter twilight was over and gone, and the stars came out over the black masses of houses.
And then she would steal down to ask for a candle, as a companion to her in the deserted workroom.
Occasionally the servant would bring her up some tea; but of late Ruth had declined taking
any, as she had discovered she was robbing the kind-hearted creature of part of the small provision
left out for her by Mrs Mason. She sat on, hungry and cold, trying to read her Bible, and to
think the old holy thoughts which had been her childish meditations at her mother's knee, until
one after another the apprentices returned, weary with their day's enjoyment, and their week's
late watching; too weary to make her in any way a partaker of their pleasure by entering into
details of the manner in which they had spent their day.

This is an atom: 
And last of all, Mrs Mason returned; and, summoning her "young people" once more into the parlour,
she read a prayer before dismissing them to bed. She always expected to find them all in the
house when she came home, but asked no questions as to their proceedings through the day; perhaps
because she dreaded to hear that one or two had occasionally nowhere to go, and that it would
be sometimes necessary to order a Sunday's dinner, and leave a lighted fire on that day.

This is an atom: 
For five months Ruth had been an inmate at Mrs Mason's, and such had been the regular order
of the Sundays. While the forewoman stayed there, it is true, she was ever ready to give Ruth
the little variety of hearing of recreations in which she was no partaker; and however tired
Jenny might be at night, she had ever some sympathy to bestow on Ruth for the dull length of
day she had passed. After her departure, the monotonous idleness of the Sunday seemed worse
to bear than the incessant labour of the work-days; until the time came when it seemed to be
a recognised hope in her mind, that on Sunday afternoons she should see Mr Bellingham, and
hear a few words from him, as from a friend who took an interest in her thoughts and proceedings
during the past week.

This is an atom: 
Ruth's mother had been the daughter of a poor curate in Norfolk, and, early left without parents
or home, she was thankful to marry a respectable farmer a good deal older than herself. After
their marriage, however, everything seemed to go wrong. Mrs Hilton fell into a delicate state
of health, and was unable to bestow the ever-watchful attention to domestic affairs so requisite
in a farmer's wife. Her husband had a series of misfortunes--of a more important kind than
the death of a whole brood of turkeys from getting among the nettles, or the year of bad cheeses
spoilt by a careless dairymaid--which were the consequences (so the neighbours said) of Mr
Hilton's mistake in marrying a delicate, fine lady. His crops failed; his horses died; his
barn took fire; in short, if he had been in any way a remarkable character, one might have
supposed him to be the object of an avenging fate, so successive were the evils which pursued
him; but as he was only a somewhat commonplace farmer, I believe we must attribute his calamities
to some want in his character of the one quality required to act as keystone to many excellences.
While his wife lived, all worldly misfortunes seemed as nothing to him; her strong sense and
lively faculty of hope upheld him from despair; her sympathy was always ready, and the invalid's
room had an atmosphere of peace and encouragement, which affected all who entered it. But when
Ruth was about twelve, one morning in the busy hay-time, Mrs Hilton was left alone for some
hours. This had often happened before, nor had she seemed weaker than usual when they had gone
forth to the field; but on their return, with merry voices, to fetch the dinner prepared for
the haymakers, they found an unusual silence brooding over the house; no low voice called out
gently to welcome them, and ask after the day's progress; and, on entering the little parlour,
which was called Mrs Hilton's, and was sacred to her, they found her lying dead on her accustomed
sofa. Quite calm and peaceful she lay; there had been no struggle at last; the struggle was
for the survivors, and one sank under it. Her husband did not make much ado at first--at least,
not in outward show; her memory seemed to keep in check all external violence of grief; but,
day by day, dating from his wife's death, his mental powers decreased. He was still a hale-looking
elderly man, and his bodily health appeared as good as ever; but he sat for hours in his easy-chair,
looking into the fire, not moving, nor speaking, unless when it was absolutely necessary to
answer repeated questions. If Ruth, with coaxings and draggings, induced him to come out with
her, he went with measured steps around his fields, his head bent to the ground with the same
abstracted, unseeing look; never smiling--never changing the expression of his face, not even
to one of deeper sadness, when anything occurred which might be supposed to remind him of his
dead wife. But in this abstraction from all outward things, his worldly affairs went ever lower
down. He paid money away, or received it, as if it had been so much water; the gold mines of
Potosi could not have touched the deep grief of his soul; but God in His mercy knew the sure
balm, and sent the Beautiful Messenger to take the weary one home.

This is an atom: 
After his death, the creditors were the chief people who appeared to take any interest in the
affairs; and it seemed strange to Ruth to see people, whom she scarcely knew, examining and
touching all that she had been accustomed to consider as precious and sacred. Her father had
made his will at her birth. With the pride of newly and late-acquired paternity, he had considered
the office of guardian to his little darling as one which would have been an additional honour
to the lord-lieutenant of the county; but as he had not the pleasure of his lordship's acquaintance,
he selected the person of most consequence amongst those whom he did know; not any very ambitious
appointment, in those days of comparative prosperity; but certainly the flourishing maltster
of Skelton was a little surprised, when, fifteen years later, he learnt that he was executor
to a will bequeathing many vanished hundreds of pounds, and guardian to a young girl whom he
could not remember ever to have seen.

This is an atom: 
He was a sensible, hard-headed man of the world; having a very fair proportion of conscience
as consciences go; indeed, perhaps more than many people; for he had some ideas of duty extending
to the circle beyond his own family; and did not, as some would have done, decline acting altogether,
but speedily summoned the creditors, examined into the accounts, sold up the farming-stock,
and discharged all the debts; paid about Â£80 into the Skelton bank for a week, while he inquired
for a situation or apprenticeship of some kind for poor heart-broken Ruth; heard of Mrs Mason's;
arranged all with her in two short conversations; drove over for Ruth in his gig; waited while
she and the old servant packed up her clothes; and grew very impatient while she ran, with
her eyes streaming with tears, round the garden, tearing off in a passion of love whole boughs
of favourite China and damask roses, late flowering against the casement-window of what had
been her mother's room. When she took her seat in the gig, she was little able, even if she
had been inclined, to profit by her guardian's lectures on economy and self-reliance; but she
was quiet and silent, looking forward with longing to the night-time, when, in her bedroom,
she might give way to all her passionate sorrow at being wrenched from the home where she had
lived with her parents, in that utter absence of any anticipation of change, which is either
the blessing or the curse of childhood. But at night there were four other girls in her room,
and she could not cry before them. She watched and waited till, one by one, they dropped off
to sleep, and then she buried her face in the pillow, and shook with sobbing grief; and then
she paused to conjure up, with fond luxuriance, every recollection of the happy days, so little
valued in their uneventful peace while they lasted, so passionately regretted when once gone
for ever; to remember every look and word of the dear mother, and to moan afresh over the change
caused by her death;--the first clouding in of Ruth's day of life. It was Jenny's sympathy
on this first night, when awakened by Ruth's irrepressible agony, that had made the bond between
them. But Ruth's loving disposition, continually sending forth fibres in search of nutriment,
found no other object for regard among those of her daily life to compensate for the want of
natural ties.

This is an atom: 
But, almost insensibly, Jenny's place in Ruth's heart was filled up; there was some one who
listened with tender interest to all her little revelations; who questioned her about her early
days of happiness, and, in return, spoke of his own childhood--not so golden in reality as
Ruth's, but more dazzling, when recounted with stories of the beautiful cream-coloured Arabian
pony, and the old picture-gallery in the house, and avenues, and terraces, and fountains in
the garden, for Ruth to paint, with all the vividness of imagination, as scenery and background
for the figure which was growing by slow degrees most prominent in her thoughts.

This is an atom: 
It must not be supposed that this was effected all at once, though the intermediate stages
have been passed over. On Sunday, Mr Bellingham only spoke to her to receive the information
about the panel; nor did he come to St Nicholas' the next, nor yet the following Sunday. But
the third he walked by her side a little way, and, seeing her annoyance, he left her; and then
she wished for him back again, and found the day very dreary, and wondered why a strange undefined
feeling had made her imagine she was doing wrong in walking alongside of one so kind and good
as Mr Bellingham; it had been very foolish of her to be self-conscious all the time, and if
ever he spoke to her again she would not think of what people might say, but enjoy the pleasure
which his kind words and evident interest in her might give. Then she thought it was very likely
he never would notice her again, for she knew she had been very rude with her short answers;
it was very provoking that she had behaved so rudely. She should be sixteen in another month,
and she was still childish and awkward. Thus she lectured herself, after parting with Mr Bellingham;
and the consequence was, that on the following Sunday she was ten times as blushing and conscious,
and (Mr Bellingham thought) ten times more beautiful than ever. He suggested, that instead
of going straight home through High-street, she should take the round by the Leasowes; at first
she declined, but then, suddenly wondering and questioning herself why she refused a thing
which was, as far as reason and knowledge (_her_ knowledge) went, so innocent, and which was
certainly so tempting and pleasant, she agreed to go the round; and when she was once in the
meadows that skirted the town, she forgot all doubt and awkwardness--nay, almost forgot the
presence of Mr Bellingham--in her delight at the new tender beauty of an early spring day in
February. Among the last year's brown ruins, heaped together by the wind in the hedgerows,
she found the fresh green crinkled leaves and pale star-like flowers of the primroses. Here
and there a golden celandine made brilliant the sides of the little brook that (full of water
in "February fill-dyke") bubbled along by the side of the path; the sun was low in the horizon,
and once, when they came to a higher part of the Leasowes, Ruth burst into an exclamation of
delight at the evening glory of mellow light which was in the sky behind the purple distance,
while the brown leafless woods in the foreground derived an almost metallic lustre from the
golden mist and haze of the sunset. It was but three-quarters of a mile round by the meadows,
but somehow it took them an hour to walk it. Ruth turned to thank Mr Bellingham for his kindness
in taking her home by this beautiful way, but his look of admiration at her glowing, animated
face, made her suddenly silent; and, hardly wishing him good-bye, she quickly entered the house
with a beating, happy, agitated heart.

This is an atom: 
"How strange it is," she thought that evening, "that I should feel as if this charming afternoon's
walk were, somehow, not exactly wrong, but yet as if it were not right. Why can it be? I am
not defrauding Mrs Mason of any of her time; that I know would be wrong; I am left to go where
I like on Sundays. I have been to church, so it can't be because I have missed doing my duty.
If I had gone this walk with Jenny, I wonder whether I should have felt as I do now. There
must be something wrong in me, myself, to feel so guilty when I have done nothing which is
not right; and yet I can thank God for the happiness I have had in this charming spring walk,
which dear mamma used to say was a sign when pleasures were innocent and good for us."

This is an atom: 
She was not conscious, as yet, that Mr Bellingham's presence had added any charm to the ramble;
and when she might have become aware of this, as, week after week, Sunday after Sunday, loitering
ramble after loitering ramble succeeded each other, she was too much absorbed with one set
of thoughts to have much inclination for self-questioning.

This is an atom: 
"Tell me everything, Ruth, as you would to a brother; let me help you, if I can, in your difficulties,"
he said to her one afternoon. And he really did try to understand, and to realise, how an insignificant
and paltry person like Mason the dressmaker could be an object of dread, and regarded as a
person having authority, by Ruth. He flamed up with indignation when, by way of impressing
him with Mrs Mason's power and consequence, Ruth spoke of some instance of the effects of her
employer's displeasure. He declared his mother should never have a gown made again by such
a tyrant--such a Mrs Brownrigg; that he would prevent all his acquaintances from going to such
a cruel dressmaker; till Ruth was alarmed at the threatened consequences of her one-sided account,
and pleaded for Mrs Mason as earnestly as if a young man's menace of this description were
likely to be literally fulfilled.

This is an atom: 
"Indeed, sir, I have been very wrong; if you please, sir, don't be so angry. She is often very
good to us; it is only sometimes she goes into a passion; and we are very provoking, I dare
say. I know I am for one. I have often to undo my work, and you can't think how it spoils anything
(particularly silk) to be unpicked; and Mrs Mason has to bear all the blame. Oh! I am sorry
I said anything about it. Don't speak to your mother about it, pray, sir. Mrs Mason thinks
so much of Mrs Bellingham's custom."

This is an atom: 
"Well, I won't this time"--recollecting that there might be some awkwardness in accounting
to his mother for the means by which he had obtained his very correct information as to what
passed in Mrs Mason's workroom--"but if ever she does so again, I'll not answer for myself."

This is an atom: 
"I will take care and not tell again, sir," said Ruth, in a low voice.

This is an atom: 
"Nay, Ruth, you are not going to have secrets from me, are you? Don't you remember your promise
to consider me as a brother? Go on telling me everything that happens to you, pray; you cannot
think how much interest I take in all your interests. I can quite fancy that charming home
at Milham you told me about last Sunday. I can almost fancy Mrs Mason's workroom; and that,
surely, is a proof either of the strength of my imagination, or of your powers of description."

This is an atom: 
Ruth smiled. "It is, indeed, sir. Our workroom must be so different to anything you ever saw.
I think you must have passed through Milham often on your way to Lowford."

This is an atom: 
"Then you don't think it is any stretch of fancy to have so clear an idea as I have of Milham
Grange? On the left hand of the road, is it, Ruth?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, sir, just over the bridge, and up the hill where the elm-trees meet overhead and make
a green shade; and then comes the dear old Grange, that I shall never see again."

This is an atom: 
"Never! Nonsense, Ruthie; it is only six miles off; you may see it any day. It is not an hour's
ride."

This is an atom: 
"Perhaps I may see it again when I am grown old; I did not think exactly what 'never' meant;
it is so very long since I was there, and I don't see any chance of my going for years and
years, at any rate."

This is an atom: 
"Why, Ruth, you--we may go next Sunday afternoon, if you like."

This is an atom: 
She looked up at him with a lovely light of pleasure in her face at the idea. "How, sir? Can
I walk it between afternoon service and the time Mrs Mason comes home? I would go for only
one glimpse; but if I could get into the house--oh, sir! if I could just see mamma's room again!"

This is an atom: 
He was revolving plans in his head for giving her this pleasure, and he had also his own in
view. If they went in any of his carriages, the loitering charm of the walk would be lost;
and they must, to a certain degree, be encumbered by, and exposed to, the notice of servants.

This is an atom: 
"Are you a good walker, Ruth? Do you think you can manage six miles? If we set off at two o'clock,
we shall be there by four, without hurrying; or say half-past four. Then we might stay two
hours, and you could show me all the old walks and old places you love, and we could still
come leisurely home. Oh, it's all arranged directly!"

This is an atom: 
"But do you think it would be right, sir? It seems as if it would be such a great pleasure,
that it must be in some way wrong."

This is an atom: 
"Why, you little goose, what can be wrong in it?"

This is an atom: 
"In the first place, I miss going to church by setting out at two," said Ruth, a little gravely.

This is an atom: 
"Only for once. Surely you don't see any harm in missing church for once? You will go in the
morning, you know."

This is an atom: 
"I wonder if Mrs Mason would think it right--if she would allow it?"

This is an atom: 
"No, I dare say not. But you don't mean to be governed by Mrs Mason's notions of right and
wrong. She thought it right to treat that poor girl Palmer in the way you told me about. You
would think that wrong, you know, and so would every one of sense and feeling. Come, Ruth,
don't pin your faith on any one, but judge for yourself. The pleasure is perfectly innocent;
it is not a selfish pleasure either, for I shall enjoy it to the full as much as you will.
I shall like to see the places where you spent your childhood; I shall almost love them as
much as you do." He had dropped his voice; and spoke in low, persuasive tones. Ruth hung down
her head, and blushed with exceeding happiness; but she could not speak, even to urge her doubts
afresh. Thus it was in a manner settled.

This is an atom: 
How delightfully happy the plan made her through the coming week! She was too young when her
mother died to have received any cautions or words of advice respecting _the_ subject of a
woman's life--if, indeed, wise parents ever directly speak of what, in its depth and power,
cannot be put into words--which is a brooding spirit with no definite form or shape that men
should know it, but which is there, and present before we have recognised and realised its
existence. Ruth was innocent and snow-pure. She had heard of falling in love, but did not know
the signs and symptoms thereof; nor, indeed, had she troubled her head much about them. Sorrow
had filled up her days, to the exclusion of all lighter thoughts than the consideration of
present duties, and the remembrance of the happy time which had been. But the interval of blank,
after the loss of her mother and during her father's life-in-death, had made her all the more
ready to value and cling to sympathy--first from Jenny, and now from Mr Bellingham. To see
her home again, and to see it with him; to show him (secure of his interest) the haunts of
former times, each with its little tale of the past--of dead and gone events!--No coming shadow
threw its gloom over this week's dream of happiness--a dream which was too bright to be spoken
about to common and indifferent ears.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER IV

This is an atom: 
Treading in Perilous Places

This is an atom: 
Sunday came, as brilliant as if there were no sorrow, or death, or guilt in the world; a day
or two of rain had made the earth fresh and brave as the blue heavens above. Ruth thought it
was too strong a realisation of her hopes, and looked for an over-clouding at noon; but the
glory endured, and at two o'clock she was in the Leasowes, with a beating heart full of joy,
longing to stop the hours, which would pass too quickly through the afternoon.

This is an atom: 
They sauntered through the fragrant lanes, as if their loitering would prolong the time, and
check the fiery-footed steeds galloping apace towards the close of the happy day. It was past
five o'clock before they came to the great mill-wheel, which stood in Sabbath idleness, motionless
in a brown mass of shade, and still wet with yesterday's immersion in the deep transparent
water beneath. They clambered the little hill, not yet fully shaded by the overarching elms;
and then Ruth checked Mr Bellingham, by a slight motion of the hand which lay within his arm,
and glanced up into his face to see what that face should express as it looked on Milham Grange,
now lying still and peaceful in its afternoon shadows. It was a house of after-thoughts; building
materials were plentiful in the neighbourhood, and every successive owner had found a necessity
for some addition or projection, till it was a picturesque mass of irregularity--of broken
light and shadow--which, as a whole, gave a full and complete idea of a "Home." All its gables
and nooks were blended and held together by the tender green of the climbing roses and young
creepers. An old couple were living in the house until it should be let, but they dwelt in
the back part, and never used the front door; so the little birds had grown tame and familiar,
and perched upon the window-sills and porch, and on the old stone cistern which caught the
water from the roof.

This is an atom: 
They went silently through the untrimmed garden, full of the pale-coloured flowers of spring.
A spider had spread her web over the front door. The sight of this conveyed a sense of desolation
to Ruth's heart; she thought it was possible the state entrance had never been used since her
father's dead body had been borne forth, and, without speaking a word, she turned abruptly
away, and went round the house to another door. Mr Bellingham followed without questioning,
little understanding her feelings, but full of admiration for the varying expression called
out upon her face.

This is an atom: 
The old woman had not yet returned from church, or from the weekly gossip or neighbourly tea
which succeeded. The husband sat in the kitchen, spelling the psalms for the day in his Prayer-book,
and reading the words out aloud--a habit he had acquired from the double solitude of his life,
for he was deaf. He did not hear the quiet entrance of the pair, and they were struck with
the sort of ghostly echo which seems to haunt half-furnished and uninhabited houses. The verses
he was reading were the following:

This is an atom: 
Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so
   disquieted within me?

This is an atom: 
O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is
   the help of my countenance, and my God.

This is an atom: 
And when he had finished he shut the book, and sighed with the satisfaction of having done
his duty. The words of holy trust, though perhaps they were not fully understood, carried a
faithful peace down into the depths of his soul. As he looked up, he saw the young couple standing
on the middle of the floor. He pushed his iron-rimmed spectacles on to his forehead, and rose
to greet the daughter of his old master and ever-honoured mistress.

This is an atom: 
"God bless thee, lass; God bless thee! My old eyes are glad to see thee again."

This is an atom: 
Ruth sprang forward to shake the horny hand stretched forward in the action of blessing. She
pressed it between both of hers, as she rapidly poured out questions. Mr Bellingham was not
altogether comfortable at seeing one whom he had already begun to appropriate as his own, so
tenderly familiar with a hard-featured, meanly-dressed day-labourer. He sauntered to the window,
and looked out into the grass-grown farm-yard; but he could not help overhearing some of the
conversation, which seemed to him carried on too much in the tone of equality. "And who's yon?"
asked the old labourer at last. "Is he your sweetheart? Your missis's son, I reckon. He's a
spruce young chap, anyhow."

This is an atom: 
Mr Bellingham's "blood of all the Howards" rose and tingled about his ears, so that he could
not hear Ruth's answer. It began by "Hush, Thomas; pray hush!" but how it went on he did not
catch. The idea of his being Mrs Mason's son! It was really too ridiculous; but, like most
things which are "too ridiculous," it made him very angry. He was hardly himself again when
Ruth shyly came to the window-recess and asked him if he would like to see the house-place,
into which the front door entered; many people thought it very pretty, she said, half timidly,
for his face had unconsciously assumed a hard and haughty expression, which he could not instantly
soften down. He followed her, however; but before he left the kitchen he saw the old man standing,
looking at Ruth's companion with a strange, grave air of dissatisfaction.

This is an atom: 
They went along one or two zigzag, damp-smelling stone passages, and then entered the house-place,
or common sitting-room for a farmer's family in that part of the country. The front door opened
into it, and several other apartments issued out of it, such as the dairy, the state bedroom
(which was half-parlour as well), and a small room which had been appropriated to the late
Mrs Hilton, where she sat, or more frequently lay, commanding through the open door the comings
and goings of her household. In those days the house-place had been a cheerful room, full of
life, with the passing to and fro of husband, child, and servants; with a great merry wood
fire crackling and blazing away every evening, and hardly let out in the very heat of summer;
for with the thick stone walls, and the deep window-seats, and the drapery of vine-leaves and
ivy, that room, with its flag-floor, seemed always to want the sparkle and cheery warmth of
a fire. But now the green shadows from without seemed to have become black in the uninhabited
desolation. The oaken shovel-board, the heavy dresser, and the carved cupboards, were now dull
and damp, which were formerly polished up to the brightness of a looking-glass where the fire-blaze
was for ever glinting; they only added to the oppressive gloom; the flag-floor was wet with
heavy moisture. Ruth stood gazing into the room, seeing nothing of what was present. She saw
a vision of former days--an evening in the days of her childhood; her father sitting in the
"master's corner" near the fire, sedately smoking his pipe, while he dreamily watched his wife
and child; her mother reading to her, as she sat on a little stool at her feet. It was gone--all
gone into the land of shadows; but for the moment it seemed so present in the old room, that
Ruth believed her actual life to be the dream. Then, still silent, she went on into her mother's
parlour. But there, the bleak look of what had once been full of peace and mother's love, struck
cold on her heart. She uttered a cry, and threw herself down by the sofa, hiding her face in
her hands, while her frame quivered with her repressed sobs.

This is an atom: 
"Dearest Ruth, don't give way so. It can do no good; it cannot bring back the dead," said Mr
Bellingham, distressed at witnessing her distress.

This is an atom: 
"I know it cannot," murmured Ruth; "and that is why I cry. I cry because nothing will ever
bring them back again." She sobbed afresh, but more gently, for his kind words soothed her,
and softened, if they could not take away, her sense of desolation.

This is an atom: 
"Come away; I cannot have you stay here, full of painful associations as these rooms must be.
Come"--raising her with gentle violence--"show me your little garden you have often told me
about. Near the window of this very room, is it not? See how well I remember everything you
tell me."

This is an atom: 
He led her round through the back part of the house into the pretty old-fashioned garden. There
was a sunny border just under the windows, and clipped box and yew-trees by the grass-plat,
further away from the house; and she prattled again of her childish adventures and solitary
plays. When they turned round they saw the old man, who had hobbled out with the help of his
stick, and was looking at them with the same grave, sad look of anxiety.

This is an atom: 
Mr Bellingham spoke rather sharply:

This is an atom: 
"Why does that old man follow us about in that way? It is excessively impertinent of him, I think."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, don't call old Thomas impertinent. He is so good and kind, he is like a father to me.
I remember sitting on his knee many and many a time when I was a child, whilst he told me stories
out of the 'Pilgrim's Progress.' He taught me to suck up milk through a straw. Mamma was very
fond of him too. He used to sit with us always in the evenings when papa was away at market,
for mamma was rather afraid of having no man in the house, and used to beg old Thomas to stay;
and he would take me on his knee, and listen just as attentively as I did while mamma read aloud."

This is an atom: 
"You don't mean to say you have sat upon that old fellow's knee?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes! many and many a time."

This is an atom: 
Mr Bellingham looked graver than he had done while witnessing Ruth's passionate emotion in
her mother's room. But he lost his sense of indignity in admiration of his companion as she
wandered among the flowers, seeking for favourite bushes or plants, to which some history or
remembrance was attached. She wound in and out in natural, graceful, wavy lines between the
luxuriant and overgrown shrubs, which were fragrant with a leafy smell of spring growth; she
went on, careless of watching eyes, indeed unconscious, for the time, of their existence. Once
she stopped to take hold of a spray of jessamine, and softly kiss it; it had been her mother's
favourite flower.

This is an atom: 
Old Thomas was standing by the horse-mount, and was also an observer of all her goings-on.
But, while Mr Bellingham's feeling was that of passionate admiration mingled with a selfish
kind of love, the old man gazed with tender anxiety, and his lips moved in words of blessing:

This is an atom: 
"She's a pretty creature, with a glint of her mother about her; and she's the same kind lass
as ever. Not a bit set up with yon fine manty-maker's shop she's in. I misdoubt that young
fellow though, for all she called him a real gentleman, and checked me when I asked if he was
her sweetheart. If his are not sweetheart's looks, I've forgotten all my young days. Here!
they're going, I suppose. Look! he wants her to go without a word to the old man; but she is
none so changed as that, I reckon."

This is an atom: 
Not Ruth, indeed! She never perceived the dissatisfied expression of Mr Bellingham's countenance,
visible to the old man's keen eye; but came running up to Thomas to send her love to his wife,
and to shake him many times by the hand.

This is an atom: 
"Tell Mary I'll make her such a fine gown, as soon as ever I set up for myself; it shall be
all in the fashion, big gigot sleeves, that she shall not know herself in them! Mind you tell
her that, Thomas, will you?"

This is an atom: 
"Aye, that I will, lass; and I reckon she'll be pleased to hear thou hast not forgotten thy
old merry ways. The Lord bless thee--the Lord lift up the light of His countenance upon thee."

This is an atom: 
Ruth was half-way towards the impatient Mr Bellingham when her old friend called her back.
He longed to give her a warning of the danger that he thought she was in, and yet he did not
know how. When she came up, all he could think of to say was a text; indeed, the language of
the Bible was the language in which he thought, whenever his ideas went beyond practical everyday
life into expressions of emotion or feeling. "My dear, remember the devil goeth about as a
roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour; remember that, Ruth."

This is an atom: 
The words fell on her ear, but gave no definite idea. The utmost they suggested was the remembrance
of the dread she felt as a child when this verse came into her mind, and how she used to imagine
a lion's head with glaring eyes peering out of the bushes in a dark shady part of the wood,
which, for this reason, she had always avoided, and even now could hardly think of without
a shudder. She never imagined that the grim warning related to the handsome young man who awaited
her with a countenance beaming with love, and tenderly drew her hand within his arm.

This is an atom: 
The old man sighed as he watched them away. "The Lord may help her to guide her steps aright.
He may. But I'm afeard she's treading in perilous places. I'll put my missis up to going to
the town and getting speech of her, and telling her a bit of her danger. An old motherly woman
like our Mary will set about it better nor a stupid fellow like me."

This is an atom: 
The poor old labourer prayed long and earnestly that night for Ruth. He called it "wrestling
for her soul;" and I think his prayers were heard, for "God judgeth not as man judgeth."

This is an atom: 
Ruth went on her way, all unconscious of the dark phantoms of the future that were gathering
around her; her melancholy turned, with the pliancy of childish years, at sixteen not yet lost,
into a softened manner which was infinitely charming. By-and-by she cleared up into sunny happiness.
The evening was still and full of mellow light, and the new-born summer was so delicious that,
in common with all young creatures, she shared its influence and was glad.

This is an atom: 
They stood together at the top of a steep ascent, "the hill" of the hundred. At the summit
there was a level space, sixty or seventy yards square, of unenclosed and broken ground, over
which the golden bloom of the gorse cast a rich hue, while its delicious scent perfumed the
fresh and nimble air. On one side of this common, the ground sloped down to a clear bright
pond, in which were mirrored the rough sand-cliffs that rose abrupt on the opposite bank; hundreds
of martens found a home there, and were now wheeling over the transparent water, and dipping
in their wings in their evening sport. Indeed, all sorts of birds seemed to haunt the lonely
pool; the water-wagtails were scattered around its margin, the linnets perched on the topmost
sprays of the gorse-bushes, and other hidden warblers sang their vespers on the uneven ground
beyond. On the far side of the green waste, close by the road, and well placed for the requirements
of horses or their riders who might be weary with the ascent of the hill, there was a public-house,
which was more of a farm than an inn. It was a long, low building, rich in dormer-windows on
the weather side, which were necessary in such an exposed situation, and with odd projections
and unlooked-for gables on every side; there was a deep porch in front, on whose hospitable
benches a dozen persons might sit and enjoy the balmy air. A noble sycamore grew right before
the house, with seats all round it ("such tents the patriarchs loved"); and a nondescript sign
hung from a branch on the side next to the road, which, being wisely furnished with an interpretation,
was found to mean King Charles in the oak.

This is an atom: 
Near this comfortable, quiet, unfrequented inn, there was another pond, for household and farm-yard
purposes, from which the cattle were drinking, before returning to the fields after they had
been milked. Their very motions were so lazy and slow, that they served to fill up the mind
with the sensation of dreamy rest. Ruth and Mr Bellingham plunged through the broken ground
to regain the road near the wayside inn. Hand-in-hand, now pricked by the far-spreading gorse,
now ankle-deep in sand; now pressing the soft, thick heath, which should make so brave an autumn
show; and now over wild thyme and other fragrant herbs, they made their way, with many a merry
laugh. Once on the road, at the summit, Ruth stood silent, in breathless delight at the view
before her. The hill fell suddenly down into the plain, extending for a dozen miles or more.
There was a clump of dark Scotch firs close to them, which cut clear against the western sky,
and threw back the nearest levels into distance. The plain below them was richly wooded, and
was tinted by the young tender hues of the earliest summer, for all the trees of the wood had
donned their leaves except the cautious ash, which here and there gave a soft, pleasant greyness
to the landscape. Far away in the champaign were spires, and towers, and stacks of chimneys
belonging to some distant hidden farm-house, which were traced downwards through the golden
air by the thin columns of blue smoke sent up from the evening fires. The view was bounded
by some rising ground in deep purple shadow against the sunset sky.

This is an atom: 
When first they stopped, silent with sighing pleasure, the air seemed full of pleasant noises;
distant church-bells made harmonious music with the little singing-birds near at hand; nor
were the lowings of the cattle, nor the calls of the farm-servants discordant, for the voices
seemed to be hushed by the brooding consciousness of the Sabbath. They stood loitering before
the house, quietly enjoying the view. The clock in the little inn struck eight, and it sounded
clear and sharp in the stillness.

This is an atom: 
"Can it be so late?" asked Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"I should not have thought it possible," answered Mr Bellingham. "But, never mind, you will
be at home long before nine. Stay, there is a shorter road, I know, through the fields; just
wait a moment, while I go in and ask the exact way." He dropped Ruth's arm, and went into the
public-house.

This is an atom: 
A gig had been slowly toiling up the sandy hill behind, unperceived by the young couple, and
now it reached the table-land, and was close upon them as they separated. Ruth turned round,
when the sound of the horse's footsteps came distinctly as he reached the level. She faced
Mrs Mason!

This is an atom: 
They were not ten--no, not five yards apart. At the same moment they recognised each other,
and, what was worse, Mrs Mason had clearly seen, with her sharp, needle-like eyes, the attitude
in which Ruth had stood with the young man who had just quitted her. Ruth's hand had been lying
in his arm, and fondly held there by his other hand.

This is an atom: 
Mrs Mason was careless about the circumstances of temptation into which the girls entrusted
to her as apprentices were thrown, but severely intolerant if their conduct was in any degree
influenced by the force of these temptations. She called this intolerance "keeping up the character
of her establishment." It would have been a better and more Christian thing, if she had kept
up the character of her girls by tender vigilance and maternal care.

This is an atom: 
This evening, too, she was in an irritated state of temper. Her brother had undertaken to drive
her round by Henbury, in order to give her the unpleasant information of the misbehaviour of
her eldest son, who was an assistant in a draper's shop in a neighbouring town. She was full
of indignation against want of steadiness, though not willing to direct her indignation against
the right object--her ne'er-do-well darling. While she was thus charged with anger (for her
brother justly defended her son's master and companions from her attacks), she saw Ruth standing
with a lover, far away from home, at such a time in the evening, and she boiled over with intemperate
displeasure.

This is an atom: 
"Come here directly, Miss Hilton," she exclaimed, sharply. Then, dropping her voice to low,
bitter tones of concentrated wrath, she said to the trembling, guilty Ruth:

This is an atom: 
"Don't attempt to show your face at my house again after this conduct. I saw you, and your
spark, too. I'll have no slurs on the character of my apprentices. Don't say a word. I saw
enough. I shall write and tell your guardian to-morrow."

This is an atom: 
The horse started away, for he was impatient to be off, and Ruth was left standing there, stony,
sick, and pale, as if the lightning had torn up the ground beneath her feet. She could not
go on standing, she was so sick and faint; she staggered back to the broken sand-bank, and
sank down, and covered her face with her hands.

This is an atom: 
"My dearest Ruth! are you ill? Speak, darling! My love, my love, do speak to me!"

This is an atom: 
What tender words after such harsh ones! They loosened the fountain of Ruth's tears, and she
cried bitterly.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! did you see her--did you hear what she said?"

This is an atom: 
"She! Who, my darling? Don't sob so, Ruth; tell me what it is. Who has been near you?--who
has been speaking to you to make you cry so?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Mrs Mason." And there was a fresh burst of sorrow.

This is an atom: 
"You don't say so! are you sure? I was not away five minutes."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes, sir, I'm quite sure. She was so angry; she said I must never show my face there again.
Oh, dear! what shall I do?"

This is an atom: 
It seemed to the poor child as if Mrs Mason's words were irrevocable, and, that being so, she
was shut out from every house. She saw how much she had done that was deserving of blame, now
when it was too late to undo it. She knew with what severity and taunts Mrs Mason had often
treated her for involuntary failings, of which she had been quite unconscious; and now she
had really done wrong, and shrank with terror from the consequences. Her eyes were so blinded
by the fast-falling tears, she did not see (nor had she seen would she have been able to interpret)
the change in Mr Bellingham's countenance, as he stood silently watching her. He was silent
so long, that even in her sorrow she began to wonder that he did not speak, and to wish to
hear his soothing words once more.

This is an atom: 
"It is very unfortunate," he began, at last; and then he stopped; then he began again: "It
is very unfortunate; for, you see, I did not like to name it to you before, but, I believe--I
have business, in fact, which obliges me to go to town to-morrow--to London, I mean; and I
don't know when I shall be able to return."

This is an atom: 
"To London!" cried Ruth; "are you going away? Oh, Mr Bellingham!" She wept afresh, giving herself
up to the desolate feeling of sorrow, which absorbed all the terror she had been experiencing
at the idea of Mrs Mason's anger. It seemed to her at this moment as though she could have
borne everything but his departure; but she did not speak again; and after two or three minutes
had elapsed, he spoke--not in his natural careless voice, but in a sort of constrained, agitated
tone.

This is an atom: 
"I can hardly bear the idea of leaving you, my own Ruth. In such distress, too; for where you
can go I do not know at all. From all you have told me of Mrs Mason, I don't think she is likely
to mitigate her severity in your case."

This is an atom: 
No answer, but tears quietly, incessantly flowing. Mrs Mason's displeasure seemed a distant
thing; his going away was the present distress. He went on:

This is an atom: 
"Ruth, would you go with me to London? My darling, I cannot leave you here without a home;
the thought of leaving you at all is pain enough, but in these circumstances--so friendless,
so homeless--it is impossible. You must come with me, love, and trust to me."

This is an atom: 
Still she did not speak. Remember how young, and innocent, and motherless she was! It seemed
to her as if it would be happiness enough to be with him; and as for the future, he would arrange
and decide for that. The future lay wrapped in a golden mist, which she did not care to penetrate;
but if he, her sun, was out of sight and gone, the golden mist became dark heavy gloom, through
which no hope could come. He took her hand.

This is an atom: 
"Will you not come with me? Do you not love me enough to trust me? Oh, Ruth," (reproachfully),
"can you not trust me?"

This is an atom: 
She had stopped crying, but was sobbing sadly.

This is an atom: 
"I cannot bear this, love. Your sorrow is absolute pain to me; but it is worse to feel how
indifferent you are--how little you care about our separation."

This is an atom: 
He dropped her hand. She burst into a fresh fit of crying.

This is an atom: 
"I may have to join my mother in Paris; I don't know when I shall see you again. Oh, Ruth!"
said he, vehemently, "do you love me at all?"

This is an atom: 
She said something in a very low voice; he could not hear it, though he bent down his head--but
he took her hand again.

This is an atom: 
"What was it you said, love? Was it not that you did love me? My darling, you do! I can tell
it by the trembling of this little hand; then you will not suffer me to go away alone and unhappy,
most anxious about you? There is no other course open to you; my poor girl has no friends to
receive her. I will go home directly, and return in an hour with a carriage. You make me too
happy by your silence, Ruth."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, what can I do!" exclaimed Ruth. "Mr Bellingham, you should help me, and instead of that
you only bewilder me."

This is an atom: 
"How, my dearest Ruth? Bewilder you! It seems so clear to me. Look at the case fairly! Here
you are, an orphan, with only one person to love you, poor child!--thrown off, for no fault
of yours, by the only creature on whom you have a claim, that creature a tyrannical, inflexible
woman; what is more natural (and, being natural, more right) than that you should throw yourself
upon the care of the one who loves you dearly--who would go through fire and water for you--who
would shelter you from all harm? Unless, indeed, as I suspect, you do not care for him. If
so, Ruth! if you do not care for me, we had better part--I will leave you at once; it will
be better for me to go, if you do not care for me."

This is an atom: 
He said this very sadly (it seemed so to Ruth, at least), and made as though he would have
drawn his hand from hers, but now she held it with soft force.

This is an atom: 
"Don't leave me, please, sir. It is very true I have no friend but you. Don't leave me, please.
But, oh! do tell me what I must do!"

This is an atom: 
"Will you do it if I tell you? If you will trust me, I will do my very best for you. I will
give you my best advice. You see your position. Mrs Mason writes and gives her own exaggerated
account to your guardian; he is bound by no great love to you, from what I have heard you say,
and throws you off; I, who might be able to befriend you--through my mother, perhaps--I, who
could at least comfort you a little (could not I, Ruth?), am away, far away, for an indefinite
time; that is your position at present. Now, what I advise is this. Come with me into this
little inn; I will order tea for you--(I am sure you require it sadly)--and I will leave you
there, and go home for the carriage. I will return in an hour at the latest. Then we are together,
come what may; that is enough for me; is it not for you, Ruth? Say, yes--say it ever so low,
but give me the delight of hearing it. Ruth, say yes."

This is an atom: 
Low and soft, with much hesitation, came the "Yes;" the fatal word of which she so little imagined
the infinite consequences. The thought of being with him was all and everything.

This is an atom: 
"How you tremble, my darling! You are cold, love! Come into the house, and I'll order tea directly
and be off."

This is an atom: 
She rose, and, leaning on his arm, went into the house. She was shaking and dizzy with the
agitation of the last hour. He spoke to the civil farmer-landlord, who conducted them into
a neat parlour, with windows opening into the garden at the back of the house. They had admitted
much of the evening's fragrance through their open casements, before they were hastily closed
by the attentive host.

This is an atom: 
"Tea, directly, for this lady!" The landlord vanished.

This is an atom: 
"Dearest Ruth, I must go; there is not an instant to be lost; promise me to take some tea,
for you are shivering all over, and deadly pale with the fright that abominable woman has given
you. I must go; I shall be back in half an hour--and then no more partings, darling."

This is an atom: 
He kissed her pale cold face, and went away. The room whirled round before Ruth; it was a dream--a
strange, varying, shifting dream--with the old home of her childhood for one scene, with the
terror of Mrs Mason's unexpected appearance for another; and then, strangest, dizziest, happiest
of all, there was the consciousness of his love, who was all the world to her; and the remembrance
of the tender words, which still kept up their low soft echo in her heart.

This is an atom: 
Her head ached so much that she could hardly see; even the dusky twilight was a dazzling glare
to her poor eyes; and when the daughter of the house brought in the sharp light of the candles,
preparatory for tea, Ruth hid her face in the sofa pillows with a low exclamation of pain.

This is an atom: 
"Does your head ache, miss?" asked the girl, in a gentle, sympathising voice. "Let me make
you some tea, miss, it will do you good. Many's the time poor mother's headaches were cured
by good strong tea."

This is an atom: 
Ruth murmured acquiescence; the young girl (about Ruth's own age, but who was the mistress
of the little establishment, owing to her mother's death) made tea, and brought Ruth a cup
to the sofa where she lay. Ruth was feverish and thirsty, and eagerly drank it off, although
she could not touch the bread and butter which the girl offered her. She felt better and fresher,
though she was still faint and weak.

This is an atom: 
"Thank you," said Ruth. "Don't let me keep you; perhaps you are busy. You have been very kind,
and the tea has done me a great deal of good."

This is an atom: 
But, Puritan as he was, we can admire Cromwell. Every great man, in whatever times, or in whatever
part of the world he has made his appearance, has earned his title to fame and distinction, not
by qualities peculiar to the sect or religion to which he may have belonged, but qualities
which, though connected with his own especial faith or tenets, are recognised as the common
property of mankind; he has been great not as Catholic, as Puritan, as Pagan, as Mahometan,
but as _man_; he has been great, because he was pious, brave, patriotic, sagacious, resolute,
and has achieved great enterprises on the theatre of life.

This is an atom: 
The greatness of Cromwell was indeed allied to Puritanism, inasmuch as his mind grew up under
this peculiar form of religion; but what we, and all posterity must admire in Cromwell, is by
no means the puritan. His steadiness of purpose, his unshaken resolution, his military
prowess, his eminent talent to govern and command, and his religious sense of duty to the
Supreme, might all have existed under other modes of religion. In our admiration we entirely
separate these qualities from that least gainly and least wholesome of the forms of Christian piety
with which they are here found connected.

This is an atom: 
History gives us examples of every kind of virtue, and every kind of talent, united with every
species of fanaticism that has afflicted civilised life. It follows not that we applaud the fanaticism.
The early caliphs were several of them distinguished by exalted virtues, temperance, self-denial,
justice, patriotism: we praise these virtues, we acknowledge, too, that they are here linked
with the profession of the faith of Islam; but for all this we do not admire the religion
of Mahomet, nor that fanaticism which writ its texts upon the sword.

This is an atom: 
We insist upon this obvious distinction, because, whilst agreeing--_to a certain extent_--in
Mr Carlyle's view of the character of Cromwell, we beg not to be implicated in that esteem and
reverence which he professes to entertain for Puritanism, or the Puritans as a body. And this brings
us to the extraordinary part of Mr Carlyle's performance--his ardent sympathy, nay his
acquiescence with, and adherence to the Puritans, to that point that he adopts their
convictions, their feelings, and even some of their most grotesque reasonings. Their violence
and ferocity, we were prepared to see Mr Carlyle, in his own sardonic fashion, abet and
encourage; his sympathy is always with the party _who strikes_; but that he should identify
himself with their mumming thoughts, their "plentiful reasons," their gloomiest superstitions, was
what no one could have anticipated.

This is an atom: 
On this subject we must quote his own words; our own would not be credited; they would seem
to any one who had not read his work to be scandalous misrepresentations.
The extravagance runs through the whole book, but we have it perhaps more concentrated in the
Introduction.

This is an atom: 
This Introduction, which we sat down to with keen expectations,
disappointed us extremely, at least in those parts where any general
views are taken.

This is an atom: 
We feel, and have elsewhere ungrudgingly expressed, a certain admiration for the talents of
Mr Carlyle. We shall never forget the surprise and pleasure with which we read the "Sartor
Resartus," as it one day burst suddenly and accidentally upon us; and no one who has once
read his graphic and passionate history of the French Revolution,
can ever forget the vivid pictures that were there presented to him.

This is an atom: 
We opened this book, therefore, with a sort of anticipatory relish.

This is an atom: 
But we found very little of his genius, and very much of his
extravagance; less of the one and more of the other, than we thought
could possibly have been brought together.

This is an atom: 
Metaphors and allusions, already worn thread-bare, are introduced as stock phrases, as if he had
inserted them in his dictionary of the English language. All his vices of manner are exaggerated,
while the freshness of thought, which half excused them, is departed. These strange metaphors,
these glaring colours, which are ready spread out upon his palette, he transfers with hasty
profusion to his canvass, till--(as it has been said of Mr Turner's, pictures)--the canvass and
the palette-plate very nearly resemble. But were it otherwise, were there all and more than
the wit, and humour, and sarcasm, and pungent phrase, and graphic power, which may be found
scattered through Mr Carlyle's best performances, there is here a substratum of sheer and violent
absurdity, which all these together would fail to disguise or compensate. Certainly there are
pages of writing in this Introduction which contain such an amount of extravagant assertion, uttered
in such fantastic jargon, as we think could nowhere be paralleled. Dulness could never have
attained to any thing so extraordinary; and surely genius never before condescended to such
workmanship.

This is an atom: 
"What and how great," thus commences the book, "are the interests which connect themselves
with the hope that England may yet attain to some, practical belief and understanding of its
history during the seventeenth century, need not be insisted on at present, such hope being
still very distant, very uncertain. We have wandered far away from the ideas which guided
us in that century, _and indeed which had guided us in all preceding centuries, but of which
that century was the ultimate manifestation_.

This is an atom: 
We have wandered very far, and must endeavour to return and connect ourselves therewith
again! It is with other feelings than those of poor peddling dilettantism, other aims than
the writing of successful or unsuccessful publications, that an earnest man occupies himself
in those dreary provinces of the dead and buried.

This is an atom: 
The _last glimpse of the godlike_ vanishing from this England; conviction and veracity giving
place to hollow cant and formalism--antique 'Reign of God,' which all true men in their several
dialects and modes have always striven for, giving place to the
modern reign of the No-God, whom men name devil; this, in its
multitudinous meanings and results, is a sight to create reflections
in the earnest man!

This is an atom: 
One wishes there were a history of English Puritanism, _the last of all our heroisms_, but
sees small prospect of such a thing at present."
Then, beginning to quote himself, as his manner is, changing his
voice and adopting another key, as if by this thin disguise to
obtain somewhat more license for the wildness and vehemence of his
speech--an artifice surely not necessary here--he thus continues:--

This is an atom: 
"'Few nobler heroisms,' says a well-known writer, long occupied on
this subject, 'at bottom, perhaps, _no nobler heroism_, ever
transacted itself on this earth; and it lies as good as lost to us,
overwhelmed under such an avalanche of human stupidities as no
heroism before ever did.

This is an atom: 
Intrinsically and extrinsically it may be considered inaccessible to these generations.
Intrinsically, the spiritual purport of it has become inconceivable,
incredible to the modern mind.

This is an atom: 
Extrinsically, the documents and records of it, scattered waste as a shoreless chaos, are not
legible. They lie there printed, written, to the extent of tons of square miles, as
shot-rubbish; unedited, unsorted, not so much as indexed; full of
every conceivable confusion; yielding light to very few; yielding
darkness, in several sorts, to very many.' ...

This is an atom: 
"'This, then,' continues our impatient friend, 'is the Elysium we English have provided for
our heroes! The Rushworthian Elysium. Dreariest continent of shot-rubbish the eye ever
saw.
Confusion piled on confusion to your utmost horizon's edge; obscure
in lurid twilight as of the shadow of death; trackless, without
index, without finger-post, or mark of any human foregoer; where
your human footstep, if you are still human, echoes bodeful through
the gaunt solitude, peopled only by somnambulant pedants, dilettants,
and doleful creatures, by phantasms, errors, inconceivabilities,
by nightmares, pasteboard norroys, griffins, wiverns, and chimeras
dire!

This is an atom: 
There, all vanquished, overwhelmed under such waste lumber mountains, the wreck and dead ashes of some
six unbelieving generations, does the age of Cromwell and his Puritans lie hidden from us.
This is what we, for our share, have been able to accomplish towards
keeping _our heroic ones_ in memory.'"

This is an atom: 
After some further diatribe against all preceding historians,
collectors, and editors, he drops his ventriloquism, and, resuming
a somewhat more natural voice, he proceeds:--
"Nay, in addition to the sad state of our historical books, and
what indeed is fundamentally the cause and origin of that, our
common spiritual notions, if any notion of ours may still deserve
to be called spiritual, are fatal to a right understanding of that
seventeenth century.

This is an atom: 
_The Christian doctrines, which then dwelt alive in every heart, have now in a manner died
out of all hearts_--very mournful to behold--and are not the guidance of this world any more.

This is an atom: 
Nay, worse still, the cant of them does yet dwell alive with us, little doubting that it is
cant, in which fatal intermediate state the eternal sacredness of
this universe itself, of this human life itself, has fallen dark
to the most of us, and we think that, too, a cant and a creed."

This is an atom: 
So!--as our honest German friend would exclaim, puffing from his mouth at the same time a
huge volume of symbolic smoke.

This is an atom: 
We have withdrawn it seems, from the path of light ever since the reign of the army and its godly
officers established A.D. 1649. We must return and connect ourselves therewith; it is our only
salvation; though, indeed, if Puritanism was the manifestation of
the ideas of all preceding centuries--if the same current of thought
can be traced from William the Conqueror to Oliver the conqueror--a
very little ingenuity would suffice to trace the same ideas, the
same current of thought, somewhat farther still.

This is an atom: 
But this reign of the puritanical army was really "the last glimpse
of the godlike!"

This is an atom: 
--it was "the reign of God!" and we live under the reign of ----, psha! Why, he does not even
give us a substantial devil, but coins a strange personification of a negative. Such was not
the devil, by the way, at the time of "the noblest heroism ever
transacted on the earth."

This is an atom: 
Such a definition of the "roaring lion," would, in those days of
light and happiness, have procured its author, at the very least,
a trip to Barbadoes.

This is an atom: 
Even Cromwell himself would have _Barbadoesed_ him.

This is an atom: 
"This last of our heroisms!" God grant it is the last! It is only out of another religious war that
another such heroism can arise.

This is an atom: 
If church and dissent should take up arms, and, instead of controversies carried on in pamphlets,
upon tradition and white surplices, should blow out each other's brains with gunpowder, then
Mr Carlyle would see his "heroic ones" revive upon the earth.

This is an atom: 
"The Christian doctrines which then dwelt alive in every heart, have now in a manner died out
of all hearts." Only the cant of them dwells alive with us.

This is an atom: 
The same clear-sighted author, who sees the Christian doctrines so beautifully and pre-eminently
developed in the Ironsides of Cromwell, in the troopers of Lambert and Harrison, sacking,
pillaging, slaughtering, and in all that tribe of men who ever shed blood the readier after
prayer-time--men who had dropped from their memory Christ's own preaching, to fill their mouths
with the curses which the Hebrew prophets had been permitted, under
a past dispensation, to denounce against the enemies of Judea, who
had constructed their theology out of the darkest parts of the New,
and the most fearful portion of the Old Testament;--this same author,
opening his eyes and ears upon his own day and generation, finds
that Christianity has died out of all hearts, and its phraseology,
as he expresses himself elsewhere, "become mournful to him when
spouted as frothy cant from Exeter Hall."

This is an atom: 
If Mr Carlyle would visit Exeter Hall, and carry there one tithe of the determination to
approve, that he exhibits in favour of the Puritan, he would find a Christian piety as sincere,
as genuine, and far more humane, than his heroes of Naseby, or Dunbar, or Drogheda were acquainted
with. He would see the descendants of his Puritans, relieved, at least we may say, from the
necessity of raising their psalm on the battle-field, indulging in none of the ferocities
of our nature, assembling in numerous but peaceful meetings, raising
annually, by a quiet but no contemptible sacrifice, their millions
for the dissemination of Gospel truth.

This is an atom: 
But Mr Carlyle would call this cant; he sees nothing good, or generous, or high-minded in any
portion of the world in which he lives; he reserves his sympathies for the past--for the men
of buckram and broad-sword, who, on a question of church government, were always ready "to
hew Agag to pieces," let Agag stand for who, or what number it might.

This is an atom: 
If there is one spectacle more odious than another of all which history presents to us, whether
it take place amongst Mahometan or Christian, Catholic or Protestant, it is this:--to see men
practising all the terrible brutalities of war, treading down their enemies, doing all that rage
and the worst passions prompt, and doing all amidst exclamations of piety, devout acknowledgments
of submission to Divine will, and professions of gratitude to God. Other religious factions
have committed far greater atrocities than the Puritans, but nowhere in history is this same
spectacle exhibited with more distasteful and sickening accompaniments. The Moslem thanked God
upon his sword in at least a somewhat soldierly manner; and the
Catholic, by the very pomp with which he chants his _Te Deum_,
somewhat conceals the meaning of his act, and, keeping God a little
out of sight, makes his mass express the natural feeling of a human
triumph.

This is an atom: 
But the sleek Puritan, at once grovelling and presumptuous, mingles with his sanguinary mood
all the morbid sickly conceit, all the crawling affected humility of the conventicle. All
his bloodsheds are "mercies," and they are granted in answer to his long and miserable
prayers--prayers which, to a man of rational piety, sound very much like blasphemies. He
carries with him to the battle-field, to the siege, to the massacre,
not one even of those generous feelings which war itself permits
towards a foe.

This is an atom: 
He chooses to call his enemy the enemy of God, and kneels before he fights, that the
inexpressible _mercy_ may be granted of cutting his throat!

This is an atom: 
"That the sense of difference between right and wrong," says Mr
Carlyle, "had filled all time and all space for man, and bodied
itself forth into a heaven and hell for him,--this constitutes the
grand feature of those Puritan, old-Christian ages; this is the
element which stamps them as heroic, and has rendered their works
great, manlike, fruitful to all generations."

This is an atom: 
Quite on the contrary. The sense of right and wrong was obscured, confused, lost sight of, in
the promptings of a presumptuous enthusiasm; and it is exactly _this_ which constitutes the perilous
characteristic of such men as the Puritans and Cameronians, and
similar sectaries.

This is an atom: 
How can the sense of right and wrong keep its footing in an enthusiasm which has brought itself
to believe that all its successes are a direct answer to its
prayers?

This is an atom: 
Success becomes the very measure of right and wrong. The two extremes of Atheism and Fanaticism
have met; they may both dispense with conscience, and make the event the criterion of the deed.
Hear how the pious heroes of Mr Carlyle reason on one of the most
solemn occasions of the civil war.

This is an atom: 
The army is remonstrating with the Parliament because it appeared slow to shed the blood of their
conquered and captured King, and it actually speaks of the death of Charles "as appeasing the
wrath of God" against that sovereign! and bids the Parliament "sadly to consider, as men
accountable to the Highest," how far an accommodation with the
King, "when God hath given him so clearly into your power to do
justice, can be just before God or good men."

This is an atom: 
The _power_ to do the act is full authority, is absolute command to do it. What other doctrine
could a CÃ¦sar Borgia, or an Eccelino, the tyrant of Padua, desire to be governed, or rather
to be manumitted by from all government?

This is an atom: 
The argument drawn from the success given to their cause, is perpetually in the mouth of Cromwell
and of his Puritans. It establishes, without a doubt, that they have used the sword justly,
and are still further to use it. Every "mercy" of this kind is in answer to prayer. Basing-House,
a private residence, cannot be sacked and plundered, and the inhabitants put to the sword,
but the pious historian of the feat, Mr Peters, adds, that it, and the like triumphs, were
"answers to the prayers and trophies of the faith of some of God's servants." When Greek
meets Greek, when the Scottish Covenanter encounters the English Puritan, and the former, being
worsted, finds out "that he had not so learned Christ as to hang the equity of a cause upon
events," Cromwell answers, "Did not you solemnly appeal and pray? Did not we do so too? And
ought not you and we to think, with fear and trembling, of the hand of the Great God, in
this mighty and strange appearance of His, instead of slightly calling it an 'event'? Were
not both your and our expectations renewed from time to time, whilst we waited upon God,
to see which way He would manifest himself upon our appeals? And shall we, after all these
our prayers, fastings, tears, expectations, and solemn appeals, call these bare 'events'? The
Lord pity you."

This is an atom: 
Men prayed in those days! says Mr Carlyle, "actually prayed! It was a capability old London
and its preachers and populations had; to us the incredibilest." Beyond a doubt the Puritans
and the Covenanters prayed, and in such a manner and at such a length, that the strange doctrine
on which Southey has founded his "Curse of Kehama," of the essential and irresistible force of prayer,
seems to have got mixed up with their Christianity.[2] But we do
not think that the voice of prayer has quite died out amongst us.

This is an atom: 
It is curious to observe what a vivid perception this author has
for the historical past, and what a voluntary blindness and deafness
for the actually present.

This is an atom: 
It is a fact! he frequently exclaims, with all the energy of a discoverer,--a fact! that men
in these ages prayed, and had a religious faith. Our churches and
chapels are not facts.

This is an atom: 
The control--none the worse for being exercised without pike or musket--which the religious
public, meeting in that very Exeter Hall, have over the measures of government, and all
political transactions,--is not a fact. Were he writing, some centuries hence, the history
of this our age, he would detect these facts. What facts, indeed, might he not detect, and what
exaggerated significance might he not give to them!

This is an atom: 
Why, in those days, he might exclaim, in his enthusiasm, the very beggars in the street, in
asking charity, poured God's blessing on you! It was a credible thing, in those days, God's
blessing!--and men gave their money for it!

This is an atom: 
A passage in one of Cromwell's letters instances, in rather a touching manner, what school of
piety this army of saints must have proved. At the battle of Marston Moor a Colonel Walton
had lost his son. "He was a gallant young man, exceedingly gracious," and Cromwell, giving an
account of his death, in his consolatory letter to the father,
writes thus,--"A little after, he said, one thing lay upon his
spirit.

This is an atom: 
I asked him what that was. He told me it was that God had not suffered him to be any more _the
executioner of his enemies!_"

This is an atom: 
But nothing disturbs the equanimity of our editor, or interrupts
his flow of rapture over the fanaticism of these times, especially
when expressed in the letters of Cromwell.

This is an atom: 
Over the theological effusions which the general of the Puritan army addresses, from his camp,
to the Edinburgh clergy, Mr Carlyle thus expatiates:--"Dryasdust,
carrying his learned eye over these, and the like letters, finds
them, of course, full of 'hypocrisy,' &c.

This is an atom: 
Unfortunate Dryasdust!

This is an atom: 
they are corruscations terrible as lightning, and beautiful as lightning, from the innermost temple
of the human soul; intimations, still credible, of what a human
soul does mean when it _believes_ in the Highest--a thing poor
Dryasdust never did, nor will do.

This is an atom: 
The hapless generation that now reads
      these words ought to hold
   its peace when it has read
      them, and sink into
   unutterable reflections, not
   unmixed with tears, and some substitute
   for 'sackcloth and ashes,' if it
   liked.

This is an atom: 
In its poor canting, sniffling, flimsy vocabulary, there is no word
that can make any response to them.

This is an atom: 
This man has a living God-inspired soul in him, not an enchanted
artificial 'substitute for salt,' as our fashion is.

This is an atom: 
They that have human eyes can look at him; they that have only owl-eyes need not."
And then follows something upon _light_ and _lightning_. "As lightning is to light, so is a
Cromwell to a Shakspere. The light is beautifuller.

This is an atom: 
Ah, yes; but, until by lightning and other fierce labour your foul chaos has become a world,
you cannot have any light, or the smallest chance for any!...

This is an atom: 
The melodious speaker is great, but the melodious worker is greater than he. Our Time cannot
speak at all, but only cant and sneer, and argumentatively jargon and recite the multiplication-table:
neither, as yet, can it work, except at mere railroads and cotton-spinning.
It will, apparently, return to chaos soon, and then more lightnings will be needed, lightning
enough,--to which Cromwell's was but a mild matter,--to be followed
by light, we may hope!"

This is an atom: 
--by another Shakspeare, as the tenor of the passage would imply.

This is an atom: 
Strange jumble this of Cromwell and Shakspeare, of light and lightning! There is one species
of light which we are often reminded of here; a certain fitful, flickering beam, which partakes
indeed of a luminous nature, but which chooses its path for ever
over bottomless bog.

This is an atom: 
The sincerity of Oliver Cromwell, in these his letters and speeches, has been questioned and
discussed; the sincerity of their present editor may become a
question at least as difficult and perplexing.

This is an atom: 
Is there any genuine conviction at the bottom of all this rant and raving?
Our extravagant worshipper of the "old heathen" GoÃ«the, stands forth
the champion and admirer of certain harsh, narrow-thoughted, impetuous
sectaries, proclaims _them_ the only "Reformers" of the world;
descends to their lowest prejudices, to their saddest bigotries,
to their gloomy puerilities; arguing with them solemnly against the
sinfulness of drinking healths, and quite fraternising with them
in all their animosity against Popery and Prelacy.

This is an atom: 
What does he mean?
Is it a case of conversion?

This is an atom: 
Is it an outpouring merely, by a strange vent, of certain acrid humours? Is he honest, and in earnest? or
is he making sport of those hapless Englishmen whom he pronounces "in human stupidity to
have no fellow?"

This is an atom: 
Luckily for her, the only answers required for some time were mono-syllables; but those few
words were uttered in so depressed and mournful a tone, that at last they struck Mr Bellingham
with surprise and displeasure, as the condition of mind they unconsciously implied did not
harmonise with his own.

This is an atom: 
"Ruth, what is the matter this morning? You really are very provoking. Yesterday, when everything
was gloomy, and you might have been aware that I was out of spirits, I heard nothing but expressions
of delight; to-day, when every creature under heaven is rejoicing, you look most deplorable
and woe-begone. You really should learn to have a little sympathy."

This is an atom: 
The tears fell quickly down Ruth's cheeks, but she did not speak. She could not put into words
the sense she was just beginning to entertain of the estimation in which she was henceforward
to be held. She thought he would be as much grieved as she was at what had taken place that
morning; she fancied she should sink in his opinion if she told him how others regarded her;
besides, it seemed ungenerous to dilate upon the suffering of which he was the cause.

This is an atom: 
"I will not," thought she, "embitter his life; I will try and be cheerful. I must not think
of myself so much. If I can but make him happy, what need I care for chance speeches?"

This is an atom: 
Accordingly, she made every effort possible to be as light-hearted as he was; but, somehow,
the moment she relaxed, thoughts would intrude, and wonders would force themselves upon her
mind; so that altogether she was not the gay and bewitching companion Mr Bellingham had previously
found her.

This is an atom: 
They sauntered out for a walk. The path they chose led to a wood on the side of a hill, and
they entered, glad of the shade of the trees. At first, it appeared like any common grove,
but they soon came to a deep descent, on the summit of which they stood, looking down on the
tree-tops, which were softly waving far beneath their feet. There was a path leading sharp
down, and they followed it; the ledge of rock made it almost like going down steps, and their
walk grew into a bounding, and their bounding into a run, before they reached the lowest plane.
A green gloom reigned there; it was the still hour of noon; the little birds were quiet in
some leafy shade. They went on a few yards, and then they came to a circular pool overshadowed
by the trees, whose highest boughs had been beneath their feet a few minutes before. The pond
was hardly below the surface of the ground, and there was nothing like a bank on any side.
A heron was standing there motionless, but when he saw them he flapped his wings and slowly
rose, and soared above the green heights of the wood up into the very sky itself, for at that
depth the trees appeared to touch the round white clouds which brooded over the earth. The
speed-well grew in the shallowest water of the pool, and all around its margin, but the flowers
were hardly seen at first, so deep was the green shadow cast by the trees. In the very middle
of the pond the sky was mirrored clear and dark, a blue which looked as if a black void lay behind.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, there are water-lilies," said Ruth, her eye catching on the farther side. "I must go and
get some."

This is an atom: 
"No; I will get them for you. The ground is spongy all round there. Sit still, Ruth; this heap
of grass will make a capital seat."

This is an atom: 
He went round, and she waited quietly for his return. When he came back he took off her bonnet,
without speaking, and began to place his flowers in her hair. She was quite still while he
arranged her coronet, looking up in his face with loving eyes, with a peaceful composure. She
knew that he was pleased from his manner, which had the joyousness of a child playing with
a new toy, and she did not think twice of his occupation. It was pleasant to forget everything
except his pleasure. When he had decked her out, he said:

This is an atom: 
"There, Ruth! now you'll do. Come and look at yourself in the pond. Here, where there are no
weeds. Come."

This is an atom: 
She obeyed, and could not help seeing her own loveliness; it gave her a sense of satisfaction
for an instant, as the sight of any other beautiful object would have done, but she never thought
of associating it with herself. She knew that she was beautiful; but that seemed abstract,
and removed from herself. Her existence was in feeling, and thinking, and loving.

This is an atom: 
Down in that green hollow they were quite in harmony. Her beauty was all that Mr Bellingham
cared for, and it was supreme. It was all he recognised of her, and he was proud of it. She
stood in her white dress against the trees which grew around; her face was flushed into a brilliancy
of colour which resembled that of a rose in June; the great heavy white flowers drooped on
either side of her beautiful head, and if her brown hair was a little disordered, the very
disorder only seemed to add a grace. She pleased him more by looking so lovely than by all
her tender endeavours to fall in with his varying humour.

This is an atom: 
But when they left the wood, and Ruth had taken out her flowers, and resumed her bonnet, as
they came near the inn, the simple thought of giving him pleasure was not enough to secure
Ruth's peace. She became pensive and sad, and could not rally into gaiety.

This is an atom: 
"Really, Ruth," said he, that evening, "you must not encourage yourself in this habit of falling
into melancholy reveries without any cause. You have been sighing twenty times during the last
half-hour. Do be a little cheerful. Remember, I have no companion but you in this out-of-the-way
place."

This is an atom: 
"I am very sorry, sir," said Ruth, her eyes filling with tears; and then she remembered that
it was very dull for him to be alone with her, heavy-hearted as she had been all day. She said
in a sweet, penitent tone:

This is an atom: 
"Would you be so kind as to teach me one of those games at cards you were speaking about yesterday,
sir? I would do my best to learn."

This is an atom: 
Her soft, murmuring voice won its way. They rang for the cards, and he soon forgot that there
was such a thing as depression or gloom in the world, in the pleasure of teaching such a beautiful
ignoramus the mysteries of card-playing.

This is an atom: 
"There!" said he, at last, "that's enough for one lesson. Do you know, little goose, your blunders
have made me laugh myself into one of the worst headaches I have had for years."

This is an atom: 
He threw himself on the sofa, and in an instant she was by his side.

This is an atom: 
"Let me put my cool hands on your forehead," she begged; "that used to do mamma good."

This is an atom: 
He lay still, his face away from the light, and not speaking. Presently he fell asleep. Ruth
put out the candles, and sat patiently by him for a long time, fancying he would awaken refreshed.
The room grew cool in the night air; but Ruth dared not rouse him from what appeared to be
sound, restoring slumber. She covered him with her shawl, which she had thrown over a chair
on coming in from their twilight ramble. She had ample time to think; but she tried to banish
thought. At last, his breathing became quick and oppressed, and, after listening to it for
some minutes with increasing affright, Ruth ventured to waken him. He seemed stupified and
shivery. Ruth became more and more terrified; all the household were asleep except one servant-girl,
who was wearied out of what little English she had knowledge of in more waking hours, and she
could only answer, "Iss, indeed, ma'am," to any question put to her by Ruth.

This is an atom: 
She sat by the bedside all night long. He moaned and tossed, but never spoke sensibly. It was
a new form of illness to the miserable Ruth. Her yesterday's suffering went into the black
distance of long-past years. The present was all-in-all. When she heard people stirring, she
went in search of Mrs Morgan, whose shrewd, sharp manners, unsoftened by inward respect for
the poor girl, had awed Ruth even when Mr Bellingham was by to protect her.

This is an atom: 
"Mrs Morgan," said she, sitting down in the little parlour appropriated to the landlady, for
she felt her strength suddenly desert her--"Mrs Morgan, I'm afraid Mr Bellingham is very ill;"--here
she burst into tears, but instantly checking herself, "Oh, what must I do?" continued she;
"I don't think he has known anything all through the night, and he looks so strange and wild
this morning."

This is an atom: 
She gazed up into Mrs Morgan's face, as if reading an oracle.

This is an atom: 
"Indeed, miss, ma'am, and it's a very awkward thing. But don't cry, that can do no good, 'deed
it can't. I'll go and see the poor young man myself, and then I can judge if a doctor is wanting."

This is an atom: 
Ruth followed Mrs Morgan upstairs. When they entered the sick-room Mr Bellingham was sitting
up in bed, looking wildly about him, and as he saw them, he exclaimed:

This is an atom: 
"Ruth! Ruth! come here; I won't be left alone!" and then he fell down exhausted on the pillow.
Mrs Morgan went up and spoke to him, but he did not answer or take any notice.

This is an atom: 
"I'll send for Mr Jones, my dear, 'deed and I will; we'll have him here in a couple of hours,
please God."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, can't he come sooner?" asked Ruth, wild with terror.

This is an atom: 
"'Deed no; he lives at LlanglÃ¢s when he's at home, and that's seven mile away, and he may be
gone a round eight or nine mile on the other side LlanglÃ¢s; but I'll send a boy on the pony
directly."

This is an atom: 
Saying this, Mrs Morgan left Ruth alone. There was nothing to be done, for Mr Bellingham had
again fallen into a heavy sleep. Sounds of daily life began, bells rang, breakfast-services
clattered up and down the passages, and Ruth sat on shivering by the bedside in that darkened
room. Mrs Morgan sent her breakfast upstairs by a chambermaid, but Ruth motioned it away in
her sick agony, and the girl had no right to urge her to partake of it. That alone broke the
monotony of the long morning. She heard the sound of merry parties setting out on excursions,
on horseback or in carriages; and once, stiff and wearied, she stole to the window, and looked
out on one side of the blind; but the day looked bright and discordant to her aching, anxious
heart. The gloom of the darkened room was better and more befitting.

This is an atom: 
It was some hours after he was summoned before the doctor made his appearance. He questioned
his patient, and, receiving no coherent answers, he asked Ruth concerning the symptoms; but
when she questioned him in turn he only shook his head and looked grave. He made a sign to
Mrs Morgan to follow him out of the room, and they went down to her parlour, leaving Ruth in
a depth of despair, lower than she could have thought it possible there remained for her to
experience, an hour before.

This is an atom: 
"I am afraid this is a bad case," said Mr Jones to Mrs Morgan in Welsh. "A brain-fever has
evidently set in."

This is an atom: 
"Poor young gentleman! poor young man! He looked the very picture of health!"

This is an atom: 
"That very appearance of robustness will, in all probability, make his disorder more violent.
However, we must hope for the best, Mrs Morgan. Who is to attend upon him? He will require
careful nursing. Is that young lady his sister? She looks too young to be his wife?"

This is an atom: 
"No, indeed! Gentlemen like you must know, Mr Jones, that we can't always look too closely
into the ways of young men who come to our houses. Not but what I'm sorry for her, for she's
an innocent, inoffensive young creature. I always think it right, for my own morals, to put
a little scorn into my manners when such as her come to stay here; but, indeed, she's so gentle,
I've found it hard work to show the proper contempt."

This is an atom: 
She would have gone on to her inattentive listener if she had not heard a low tap at the door,
which recalled her from her morality, and Mr Jones from his consideration of the necessary
prescriptions.

This is an atom: 
"Come in!" said Mrs Morgan, sharply. And Ruth came in. She was white and trembling; but she
stood in that dignity which strong feeling, kept down by self-command, always imparts.

This is an atom: 
"I wish you, sir, to be so kind as to tell me, clearly and distinctly, what I must do for Mr
Bellingham. Every direction you give me shall be most carefully attended to. You spoke about
leeches--I can put them on, and see about them. Tell me everything, sir, that you wish to have
done!"

This is an atom: 
Her manner was calm and serious, and her countenance and deportment showed that the occasion
was calling out strength sufficient to meet it. Mr Jones spoke with a deference which he had
not thought of using upstairs, even while he supposed her to be the sister of the invalid.
Ruth listened gravely; she repeated some of the injunctions, in order that she might be sure
that she fully comprehended them, and then, bowing, left the room.

This is an atom: 
"She is no common person," said Mr Jones. "Still she is too young to have the responsibility
of such a serious case. Have you any idea where his friends live, Mrs Morgan?"

This is an atom: 
"Indeed and I have. His mother, as haughty a lady as you would wish to see, came travelling
through Wales last year; she stopped here, and, I warrant you, nothing was good enough for
her; she was real quality. She left some clothes and books behind her (for the maid was almost
as fine as the mistress, and little thought of seeing after her lady's clothes, having a taste
for going to see scenery along with the man-servant), and we had several letters from her.
I have them locked in the drawers in the bar, where I keep such things."

This is an atom: 
"Well! I should recommend your writing to the lady, and telling her her son's state."

This is an atom: 
"It would be a favour, Mr Jones, if you would just write it yourself. English writing comes
so strange to my pen."

This is an atom: 
The letter was written, and, in order to save time, Mr Jones took it to the LlanglÃ¢s post-office.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VII

This is an atom: 
The Crisis--Watching and Waiting

This is an atom: 
Ruth put away every thought of the past or future; everything that could unfit her for the
duties of the present. Exceeding love supplied the place of experience. She never left the
room after the first day; she forced herself to eat, because his service needed her strength.
She did not indulge in any tears, because the weeping she longed for would make her less able
to attend upon him. She watched, and waited, and prayed: prayed with an utter forgetfulness
of self, only with a consciousness that God was all-powerful, and that he, whom she loved so
much, needed the aid of the Mighty One.

This is an atom: 
Day and night, the summer night, seemed merged into one. She lost count of time in the hushed
and darkened room. One morning Mrs Morgan beckoned her out; and she stole on tiptoe into the
dazzling gallery, on one side of which the bedrooms opened.

This is an atom: 
"She's come," whispered Mrs Morgan, looking very much excited, and forgetting that Ruth had
never heard that Mrs Bellingham had been summoned.

This is an atom: 
"Who is come?" asked Ruth. The idea of Mrs Mason flashed through her mind--but with a more
terrible, because a more vague dread, she heard that it was his mother; the mother of whom
he had always spoken as a person whose opinion was to be regarded more than that of any other
individual.

This is an atom: 
"What must I do? Will she be angry with me?" said she, relapsing into her child-like dependence
on others; and feeling that even Mrs Morgan was some one to stand between her and Mrs Bellingham.

This is an atom: 
Mrs Morgan herself was a little perplexed. Her morality was rather shocked at the idea of a
proper real lady like Mrs Bellingham discovering that she had winked at the connexion between
her son and Ruth. She was quite inclined to encourage Ruth in her inclination to shrink out
of Mrs Bellingham's observation, an inclination which arose from no definite consciousness
of having done wrong, but principally from the representations she had always heard of the
lady's awfulness. Mrs Bellingham swept into her son's room as if she were unconscious what
poor young creature had lately haunted it; while Ruth hurried into some unoccupied bedroom,
and, alone there, she felt her self-restraint suddenly give way, and burst into the saddest,
most utterly wretched weeping she had ever known. She was worn out with watching, and exhausted
by passionate crying, and she lay down on the bed and fell asleep. The day passed on; she slumbered
unnoticed and unregarded; she awoke late in the evening with a sense of having done wrong in
sleeping so long; the strain upon her responsibility had not yet left her. Twilight was closing
fast around; she waited until it had become night, and then she stole down to Mrs Morgan's parlour.

This is an atom: 
"If you please, may I come in?" asked she.

This is an atom: 
Jenny Morgan was doing up the hieroglyphics which she called her accounts; she answered sharply
enough, but it was a permission to enter, and Ruth was thankful for it.

This is an atom: 
"Will you tell me how he is? Do you think I may go back to him?"

This is an atom: 
"No, indeed, that you may not. Nest, who has made his room tidy these many days, is not fit
to go in now. Mrs Bellingham has brought her own maid, and the family nurse, and Mr Bellingham's
man; such a tribe of servants and no end to packages; water-beds coming by the carrier, and
a doctor from London coming down to-morrow, as if feather-beds and Mr Jones was not good enough.
Why, she won't let a soul of us into the room; there's no chance for you!"

This is an atom: 
Ruth sighed. "How is he?" she inquired, after a pause.

This is an atom: 
"How can I tell indeed, when I'm not allowed to go near him? Mr Jones said to-night was a turning
point; but I doubt it, for it is four days since he was taken ill, and who ever heard of a
sick person taking a turn on an even number of days; it's always on the third, or the fifth,
or seventh, or so on. He'll not turn till to-morrow night, take my word for it, and their fine
London doctor will get all the credit, and honest Mr Jones will be thrown aside. I don't think
he will get better myself, though--Gelert does not howl for nothing. My patience! what's the
matter with the girl?--lord, child, you're never going to faint, and be ill on my hands?" Her
sharp voice recalled Ruth from the sick unconsciousness that had been creeping over her as
she listened to the latter part of this speech. She sat down and could not speak--the room
whirled round and round--her white feebleness touched Mrs Morgan's heart.

This is an atom: 
"You've had no tea, I guess. Indeed, and the girls are very careless." She rang the bell with
energy, and seconded her pull by going to the door and shouting out sharp directions, in Welsh,
to Nest and Gwen, and three or four other rough, kind, slatternly servants.

This is an atom: 
They brought her tea, which was comfortable, according to the idea of comfort prevalent in
that rude, hospitable place; there was plenty to eat, too much, indeed, for it revolted the
appetite it was intended to provoke. But the heartiness with which the kind, rosy waiter pressed
her to eat, and the scolding Mrs Morgan gave her when she found the buttered toast untouched
(toast on which she had herself desired that the butter might not be spared), did Ruth more
good than the tea. She began to hope, and to long for the morning when hope might have become
certainty. It was all in vain that she was told that the room she had been in all day was at
her service; she did not say a word, but she was not going to bed that night, of all nights
in the year, when life or death hung trembling in the balance. She went into the bedroom till
the bustling house was still, and heard busy feet passing to and fro in the room she might
not enter; and voices, imperious, though hushed down to a whisper, ask for innumerable things.
Then there was silence; and when she thought that all were dead asleep, except the watchers,
she stole out into the gallery. On the other side were two windows, cut into the thick stone
wall, and flower pots were placed on the shelves thus formed, where great, untrimmed, straggling
geraniums grew, and strove to reach the light. The window near Mr Bellingham's door was open;
the soft, warm-scented night air came sighing in in faint gusts, and then was still. It was
summer; there was no black darkness in the twenty-four hours; only the light grew dusky, and
colour disappeared from objects, of which the shape and form remained distinct. A soft grey
oblong of barred light fell on the flat wall opposite to the windows, and deeper grey shadows
marked out the tracery of the plants, more graceful thus than in reality. Ruth crouched where
no light fell. She sat on the ground close by the door; her whole existence was absorbed in
listening; all was still; it was only her heart beating with the strong, heavy, regular sound
of a hammer. She wished she could stop its rushing, incessant clang. She heard a rustle of
a silken gown, and knew it ought not to have been worn in a sick-room; for her senses seemed
to have passed into the keeping of the invalid, and to feel only as he felt. The noise was
probably occasioned by some change of posture in the watcher inside, for it was once more dead-still.
The soft wind outside sank with a low, long, distant moan among the windings of the hills,
and lost itself there, and came no more again. But Ruth's heart beat loud. She rose with as
little noise as if she were a vision, and crept to the open window to try and lose the nervous
listening for the ever-recurring sound. Out beyond, under the calm sky, veiled with a mist
rather than with a cloud, rose the high, dark outlines of the mountains, shutting in that village
as if it lay in a nest. They stood, like giants, solemnly watching for the end of Earth and
Time. Here and there a black round shadow reminded Ruth of some "Cwm," or hollow, where she
and her lover had rambled in sun and in gladness. She then thought the land enchanted into
everlasting brightness and happiness; she fancied, then, that into a region so lovely no bale
or woe could enter, but would be charmed away and disappear before the sight of the glorious
guardian mountains. Now she knew the truth, that earth has no barrier which avails against
agony. It comes lightning-like down from heaven, into the mountain house and the town garret;
into the palace and into the cottage. The garden lay close under the house; a bright spot enough
by day; for in that soil, whatever was planted grew and blossomed in spite of neglect. The
white roses glimmered out in the dusk all the night through; the red were lost in shadow. Between
the low boundary of the garden and the hills swept one or two green meadows; Ruth looked into
the grey darkness till she traced each separate wave of outline. Then she heard a little restless
bird chirp out its wakefulness from a nest in the ivy round the walls of the house. But the
mother-bird spread her soft feathers, and hushed it into silence. Presently, however, many
little birds began to scent the coming dawn, and rustled among the leaves, and chirruped loud
and clear. Just above the horizon, too, the mist became a silvery grey cloud hanging on the
edge of the world; presently it turned shimmering white; and then, in an instant, it flushed
into rose, and the mountain-tops sprang into heaven, and bathed in the presence of the shadow
of God. With a bound, the sun of a molten fiery red came above the horizon, and immediately
thousands of little birds sang out for joy, and a soft chorus of mysterious, glad murmurs came
forth from the earth; the low whispering wind left its hiding-place among the clefts and hollows
of the hills, and wandered among the rustling herbs and trees, waking the flower-buds to the
life of another day. Ruth gave a sigh of relief that the night was over and gone; for she knew
that soon suspense would be ended, and the verdict known, whether for life or for death. She
grew faint and sick with anxiety; it almost seemed as if she must go into the room and learn
the truth. Then she heard movements, but they were not sharp or rapid, as if prompted by any
emergency; then, again, it was still. She sat curled up upon the floor, with her head thrown
back against the wall, and her hands clasped round her knees. She had yet to wait. Meanwhile,
the invalid was slowly rousing himself from a long, deep, sound, health-giving sleep. His mother
had sat by him the night through, and was now daring to change her position for the first time;
she was even venturing to give directions in a low voice to the old nurse, who had dozed away
in an arm-chair, ready to obey any summons of her mistress. Mrs Bellingham went on tiptoe towards
the door, and chiding herself because her stiff, weary limbs made some slight noise. She had
an irrepressible longing for a few minutes' change of scene after her night of watching. She
felt that the crisis was over; and the relief to her mind made her conscious of every bodily
feeling and irritation, which had passed unheeded as long as she had been in suspense.

This is an atom: 
She slowly opened the door. Ruth sprang upright at the first sound of the creaking handle.
Her very lips were stiff and unpliable with the force of the blood which rushed to her head.
It seemed as if she could not form words. She stood right before Mrs Bellingham. "How is he,
madam?"

This is an atom: 
Mrs Bellingham was for a moment surprised at the white apparition which seemed to rise out
of the ground. But her quick, proud mind understood it all in an instant. This was the girl,
then, whose profligacy had led her son astray; had raised up barriers in the way of her favourite
scheme of his marriage with Miss Duncombe; nay, this was the real cause of his illness, his
mortal danger at this present time, and of her bitter, keen anxiety. If, under any circumstances,
Mrs Bellingham could have been guilty of the ill-breeding of not answering a question, it was
now; and for a moment she was tempted to pass on in silence. Ruth could not wait; she spoke again:

This is an atom: 
"For the love of God, madam, speak! How is he? Will he live?"

This is an atom: 
If she did not answer her, she thought the creature was desperate enough to force her way into
his room. So she spoke.

This is an atom: 
"He has slept well: he is better."

This is an atom: 
"Oh! my God, I thank Thee," murmured Ruth, sinking back against the wall.

This is an atom: 
It was too much to hear this wretched girl thanking God for her son's life; as if, in fact,
she had any lot or part in him, and to dare to speak to the Almighty on her son's behalf! Mrs
Bellingham looked at her with cold, contemptuous eyes, whose glances were like ice-bolts, and
made Ruth shiver up away from them.

This is an atom: 
"Young woman, if you have any propriety or decency left, I trust that you will not dare to
force yourself into his room."

This is an atom: 
She stood for a moment as if awaiting an answer, and half expecting it to be a defiance. But
she did not understand Ruth. She did not imagine the faithful trustfulness of her heart. Ruth
believed that if Mr Bellingham was alive and likely to live, all was well. When he wanted her,
he would send for her, ask for her, yearn for her, till every one would yield before his steadfast
will. At present she imagined that he was probably too weak to care or know who was about him;
and though it would have been an infinite delight to her to hover and brood around him, yet
it was of him she thought and not of herself. She gently drew herself on one side to make way
for Mrs Bellingham to pass.

This is an atom: 
By-and-by Mrs Morgan came up. Ruth was still near the door, from which it seemed as if she
could not tear herself away.

This is an atom: 
"Indeed, miss, and you must not hang about the door in this way; it is not pretty manners.
Mrs Bellingham has been speaking very sharp and cross about it, and I shall lose the character
of my inn if people take to talking as she does. Did not I give you a room last night to keep
in, and never be seen or heard of; and did I not tell you what a particular lady Mrs Bellingham
was, but you must come out here right in her way? Indeed, it was not pretty, nor grateful to
me, Jenny Morgan, and that I must say."

This is an atom: 
Ruth turned away like a chidden child. Mrs Morgan followed her to her room, scolding as she
went; and then, having cleared her heart after her wont by uttering hasty words, her real kindness
made her add, in a softened tone:

This is an atom: 
"You stop up here like a good girl. I'll send you your breakfast by-and-by, and let you know
from time to time how he is; and you can go out for a walk, you know; but if you do, I'll take
it as a favour if you'll go out by the side door. It will, maybe, save scandal."

This is an atom: 
All that day long, Ruth kept herself close prisoner in the room to which Mrs Morgan accorded
her; all that day, and many succeeding days. But at nights, when the house was still, and even
the little brown mice had gathered up the crumbs, and darted again to their holes, Ruth stole
out, and crept to his door to catch, if she could, the sound of his beloved voice. She could
tell by its tones how he felt, and how he was getting on, as well as any of the watchers in
the room. She yearned and pined to see him once more; but she had reasoned herself down into
something like patience. When he was well enough to leave his room, when he had not always
one of the nurses with him, then he would send for her, and she would tell him how very patient
she had been for his dear sake. But it was long to wait even with this thought of the manner
in which the waiting would end. Poor Ruth! her faith was only building up vain castles in the
air; they towered up into heaven, it is true, but, after all, they were but visions.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER VIII

This is an atom: 
Mrs Bellingham "Does the Thing Handsomely"

This is an atom: 
If Mr Bellingham did not get rapidly well, it was more owing to the morbid querulous fancy
attendant on great weakness than from any unfavourable medical symptom. But he turned away
with peevish loathing from the very sight of food, prepared in the slovenly manner which had
almost disgusted him when he was well. It was of no use telling him that Simpson, his mother's
maid, had superintended the preparation at every point. He offended her by detecting something
offensive and to be avoided in her daintiest messes, and made Mrs Morgan mutter many a hasty
speech, which, however, Mrs Bellingham thought it better not to hear until her son should be
strong enough to travel.

This is an atom: 
"I think you are better to-day," said she, as his man wheeled his sofa to the bedroom window.
"We shall get you downstairs to-morrow."

This is an atom: 
"If it were to get away from this abominable place, I could go down to-day; but I believe I'm
to be kept prisoner here for ever. I shall never get well here, I'm sure."

This is an atom: 
He sank back on his sofa in impatient despair. The surgeon was announced, and eagerly questioned
by Mrs Bellingham as to the possibility of her son's removal; and he, having heard the same
anxiety for the same end expressed by Mrs Morgan in the regions below, threw no great obstacles
in the way. After the doctor had taken his departure, Mrs Bellingham cleared her throat several
times. Mr Bellingham knew the prelude of old, and winced with nervous annoyance.

This is an atom: 
"Henry, there is something I must speak to you about; an unpleasant subject, certainly, but
one which has been forced upon me by the very girl herself; you must be aware to what I refer
without giving me the pain of explaining myself."

This is an atom: 
Mr Bellingham turned himself sharply round to the wall, and prepared himself for a lecture
by concealing his face from her notice; but she herself was in too nervous a state to be capable
of observation.

This is an atom: 
"Of course," she continued, "it was my wish to be as blind to the whole affair as possible,
though you can't imagine how Mrs Mason has blazoned it abroad; all Fordham rings with it; but
of course it could not be pleasant, or, indeed, I may say correct, for me to be aware that
a person of such improper character was under the same--I beg your pardon, dear Henry, what
do you say?"

This is an atom: 
"Ruth is no improper character, mother; you do her injustice!"

This is an atom: 
"My dear boy, you don't mean to uphold her as a paragon of virtue!"

This is an atom: 
"No, mother, but I led her wrong; I--"

This is an atom: 
"We will let all discussions into the cause or duration of her present character drop, if you
please," said Mrs Bellingham, with the sort of dignified authority which retained a certain
power over her son--a power which originated in childhood, and which he only defied when he
was roused into passion. He was too weak in body to oppose himself to her, and fight the ground
inch by inch. "As I have implied, I do not wish to ascertain your share of blame; from what
I saw of her one morning, I am convinced of her forward, intrusive manners, utterly without
shame, or even common modesty."

This is an atom: 
"What are you referring to?" asked Mr Bellingham, sharply.

This is an atom: 
"Why, when you were at the worst, and I had been watching you all night, and had just gone
out in the morning for a breath of fresh air, this girl pushed herself before me, and insisted
upon speaking to me. I really had to send Mrs Morgan to her before I could return to your room.
A more impudent, hardened manner, I never saw."

This is an atom: 
"Ruth was neither impudent nor hardened; she was ignorant enough, and might offend from knowing
no better."

This is an atom: 
He was getting weary of the discussion, and wished it had never been begun. From the time he
had become conscious of his mother's presence, he had felt the dilemma he was in in regard
to Ruth, and various plans had directly crossed his brain; but it had been so troublesome to
weigh and consider them all properly, that they had been put aside to be settled when he grew
stronger. But this difficulty in which he was placed by his connexion with Ruth, associated
the idea of her in his mind with annoyance and angry regret at the whole affair. He wished,
in the languid way in which he wished and felt everything not immediately relating to his daily
comfort, that he had never seen her. It was a most awkward, a most unfortunate affair. Notwithstanding
this annoyance connected with and arising out of Ruth, he would not submit to hear her abused;
and something in his manner impressed this on his mother, for she immediately changed her mode
of attack.

This is an atom: 
"We may as well drop all dispute as to the young woman's manners; but I suppose you do not
mean to defend your connexion with her; I suppose you are not so lost to all sense of propriety
as to imagine it fit or desirable that your mother and this degraded girl should remain under
the same roof, liable to meet at any hour of the day?" She waited for an answer, but no answer
came.

This is an atom: 
"I ask you a simple question; is it, or is it not desirable?"

This is an atom: 
"I suppose it is not," he replied, gloomily.

This is an atom: 
"And _I_ suppose, from your manner, that you think the difficulty would be best solved by my
taking my departure, and leaving you with your vicious companion?"

This is an atom: 
Again no answer, but inward and increasing annoyance, of which Mr Bellingham considered Ruth
the cause. At length he spoke.

This is an atom: 
"Mother, you are not helping me in my difficulty. I have no desire to banish you, nor to hurt
you, after all your care for me. Ruth has not been so much to blame as you imagine, that I
must say; but I do not wish to see her again, if you can tell me how to arrange it otherwise,
without behaving unhandsomely. Only spare me all this worry while I am so weak. I put myself
in your hands. Dismiss her, as you wish it; but let it be done handsomely, and let me hear
no more about it; I cannot bear it; let me have a quiet life, without being lectured while
I am pent up here, and unable to shake off unpleasant thoughts."

This is an atom: 
"My dear Henry, rely upon me."

This is an atom: 
"No more, mother; it's a bad business, and I can hardly avoid blaming myself in the matter;
I don't want to dwell upon it."

This is an atom: 
"Don't be too severe in your self-reproaches while you are so feeble, dear Henry; it is right
to repent, but I have no doubt in my own mind she led you wrong with her artifices. But, as
you say, everything should be done handsomely. I confess I was deeply grieved when I first
heard of the affair, but since I have seen the girl-- Well! I'll say no more about her, since
I see it displeases you; but I am thankful to God that you see the error of your ways."

This is an atom: 
She sat silent, thinking for a little while, and then sent for her writing-case, and began
to write. Her son became restless, and nervously irritated.

This is an atom: 
"Mother," he said, "this affair worries me to death. I cannot shake off the thoughts of it."

This is an atom: 
"Leave it to me, I'll arrange it satisfactorily."

This is an atom: 
"Could we not leave to-night? I should not be so haunted by this annoyance in another place.
I dread seeing her again, because I fear a scene; and yet I believe I ought to see her, in
order to explain."

This is an atom: 
"You must not think of such a thing, Henry," said she, alarmed at the very idea. "Sooner than
that, we will leave in half an hour, and try to get to Pen trÃª Voelas to-night. It is not yet
three, and the evenings are very long. Simpson should stay and finish the packing; she could
go straight to London and meet us there. Macdonald and nurse could go with us. Could you bear
twenty miles, do you think?"

This is an atom: 
Anything to get rid of his uneasiness. He felt that he was not behaving as he should do, to
Ruth, though the really right never entered his head. But it would extricate him from his present
dilemma, and save him many lectures; he knew that his mother, always liberal where money was
concerned, would "do the thing handsomely," and it would always be easy to write and give Ruth
what explanation he felt inclined, in a day or two; so he consented, and soon lost some of
his uneasiness in watching the bustle of the preparation for their departure.

This is an atom: 
All this time Ruth was quietly spending in her room, beguiling the waiting, weary hours, with
pictures of the meeting at the end. Her room looked to the back, and was in a side-wing away
from the principal state apartments, consequently she was not roused to suspicion by any of
the commotion; but, indeed, if she had heard the banging of doors, the sharp directions, the
carriage-wheels, she would still not have suspected the truth; her own love was too faithful.

This is an atom: 
It was four o'clock and past, when some one knocked at her door, and, on entering, gave her
a note, which Mrs Bellingham had left. That lady had found some difficulty in wording it, so
as to satisfy herself, but it was as follows:

This is an atom: 
My son, on recovering from his illness, is, I thank God,
   happily conscious of the sinful way in which he has been
   living with you. By his earnest desire, and in order to
   avoid seeing you again, we are on the point of leaving
   this place; but before I go, I wish to exhort you to
   repentance, and to remind you that you will not have your
   own guilt alone upon your head, but that of any young man
   whom you may succeed in entrapping into vice. I shall
   pray that you may turn to an honest life, and I strongly
   recommend you, if indeed you are not 'dead in trespasses
   and sins,' to enter some penitentiary. In accordance
   with my son's wishes, I forward you in this envelope a
   bank-note of fifty pounds.

This is an atom: 
MARGARET BELLINGHAM.

This is an atom: 
Was this the end of all? Had he, indeed, gone? She started up, and asked this last question
of the servant, who, half guessing at the purport of the note, had lingered about the room,
curious to see the effect produced.

This is an atom: 
"Iss, indeed, miss; the carriage drove from the door as I came upstairs. You'll see it now
on the Yspytty road, if you'll please to come to the window of No. 24."

This is an atom: 
Ruth started up, and followed the chambermaid. Aye, there it was, slowly winding up the steep
white road, on which it seemed to move at a snail's pace.

This is an atom: 
She might overtake him--she might--she might speak one farewell word to him, print his face
on her heart with a last look--nay, when he saw her he might retract, and not utterly, for
ever, leave her. Thus she thought; and she flew back to her room, and snatching up her bonnet,
ran, tying the strings with her trembling hands as she went down the stairs, out at the nearest
door, little heeding the angry words of Mrs Morgan; for the hostess, more irritated at Mrs
Bellingham's severe upbraiding at parting, than mollified by her ample payment, was offended
by the circumstance of Ruth, in her wild haste, passing through the prohibited front door.

This is an atom: 
But Ruth was away before Mrs Morgan had finished her speech, out and away, scudding along the
road, thought-lost in the breathless rapidity of her motion. Though her heart and head beat
almost to bursting, what did it signify if she could but overtake the carriage? It was a nightmare,
constantly evading the most passionate wishes and endeavours, and constantly gaining ground.
Every time it was visible it was in fact more distant, but Ruth would not believe it. If she
could but gain the summit of that weary, everlasting hill, she believed that she could run
again, and would soon be nigh upon the carriage. As she ran, she prayed with wild eagerness;
she prayed that she might see his face once more, even if she died on the spot before him.
It was one of those prayers which God is too merciful to grant; but despairing and wild as
it was, Ruth put her soul into it, and prayed it again, and yet again.

This is an atom: 
Wave above wave of the ever-rising hills were gained, were crossed, and at last Ruth struggled
up to the very top and stood on the bare table of moor, brown and purple, stretching far away
till it was lost in the haze of the summer afternoon; and the white road was all flat before
her, but the carriage she sought and the figure she sought had disappeared. There was no human
being there; a few wild, black-faced mountain sheep quietly grazing near the road, as if it
were long since they had been disturbed by the passing of any vehicle, was all the life she
saw on the bleak moorland.

This is an atom: 
She threw herself down on the ling by the side of the road in despair. Her only hope was to
die, and she believed she was dying. She could not think; she could believe anything. Surely
life was a horrible dream, and God would mercifully awaken her from it. She had no penitence,
no consciousness of error or offence; no knowledge of any one circumstance but that he was
gone. Yet afterwards, long afterwards, she remembered the exact motion of a bright green beetle
busily meandering among the wild thyme near her, and she recalled the musical, balanced, wavering
drop of a skylark into her nest near the heather-bed where she lay. The sun was sinking low,
the hot air had ceased to quiver near the hotter earth, when she bethought her once more of
the note which she had impatiently thrown down before half mastering its contents. "Oh, perhaps,"
she thought, "I have been too hasty. There may be some words of explanation from him on the
other side of the page, to which, in my blind anguish, I never turned. I will go and find it."

This is an atom: 
She lifted herself heavily and stiffly from the crushed heather. She stood dizzy and confused
with her change of posture; and was so unable to move at first, that her walk was but slow
and tottering; but, by-and-by, she was tasked and goaded by thoughts which forced her into
rapid motion, as if, by it, she could escape from her agony. She came down on the level ground,
just as many gay or peaceful groups were sauntering leisurely home with hearts at ease; with
low laughs and quiet smiles, and many an exclamation at the beauty of the summer evening.

This is an atom: 
Ever since her adventure with the little boy and his sister, Ruth had habitually avoided encountering
these happy--innocents, may I call them?--these happy fellow-mortals! And even now, the habit
grounded on sorrowful humiliation had power over her; she paused, and then, on looking back,
she saw more people who had come into the main road from a side path. She opened a gate into
a pasture-field, and crept up to the hedge-bank until all should have passed by, and she could
steal into the inn unseen. She sat down on the sloping turf by the roots of an old hawthorn-tree
which grew in the hedge; she was still tearless with hot burning eyes; she heard the merry
walkers pass by; she heard the footsteps of the village children as they ran along to their
evening play; she saw the small black cows come into the fields after being milked; and life
seemed yet abroad. When would the world be still and dark, and fit for such a deserted, desolate
creature as she was? Even in her hiding-place she was not long at peace. The little children,
with their curious eyes peering here and there, had peeped through the hedge, and through the
gate, and now they gathered from all the four corners of the hamlet, and crowded round the
gate; and one more adventurous than the rest had run into the field to cry, "Gi' me a halfpenny,"
which set the example to every little one, emulous of his boldness; and there, where she sat,
low on the ground, and longing for the sure hiding-place earth gives to the weary, the children
kept running in, and pushing one another forwards, and laughing. Poor things; their time had
not come for understanding what sorrow is. Ruth would have begged them to leave her alone,
and not madden her utterly; but they knew no English save the one eternal "Gi' me a halfpenny."
She felt in her heart that there was no pity anywhere. Suddenly, while she thus doubted God,
a shadow fell across her garments, on which her miserable eyes were bent. She looked up. The
deformed gentleman she had twice before seen, stood there. He had been attracted by the noisy
little crowd, and had questioned them in Welsh, but not understanding enough of the language
to comprehend their answers, he had obeyed their signs, and entered the gate to which they
pointed. There he saw the young girl whom he had noticed at first for her innocent beauty,
and the second time for the idea he had gained respecting her situation; there he saw her,
crouched up like some hunted creature, with a wild, scared look of despair, which almost made
her lovely face seem fierce; he saw her dress soiled and dim, her bonnet crushed and battered
with her tossings to and fro on the moorland bed; he saw the poor, lost wanderer, and when
he saw her, he had compassion on her.

This is an atom: 
There was some look of heavenly pity in his eyes, as gravely and sadly they met her upturned
gaze, which touched her stony heart. Still looking at him, as if drawing some good influence
from him, she said low and mournfully, "He has left me, sir!--sir, he has indeed--he has gone
and left me!"

This is an atom: 
Before he could speak a word to comfort her, she had burst into the wildest, dreariest crying
ever mortal cried. The settled form of the event, when put into words, went sharp to her heart;
her moans and sobs wrung his soul; but as no speech of his could be heard, if he had been able
to decide what best to say, he stood by her in apparent calmness, while she, wretched, wailed
and uttered her woe. But when she lay worn out, and stupefied into silence, she heard him say
to himself, in a low voice:

This is an atom: 
"Oh, my God! for Christ's sake, pity her!"

This is an atom: 
Ruth lifted up her eyes, and looked at him with a dim perception of the meaning of his words.
She regarded him fixedly in a dreamy way, as if they struck some chord in her heart, and she
were listening to its echo; and so it was. His pitiful look, or his words, reminded her of
the childish days when she knelt at her mother's knee, and she was only conscious of a straining,
longing desire to recall it all.

This is an atom: 
He let her take her time, partly because he was powerfully affected himself by all the circumstances,
and by the sad pale face upturned to his; and partly by an instinctive consciousness that the
softest patience was required. But suddenly she startled him, as she herself was startled into
a keen sense of the suffering agony of the present; she sprang up and pushed him aside, and
went rapidly towards the gate of the field. He could not move as quickly as most men, but he
put forth his utmost speed. He followed across the road, on to the rocky common; but as he
went along, with his uncertain gait, in the dusk gloaming, he stumbled, and fell over some
sharp projecting stone. The acute pain which shot up his back forced a short cry from him;
and, when bird and beast are hushed into rest and the stillness of the night is over all, a
high-pitched sound, like the voice of pain, is carried far in the quiet air. Ruth, speeding
on in her despair, heard the sharp utterance, and stopped suddenly short. It did what no remonstrance
could have done; it called her out of herself. The tender nature was in her still, in that
hour when all good angels seemed to have abandoned her. In the old days she could never bear
to hear or see bodily suffering in any of God's meanest creatures, without trying to succour
them; and now, in her rush to the awful death of the suicide, she stayed her wild steps, and
turned to find from whom that sharp sound of anguish had issued.

This is an atom: 
He lay among the white stones, too faint with pain to move, but with an agony in his mind far
keener than any bodily pain, as he thought that by his unfortunate fall he had lost all chance
of saving her. He was almost overpowered by his intense thankfulness when he saw her white
figure pause, and stand listening, and turn again with slow footsteps, as if searching for
some lost thing. He could hardly speak, but he made a sound which, though his heart was inexpressibly
glad, was like a groan. She came quickly towards him.

This is an atom: 
"I am hurt," said he; "do not leave me;" his disabled and tender frame was overcome by the
accident and the previous emotions, and he fainted away. Ruth flew to the little mountain stream,
the dashing sound of whose waters had been tempting her, but a moment before, to seek forgetfulness
in the deep pool into which they fell. She made a basin of her joined hands, and carried enough
of the cold fresh water back to dash into his face and restore him to consciousness. While
he still kept silence, uncertain what to say best fitted to induce her to listen to him, she
said softly:

This is an atom: 
"Are you better, sir?--are you very much hurt?"

This is an atom: 
"Not very much; I am better. Any quick movement is apt to cause me a sudden loss of power in
my back, and I believe I stumbled over some of these projecting stones. It will soon go off,
and you will help me to go home, I am sure."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes! Can you go now? I am afraid of your lying too long on this heather; there is a heavy
dew."

This is an atom: 
He was so anxious to comply with her wish, and not weary out her thought for him, and so turn
her back upon herself, that he tried to rise. The pain was acute, and this she saw.

This is an atom: 
"Don't hurry yourself, sir; I can wait."

This is an atom: 
Then came across her mind the recollection of the business that was thus deferred; but the
few homely words which had been exchanged between them seemed to have awakened her from her
madness. She sat down by him, and, covering her face with her hands, cried mournfully and unceasingly.
She forgot his presence, and yet she had a consciousness that some one looked for her kind
offices, that she was wanted in the world, and must not rush hastily out of it. The consciousness
did not take this definite form, it did not become a thought, but it kept her still, and it
was gradually soothing her.

This is an atom: 
"Can you help me to rise now?" said he, after a while. She did not speak, but she helped him
up, and then he took her arm, and she led him tenderly through all the little velvet paths,
where the turf grew short and soft between the rugged stones. Once more on the highway, they
slowly passed along in the moonlight. He guided her by a slight motion of the arm, through
the more unfrequented lanes, to his lodgings at the shop; for he thought for her, and conceived
the pain she would have in seeing the lighted windows of the inn. He leant more heavily on
her arm, as they awaited the opening of the door.

This is an atom: 
"Come in," said he, not relaxing his hold, and yet dreading to tighten it, lest she should
defy restraint, and once more rush away.

This is an atom: 
They went slowly into the little parlour behind the shop. The bonny-looking hostess, Mrs Hughes
by name, made haste to light the candle, and then they saw each other, face to face. The deformed
gentleman looked very pale, but Ruth looked as if the shadow of death was upon her.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER IX

This is an atom: 
The Storm-Spirit Subdued

This is an atom: 
Mrs Hughes bustled about with many a sympathetic exclamation, now in pretty broken English,
now in more fluent Welsh, which sounded as soft as Russian or Italian, in her musical voice.
Mr Benson, for that was the name of the hunchback, lay on the sofa, thinking; while the tender
Mrs Hughes made every arrangement for his relief from pain. He had lodged with her for three
successive years, and she knew and loved him.

This is an atom: 
Ruth stood in the little bow-window, looking out. Across the moon, and over the deep blue heavens,
large, torn, irregular-shaped clouds went hurrying, as if summoned by some storm-spirit. The
work they were commanded to do was not here; the mighty gathering-place lay eastward, immeasurable
leagues, and on they went, chasing each other over the silent earth, now black, now silver-white
at one transparent edge, now with the moon shining like Hope through their darkest centre,
now again with a silver lining; and now, utterly black, they sailed lower in the lift, and
disappeared behind the immovable mountains; they were rushing in the very direction in which
Ruth had striven and struggled to go that afternoon; they, in their wild career, would soon
pass over the very spot where he (her world's he) was lying sleeping, or perhaps not sleeping,
perhaps thinking of her. The storm was in her mind, and rent and tore her purposes into forms
as wild and irregular as the heavenly shapes she was looking at. If, like them, she could pass
the barrier horizon in the night, she might overtake him.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson saw her look, and read it partially. He saw her longing gaze outwards upon the free,
broad world, and thought that the syren waters, whose deadly music yet rang in her ears, were
again tempting her. He called her to him, praying that his feeble voice might have power.

This is an atom: 
"My dear young lady, I have much to say to you; and God has taken my strength from me now when
I most need it.--Oh, I sin to speak so--but, for His sake, I implore you to be patient here,
if only till to-morrow morning." He looked at her, but her face was immovable, and she did
not speak. She could not give up her hope, her chance, her liberty till to-morrow.

This is an atom: 
"God help me," said he, mournfully, "my words do not touch her;" and, still holding her hand,
he sank back on the pillows. Indeed, it was true that his words did not vibrate in her atmosphere.
The storm-spirit raged there, and filled her heart with the thought that she was an outcast;
and the holy words, "for His sake," were answered by the demon, who held possession, with a
blasphemous defiance of the merciful God:

This is an atom: 
"What have I to do with Thee?"

This is an atom: 
He thought of every softening influence of religion which over his own disciplined heart had
power, but put them aside as useless. Then the still small voice whispered, and he spake:

This is an atom: 
"In your mother's name, whether she be dead or alive, I command you to stay here until I am
able to speak to you."

This is an atom: 
She knelt down at the foot of the sofa, and shook it with her sobs. Her heart was touched,
and he hardly dared to speak again. At length he said:

This is an atom: 
"I know you will not go--you could not--for her sake. You will not, will you?"

This is an atom: 
"No," whispered Ruth; and then there was a great blank in her heart. She had given up her chance.
She was calm, in the utter absence of all hope.

This is an atom: 
"And now you will do what I tell you," said he, gently, but, unconsciously to himself, in the
tone of one who has found the hidden spell by which to rule spirits.

This is an atom: 
She slowly said, "Yes." But she was subdued.

This is an atom: 
He called Mrs Hughes. She came from her adjoining shop.

This is an atom: 
"You have a bedroom within yours, where your daughter used to sleep, I think? I am sure you
will oblige me, and I shall consider it as a great favour, if you will allow this young lady
to sleep there to-night. Will you take her there now? Go, my dear. I have full trust in your
promise not to leave until I can speak to you." His voice died away to silence; but as Ruth
rose from her knees at his bidding, she looked at his face through her tears. His lips were
moving in earnest, unspoken prayer, and she knew it was for her.

This is an atom: 
That night, although his pain was relieved by rest, he could not sleep; and, as in fever, the
coming events kept unrolling themselves before him in every changing and fantastic form. He
met Ruth in all possible places and ways, and addressed her in every manner he could imagine
most calculated to move and affect her to penitence and virtue. Towards morning he fell asleep,
but the same thoughts haunted his dreams; he spoke, but his voice refused to utter aloud; and
she fled, relentless, to the deep, black pool.

This is an atom: 
But God works in His own way.

This is an atom: 
The visions melted into deep, unconscious sleep. He was awakened by a knock at the door, which
seemed a repetition of what he had heard in his last sleeping moments.

This is an atom: 
It was Mrs Hughes. She stood at the first word of permission within the room.

This is an atom: 
"Please, sir, I think the young lady is very ill indeed, sir; perhaps you would please to come
to her."

This is an atom: 
"How is she ill?" said he, much alarmed.

This is an atom: 
"Quite quiet-like, sir; but I think she is dying, that's all, indeed, sir!"

This is an atom: 
"Go away, I will be with you directly!" he replied, his heart sinking within him.

This is an atom: 
In a very short time he was standing with Mrs Hughes by Ruth's bedside. She lay as still as
if she were dead, her eyes shut, her wan face numbed into a fixed anguish of expression. She
did not speak when they spoke, though after a while they thought she strove to do so. But all
power of motion and utterance had left her. She was dressed in everything, except her bonnet,
as she had been the day before; although sweet, thoughtful Mrs Hughes had provided her with
nightgear, which lay on the little chest of drawers that served as a dressing-table. Mr Benson
lifted up her arm to feel her feeble, fluttering pulse; and when he let go her hand, it fell
upon the bed in a dull, heavy way, as if she were already dead.

This is an atom: 
"You gave her some food?" said he, anxiously, to Mrs Hughes.

This is an atom: 
"Indeed, and I offered her the best in the house, but she shook her poor pretty head, and only
asked if I would please to get her a cup of water. I brought her some milk though, and 'deed,
I think she'd rather have had the water; but not to seem sour and cross, she took some milk."
By this time Mrs Hughes was fairly crying.

This is an atom: 
"When does the doctor come up here?"

This is an atom: 
"Indeed, sir, and he's up nearly every day now, the inn is so full."

This is an atom: 
"I'll go for him. And can you manage to undress her and lay her in bed? Open the window too,
and let in the air; if her feet are cold, put bottles of hot water to them."

This is an atom: 
It was a proof of the true love, which was the nature of both, that it never crossed their
minds to regret that this poor young creature had been thus thrown upon their hands. On the
contrary, Mrs Hughes called it "a blessing."

This is an atom: 
"It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER X

This is an atom: 
A Note and the Answer

This is an atom: 
At the inn everything was life and bustle. Mr Benson had to wait long in Mrs Morgan's little
parlour before she could come to him, and he kept growing more and more impatient. At last
she made her appearance and heard his story.

This is an atom: 
FLANAGAN Co., Chicago, Ill., at price given. Considerable reductions may be secured, if several

SPECIAL SUGGESTIONS.

This is an atom: 
Children love to read or hear of the people of other lands, and the tactful teacher will wrap
her information about the natural features of a country in the "sugared pill of stories."
Books of travel are helpful and interesting in linking together
fact and story.

This is an atom: 
From them the child comes to feel a sympathetic interest in the
ways of people unlike those he knows.

This is an atom: 
By emphasizing the idea of continuity of beliefs and customs, we impress the child with the most
important lesson history and geography hold for him,--that all countries and peoples are
closely related and have mutual interests.

This is an atom: 
"The acquisition of this feeling of the inter-relationship of the nations of the world, while
starting the child out with a broad view of life, will in no wise lessen his love for his own
country."
Too often the lonely little stranger in our midst--the foreigner--is viewed with heartless
curiosity, or contempt, and subjected to ridicule.

This is an atom: 
Patriotism to many a child means nothing more than a belief that our own country is the best,
our own people the smartest, and that we can whip any and every other nation on the globe.

This is an atom: 
Do the children know that the "blood that boils so hotly against other countries is drawn from
the very same sources that feed the veins of our seemingly alien
neighbors"?

This is an atom: 
If any teacher imagines that her pupils have a definite idea of the meaning of patriotism because
they are able to sing "America" and the "Star-Spangled Banner,"
let her read Marion Hill's story, entitled "The Star-Spangled
Banner," in McClure's Magazine for July (1900).

This is an atom: 
THE TRAVEL CLASS.

This is an atom: 
Nothing in the study of geography is more interesting or helpful to pupils than the taking of
imaginary journeys. It makes geography a _live_ subject.

This is an atom: 
Suggest that your pupils organize a Travel Club, and that some of the trips be personally
conducted.

This is an atom: 
Maps and a globe should be in constant use. The home should be the starting point. Railroad
circulars, maps, and time-cards for free distribution will be found valuable. Pupils should
be taught _how to use_ these maps and time cards.

This is an atom: 
Give pupils a choice as to routes or roads over which they are to travel. Each pupil, however,
should be able to give a reason for his preference for any particular
road, and must know the number of miles and the time required for
the journey.

This is an atom: 
The road or route voted upon by the majority may
   then be decided upon, and preparations made for
   the trip.
   
   Find out the best time to go to each particular country,
   and the reason. What clothes it will be best to wear and
   to take with one. About how much money it will be
   necessary to spend on such a trip, and when and where this
   money should be changed into the coin or currency used in
   the country we expect to visit.

This is an atom: 
A _Guide_ may be
   appointed to obtain time-tables, maps, railroad guides, the little
books of travel, or other descriptions of routes and of the parts
of the country that are to be visited.

This is an atom: 
(Further suggestions in regard to these "helps" will be found
elsewhere in this book.)

This is an atom: 
The principal features of the country passed through may be described, if time permits; also
the more important cities. Note the population, occupations, productions, together with anything
of special interest or historical importance associated with the city or locality.

This is an atom: 
The _Guide_ takes charge of the class in the same way that a tourist guide would do. He
escorts us from the home depot to the city, state, or country, pointing out the route on a
map suspended before the class.

This is an atom: 
Arriving at the city or country, he takes us to the various points of interest, telling as much
about each as he is able, and answering questions pupils may wish to ask. If the guide can not
answer all questions, the teacher or some other member of the party may.

This is an atom: 
When the guide has finished with a topic or section, other members of the party may give items
of interest concerning it.

This is an atom: 
A different pupil may act as guide to each city or part of the country visited, and each pupil should
come to the class with a list of questions about the places.

This is an atom: 
Every pupil in the class may take some part, either as guide, or
as the class artist, musician, librarian, historian, geographer,
geologist, botanist, zoologist, or man of letters.

This is an atom: 
A _Historian_ may tell us of the history of the country, and answer all questions of historical
interest.

This is an atom: 
A _Geographer_ may tell of the location on the globe, of the natural land formations of mountains,
canons, prairies, rivers, etc., and of the climate resulting from
these.

This is an atom: 
He should illustrate his remarks.

This is an atom: 
A _Geologist_ may assist, and show specimens of minerals and fossils, or pictures of these.

This is an atom: 
A _Botanist_ may tell us of native plants, useful or ornamental,
and show pictures of these if possible.

This is an atom: 
A _Zoologist_ tells of the native animals, their habits and uses.

This is an atom: 
The geographer, geologist, botanist, and zoologist direct the work at the sand table, and assist
in reproducing the country in miniature.

This is an atom: 
The _Merchants_ and _Tradesmen_ tell us of the products for which
their country is noted, and show samples of as many as it is possible
to secure.

This is an atom: 
They also tell what they import, and why.

This is an atom: 
A _Librarian_ or Correspondent may visit the library for information
sought by the club.

This is an atom: 
He must be able to give a list of books of travel, and be ready to read or quote extracts
referring to the places visited on the tour.

This is an atom: 
He or his assistant may also clip all articles of interest from papers, magazines, and other
sources, and arrange these, as well as the articles secured by
other pupils, in a scrapbook, devoted to each country.

This is an atom: 
The _Artist_ and his assistant may tell us about the famous artists and their works, if any.

This is an atom: 
He may illustrate his remarks with pictures, if he can obtain or make them.

This is an atom: 
The _Club Artist_ may also place upon the board in colored crayons the flag, the coat of arms,
and the national flower of the country.

This is an atom: 
A _Photographer_ may be appointed to provide or care for the
photographs and pictures used in the class talks.

This is an atom: 
The photographs may often be borrowed from tourists or others. Pictures may be obtained from
magazines, railroad pamphlets, the illustrated papers, or from the Perry Pictures, and mounted
on cardboard or arranged by the artist in a scrapbook with the name of the country on the
cover.

This is an atom: 
If the members of the travel or geography class are not provided with the "LITTLE JOURNEYS,"
the teacher should have at least two copies. The pictures from one of these books should be
removed and mounted for class use. They may be mounted on a screen,
or on cardboard, and placed about the room or grouped in a corner.

This is an atom: 
They should be allowed to remain there during the month, that all the pupils may have an opportunity
to examine them.

This is an atom: 
Another pupil may collect curiosities.

This is an atom: 
Many families in each neighborhood will be able to
   contribute some curio. Pupils in other rooms in the
   building will be interested in collecting and loaning
   material for this little museum and picture gallery.
   
   Coins and stamps may be placed with this collection. Begin
   a stamp album, and collect the stamps of all the countries
   studied. The stamps of many countries show the heads of the
   rulers. One of the most attractive of these is the
   United States postage stamp showing "Columbus in Sight
   of Land."
   The album should be kept on the reading table with the
   scrapbooks, in order that pupils may have access to it
   during their periods of leisure.

This is an atom: 
Dolls may be dressed in the national costume or to represent historical personages.

This is an atom: 
This form of construction work may be done outside of school hours
by pupils under the direction of the historian and artist.

This is an atom: 
The dolls, when dressed, may be made the centers of court, home,
field or forest scenes arranged on the sand table.

This is an atom: 
A _Musician_ or musicians may tell us of the characteristic music
of the country, and of famous singers or composers.

This is an atom: 
She may also sing or play the national song or air of the country, if there be one.

This is an atom: 
The singer should be dressed in national costume, if it is possible to secure it, or to make it
out of calico, paper, or some other cheap material.

This is an atom: 
A _Man of Letters_ may tell of the famous men and women of the
country through which we are traveling, and may visit their homes
with us.

This is an atom: 
He may call attention to the literature of the people and
   give selections from noted writers, from or about the places
   visited.
   
   PREPARATIONS FOR THE TRIP.
   
   With maps, guide-books, time-tables and notebooks before us, we
look up the steamer lines and routes and decide when, where, and
how to go.

This is an atom: 
(Good maps will be found in the railroad guide-books).

This is an atom: 
City newspapers publish once a week the lines of steamboats and
their times of sailing.

This is an atom: 
The steamboat agents also furnish advertising matter giving
   other necessary and interesting information.
   
   When we have decided upon our route, we telegraph ahead for our
staterooms.

This is an atom: 
Now let us plan for our baggage. What kind of a trunk must we take? Why a steamer trunk? How
large must this be? What will we do with this trunk when we leave the boat? (We are advised
to leave it and part of its contents at the ship company's office. They will store it until we are
ready to take the return trip).

This is an atom: 
How many pounds of baggage are we allowed on the steamer?
   
   What other baggage shall we take (hand bags)? Why not small
   trunks? (Because every pound of baggage must be paid for
   in some countries.) Many countries have not our convenient
   system of checking baggage. What else will we need?
   (Traveling rugs.)

This is an atom: 
What clothes must we take?

This is an atom: 
First, we must take warm clothes for steamer wear, which may be
packed away when we arrive.

This is an atom: 
Then we must take traveling suits for train wear, and thin clothing to use after arriving at
our destination.

This is an atom: 
We have promised friends at home that we will inform them of our safe arrival immediately.
How can we do this? By mail? Is there not a quicker way?

This is an atom: 
How many know of the cable? How many have ever sent a cablegram? Can we cable from Puerto
Rico? How much will it cost? Our guide-books give us all this information.

This is an atom: 
We must have guide-books, phrase books, toilet articles and writing materials. These should
be packed in linen or canvas bags, because more easily carried about than heavy leather
satchels.

This is an atom: 
Our guide must be able to speak Spanish, for that is the language of the Puerto Rican people.

This is an atom: 
If one of our party acts as guide, we must be careful to select a polite, tactful, and, above
all, a patient and good-natured person. Why?--Because his patience will be severely taxed
many times during this trip.

This is an atom: 
Arriving at the city from which we are to sail, we visit points of interest, the docks especially, and
compare our steamer with others, learning what we can about all the ships in the harbor.

This is an atom: 
If our lesson is well planned, we can accomplish a great deal the day we sail.

This is an atom: 
CLASS WORK.

This is an atom: 
After two or three conversational lessons, let pupils begin their diaries (composition
books).
In these may be written descriptions of what they see, hear, or read about the place being
studied or visited.

This is an atom: 
In most schools will be found one or more pupils who have been upon
or crossed the ocean.

This is an atom: 
Let them give both oral and written descriptions of the voyage.

This is an atom: 
In giving accounts of these journeys, have pupils describe the incidents and details of
everyday life on ship-board. They may tell of the ship, its furnishings, rigging, engines,
officers and crew.

This is an atom: 
Let them also describe the dining room, the meals, and the manner
of serving.

This is an atom: 
They may further describe a stateroom or berth, and picture their
fellow passengers in words or drawings.

This is an atom: 
It will greatly cultivate their power of expression to tell how the time on board the vessel was
passed, and to narrate any interesting occurrences of the voyage.

This is an atom: 
They may describe the ocean by day and by night; also its appearance in a storm.

This is an atom: 
Many will be interested in descriptions of the birds that were met and of the fishes that swarmed
about the ship.

This is an atom: 
If time will not permit each pupil to give oral descriptions or to
write compositions on each topic, assign a different topic to each
pupil.

This is an atom: 
Bind all papers together, when finished, to keep with scrap-books devoted to the country
visited.

This is an atom: 
These diaries or reproduction stories may be illustrated with
pictures clipped from illustrated papers and other sources or by
original drawings.

This is an atom: 
Try to secure specimens of seaweed to be exhibited to pupils during the lesson on the sea
voyage.

AFTERNOONS ABROAD.

This is an atom: 
At the conclusion of the study of a country, a topic may be assigned
to each pupil, or selected by him.

This is an atom: 
With this topic he is to become thoroughly familiar.

This is an atom: 
In place of the old-time review, invitations may be issued by the pupils, and the results of the
month's work be summed up in the form of an entertainment, called--
AFTERNOONS OR EVENINGS ABROAD.

This is an atom: 
When a class, club, or school has been studying a country, the work
may be brought to a close in a way that pupils and their parents
and friends will enjoy and remember, by giving _An Afternoon or
Evening Abroad_.

This is an atom: 
This form of geography review would be appreciated more particularly
in villages, or in country districts, where entertainments, books,
pictures, and opportunities for study and social intercourse are
rarer than in cities.

This is an atom: 
At the conclusion of an afternoon talk or entertainment, any pictures
used may be placed on the chalk tray along the blackboard, that
visitors may examine them more closely.

This is an atom: 
If the entertainment is given in the evening, the teacher may be
able to use stereopticon views.

This is an atom: 
These will prove a very great attraction to both pupils and parents,
and should be secured if possible.

This is an atom: 
The lantern with oil lamp may be easily operated by the teacher
while the pupils give the descriptions of the pictures or give talks
about the country.

This is an atom: 
The lanterns and slides may be rented for the evening or afternoon at reasonable rates, and
the cost covered by an admission fee of from ten to twenty-five cents. In sending for
catalogue and terms, ask for the paper used to darken windows if the lantern is to be used in
the afternoon.

This is an atom:

A PUERTO RICAN MARKET PLACE.

This is an atom: 
Decorate the room with ferns, potted palms and other tropical plants, or pictures of them.
(Exact reproductions in paper or other material can now be procured at small cost.) On one
side of the room have one table devoted to Puerto Rican curios;
another to fruits and vegetables; and a third to other products
from the island.

This is an atom: 
(Or fit up one end or corner as a market place in San Juan or Ponce.)

This is an atom: 
Explain your plan for the entertainment to your groceryman and other
merchants most convenient to your school, and enlist their aid.

This is an atom: 
They will usually be willing to lend products imported from or
native to the country.

This is an atom: 
For a list of the fruits and vegetables to be exhibited in the
market place, see the list given when on a visit to the market place
at San Juan. (See p. 22).
On the product-tables arrange pieces of sugar cane, samples of raw,
loaf, granulated, and powdered sugar, and of molasses. If possible
to secure the stalks of sugar cane, have short lengths to be sold
for consumption--as in Puerto Rico. Near the table, tack up pictures
of sugar plantations and mills. Have the coffee-berry and beans,
ground coffee, cups of coffee prepared as a drink, and pictures of
the tree, fruit, and coffee plantations; also secure specimens of
the fruit of the cacao tree, a cake of solid chocolate, chocolate
candy, and a cake containing chocolate layers. Cups of cacao or
chocolate may be prepared as a drink. Have near pictures of the
cacao tree and fruit.
Secure, if possible, samples of rice, allspice, nutmeg, mace,
cinnamon, pepper, cloves, ginger and vanilla; bottles of clove oil
and bay rum; packages of the annatto and logwood dyes; sponges,
tortoise-shell combs, and articles made of cedar, ebony, or mahogany,
or pieces of these woods.
The tables and booths in the market places should be presided over
by pupils dressed as Puerto Ricans, and venders should go about the
room, after the entertainment is over, with native wares to
sell.
Among these venders will be the bread man, the milk man, the fruit
and vegetable man, the dulce seller, and the vender of ices.
These venders should, if possible, carry their wares as the Puerto
Ricans do.

This is an atom: 
COSTUMES.
The girls may be costumed in very simply made white dresses.
Handkerchiefs may be tied about the head, for head coverings.
The boys may be dressed in loose white trousers, girdled at the
waist by a belt of leather, a white shirt, and a silk or cotton
handkerchief around the neck.

This is an atom: 
A broad brimmed hat may be worn.
The dulce seller carries guava, pieces of pineapple, preserved
fruits, chocolate candy, fresh cocoanut meat, grated cocoanut,
etc.
The bread vender carries small rolls on his tray. The milk man
carries his can upon his head, ready to serve milk from tin cups
which are tied to the sides of the can.

This is an atom: 
REFRESHMENTS.
These may be served during an intermission or at the close of the
entertainment, and may consist of the national drinks, orangeade,
lemonade, chocolate, coffee, cocoanut milk, and of rolls, cheese,
native fruits and confectionery.
The pupils who serve these refreshments should be prepared to tell
something of the way in which these refreshments are prepared and
served in Puerto Rico.
One of the favorite drinks of the people of Puerto Rico is orangeade.
This is made as we make lemonade, except that the juice of the
orange is used in place of that of the lemon. In making lemonade
they use limes more frequently than lemons.
Coffee and chocolate are drinks also very much in use. The chocolate
is made about the consistency of thick gruel and served with a
light, thin cake.
The coffee is made very strong and only a small amount placed in
the cup. The cup is then filled with boiling milk.
Among the favorite sweetmeats are the guava jelly and marmalade.
The jelly looks much like our currant jelly; the marmalade resembles
quince marmalade. It is usually served with cheese.
Secure some of these sweetmeats for the booth or shop, and serve
bits to those who wish to buy. The small, flat boxes are the best
for this purpose.
Fresh cocoanut meat should be removed from the shell and divided
into penny squares, that the pupils may be able to buy a bit for a
penny.

This is an atom: 
AN AFTERNOON IN PUERTO RICO.

This is an atom: 
PROGRAMME.
1. Introductory remarks by the guide, who explains our plan of
celebrating the anniversary of the discovery of Puerto Rico by
Columbus, Nov. 17, 1493, by a journey to that island, Nov.
17, 1900, to be spent at Aguadilla, the first landing place of
Columbus on Puerto Rico.
2. Another pupil gives a short talk on the location, size and surface
of Puerto Rico, using a large map.
3. History of Puerto Rico by the class historian.
4. Climate of Puerto Rico, with description of a West Indies
hurricane.

This is an atom: 
5. Preparation for the trip.
6. Recitation--"Southern Seas" (given on the following pages).
7. Song,--"Life on the Ocean Wave."
8. Description of our voyage, by a pupil who has made an ocean
voyage.

This is an atom: 
9. Harbor and city of San Juan.
10. Points of interest in the city.

This is an atom: 
11.Quite a child,
poor creature! When will the doctor come, Thurstan? Tell me all about her; you have never told
me the particulars."

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson might have said, she had never cared to hear them before, and had rather avoided
the subject; but he was too happy to see this awakening of interest in his sister's warm heart
to say anything in the least reproachful. He told her the story as well as he could; and, as
he felt it deeply, he told it with heart's eloquence; and, as he ended and looked at her, there
were tears in the eyes of both.

This is an atom: 
"And what does the doctor say?" asked she, after a pause.

This is an atom: 
"He insists upon quiet; he orders medicines and strong broth. I cannot tell you all; Mrs Hughes
can. She has been so truly good. 'Doing good, hoping for nothing again.'"

This is an atom: 
"She looks very sweet and gentle. I shall sit up to-night and watch her myself; and I shall
send you and Mrs Hughes early to bed, for you have both a worn look about you I don't like.
Are you sure the effect of that fall has gone off? Do you feel anything of it in your back
still? After all, I owe her something for turning back to your help. Are you sure she was going
to drown herself?"

This is an atom: 
"I cannot be sure, for I have not questioned her. She has not been in a state to be questioned;
but I have no doubt whatever about it. But you must not think of sitting up after your journey,
Faith."

This is an atom: 
"Answer me, Thurstan. Do you feel any bad effect from that fall?"

This is an atom: 
"No, hardly any. Don't sit up, Faith, to-night!"

This is an atom: 
"Thurstan, it's no use talking, for I shall; and, if you go on opposing me, I dare say I shall
attack your back, and put a blister on it. Do tell me what that 'hardly any' means. Besides,
to set you quite at ease, you know I have never seen mountains before, and they fill me and
oppress me so much that I could not sleep; I must keep awake this first night, and see that
they don't fall on the earth and overwhelm it. And now answer my questions about yourself."

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson had the power, which some people have, of carrying her wishes through to their
fulfilment; her will was strong, her sense was excellent, and people yielded to her--they did
not know why. Before ten o'clock she reigned sole power and potentate in Ruth's little chamber.
Nothing could have been better devised for giving her an interest in the invalid. The very
dependence of one so helpless upon her care inclined her heart towards her. She thought she
perceived a slight improvement in the symptoms during the night, and she was a little pleased
that this progress should have been made while she reigned monarch of the sick-room. Yes, certainly
there was an improvement. There was more consciousness in the look of the eyes, although the
whole countenance still retained its painful traces of acute suffering, manifested in an anxious,
startled, uneasy aspect. It was broad morning light, though barely five o'clock, when Miss
Benson caught the sight of Ruth's lips moving, as if in speech. Miss Benson stooped down to listen.

This is an atom: 
"Who are you?" asked Ruth, in the faintest of whispers.

This is an atom: 
"Miss Benson--Mr Benson's sister," she replied.

This is an atom: 
The words conveyed no knowledge to Ruth; on the contrary, weak as a babe in mind and body as
she was, her lips began to quiver, and her eyes to show a terror similar to that of any little
child who wakens in the presence of a stranger, and sees no dear, familiar face of mother or
nurse to reassure its trembling heart.

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson took her hand in hers, and began to stroke it caressingly.

This is an atom: 
"Don't be afraid, dear; I'm a friend come to take care of you. Would you like some tea now,
my love?"

This is an atom: 
The very utterance of these gentle words was unlocking Miss Benson's heart. Her brother was
surprised to see her so full of interest, when he came to inquire later on in the morning.
It required Mrs Hughes's persuasions, as well as his own, to induce her to go to bed for an
hour or two after breakfast; and, before she went, she made them promise that she should be
called when the doctor came. He did not come until late in the afternoon. The invalid was rallying
fast, though rallying to a consciousness of sorrow, as was evinced by the tears which came
slowly rolling down her pale sad cheeks--tears which she had not the power to wipe away.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson had remained in the house all day to hear the doctor's opinion; and now that he was
relieved from the charge of Ruth by his sister's presence, he had the more time to dwell upon
the circumstances of her case--so far as they were known to him. He remembered his first sight
of her; her little figure swaying to and fro as she balanced herself on the slippery stones,
half smiling at her own dilemma, with a bright, happy light in the eyes that seemed like a
reflection from the glancing waters sparkling below. Then he recalled the changed, affrighted
look of those eyes as they met his, after the child's rebuff of her advances;--how that little
incident filled up the tale at which Mrs Hughes had hinted, in a kind of sorrowful way, as
if loath (as a Christian should be) to believe evil. Then that fearful evening, when he had
only just saved her from committing suicide, and that nightmare sleep! And now, lost, forsaken,
and but just delivered from the jaws of death, she lay dependent for everything on his sister
and him,--utter strangers a few weeks ago. Where was her lover? Could he be easy and happy?
Could he grow into perfect health, with these great sins pressing on his conscience with a
strong and hard pain? Or had he a conscience?

This is an atom: 
Into whole labyrinths of social ethics Mr Benson's thoughts wandered, when his sister entered
suddenly and abruptly.

This is an atom: 
"What does the doctor say? Is she better?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes! she's better," answered Miss Benson, sharp and short. Her brother looked at her in
dismay. She bumped down into a chair in a cross, disconcerted manner. They were both silent
for a few minutes; only Miss Benson whistled and clucked alternately.

This is an atom: 
"What is the matter, Faith? You say she is better."

This is an atom: 
"Why, Thurstan, there is something so shocking the matter, that I cannot tell you."

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson changed colour with affright. All things possible and impossible crossed his mind
but the right one. I said, "all things possible;" I made a mistake. He never believed Ruth
to be more guilty than she seemed.

This is an atom: 
"Faith, I wish you would tell me, and not bewilder me with those noises of yours," said he,
nervously.

This is an atom: 
"I beg your pardon; but something so shocking has just been discovered--I don't know how to
word it--She will have a child. The doctor says so."

This is an atom: 
She was allowed to make noises unnoticed for a few minutes. Her brother did not speak. At last
she wanted his sympathy.

This is an atom: 
"Isn't it shocking, Thurstan? You might have knocked me down with a straw when he told me."

This is an atom: 
"Does she know?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes; and I am not sure that that isn't the worst part of all."

This is an atom: 
"How?--what do you mean?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh! I was just beginning to have a good opinion of her, but I'm afraid she is very depraved.
After the doctor was gone, she pulled the bed-curtain aside, and looked as if she wanted to
speak to me. (I can't think how she heard, for we were close to the window, and spoke very
low.) Well, I went to her, though I really had taken quite a turn against her. And she whispered,
quite eagerly, 'Did he say I should have a baby?' Of course, I could not keep it from her;
but I thought it my duty to look as cold and severe as I could. She did not seem to understand
how it ought to be viewed, but took it just as if she had a right to have a baby. She said,
'Oh, my God, I thank Thee! Oh! I will be so good!' I had no patience with her then, so I left
the room."

This is an atom: 
"Who is with her?"

This is an atom: 
"Mrs Hughes. She is not seeing the thing in a moral light, as I should have expected."

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson was silent again. After some time he began:

This is an atom: 
"Faith, I don't see this affair quite as you do. I believe I am right."

This is an atom: 
"You surprise me, brother! I don't understand you."

This is an atom: 
"Wait awhile! I want to make my feelings very clear to you, but I don't know where to begin,
or how to express myself."

This is an atom: 
"It is, indeed, an extraordinary subject for us to have to talk about; but if once I get clear
of this girl, I'll wash my hands of all such cases again."

This is an atom: 
Her brother was not attending to her; he was reducing his own ideas to form.

This is an atom: 
"Faith, do you know I rejoice in this child's advent?"

This is an atom: 
"May God forgive you, Thurstan!--if you know what you are saying. But, surely, it is a temptation,
dear Thurstan."

This is an atom: 
"I do not think it is a delusion. The sin appears to me to be quite distinct from its consequences."

This is an atom: 
"Sophistry--and a temptation," said Miss Benson, decidedly.

This is an atom: 
"No, it is not," said her brother, with equal decision. "In the eye of God, she is exactly
the same as if the life she has led had left no trace behind. We knew her errors before, Faith."

This is an atom: 
"Yes, but not this disgrace--this badge of her shame!"

This is an atom: 
"Faith, Faith! let me beg of you not to speak so of the little innocent babe, who may be God's
messenger to lead her back to Him. Think again of her first words--the burst of nature from
her heart! Did she not turn to God, and enter into a covenant with Him--'I will be so good?'
Why, it draws her out of herself! If her life has hitherto been self-seeking, and wickedly
thoughtless, here is the very instrument to make her forget herself, and be thoughtful for
another. Teach her (and God will teach her, if man does not come between) to reverence her
child; and this reverence will shut out sin,--will be purification."

This is an atom: 
From the windows we get a fine view of the bay.

This is an atom: 
The people of San Juan have honored its founder with a statue, which
stands in the center of one of its plazas.

This is an atom: 
His remains are preserved in a leaden box in the church of Santo Domingo.

This is an atom: 
We find the famous Morro Castle to be a small military town in
itself, with houses, chapel, barracks, dungeons, water tanks,
warehouses, and also a light tower, a signal station, and a
light-saving station.

This is an atom: 
This ancient fort is the beginning of the wall which surrounds the city.

This is an atom: 
THE MARKET PLACE.

This is an atom: 
Look at these people coming in from the country! Our guide says they are going to the market
place. Let us follow them and see what a Puerto Rican market place is.

This is an atom: 
Here it is, situated near the ocean. The court is formed with stones,
and it contains booths for fruits, vegetables, and produce of all
kinds.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: GOING TO MARKET.]
Dear me! what a busy, noisy place!

This is an atom: 
People from every race and nation seem to be gathered here.
Big people, little people, babies, roosters, dogs, donkeys, horses! What talking, shouting,
laughing, crying, crowing, barking, and braying!

This is an atom: 
Men are smoking, lounging about, and bragging about their game-cocks; women are making small
purchases and gossiping with neighbors; babies are tumbling about
on the ground, devouring bits of fruit that come in their way: but
all are good-natured.

This is an atom: 
Each market man or woman has a place assigned, and within this space or in a booth are piled
high heaps of fruits and vegetables. And such fruits and vegetables
we never in our lives beheld or even dreamed of!

This is an atom: 
Heaps and heaps of golden, luscious oranges are offered us by the thousand, or two for a
penny.
Bananas are sold five for a cent, or a bunch of a hundred bananas
for twenty-five cents.

This is an atom: 
Think of it! In New York it would cost us three to five dollars.

This is an atom: 
There are ever and ever so many kinds of fruits of which we do not even know the name. But
we make a list of those whose names we do know, and here they are: oranges, bananas, plantains,
limes, lemons, cocoanuts, bread-fruit, bread nuts, pomegranates, dates, figs, pawpaws, the
tamarind, sugar apple, grosella, mammee, guava, granadilla,
naseberry, alligator pears, shaddocks, and Indian plums.

This is an atom: 
Could you find so many in a New York, New Orleans, Chicago, or San
Francisco market, do you think?

This is an atom: 
Then here are the vegetables. They would make even a longer list, but we note a few of those
with whose names and forms we are acquainted: yams, sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, carrots,
turnips, celery, beets, egg plant, radishes, peas, beans, tomatoes, cabbage, pumpkins, cantaloupes,
watermelons, squashes, peppers, cassava, yantias, and okra.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: A POULTRY DEALER.]

This is an atom: 
The people in the market, seeing that we are Americans, try to charge us many times what each
article is worth. If we travel very far, we will find that this is a custom of the people
in many countries. They think all Americans are rich.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: THE MARKET PLACE AT PONCE, PUERTO RICO.]

This is an atom: 
Now this is a great mistake, and so we decline very firmly to buy anything at all. This offends
the market people. They wish us to make them an offer.

This is an atom: 
They offer us their fruits for half the first price.

This is an atom: 
Again we refuse. A fourth of the original price. We shake our heads.

This is an atom: 
Our guide now offers to make our purchases for us, and does so for a very small sum. And the
market people and venders are quite satisfied.

This is an atom: 
It is all they expected.

This is an atom: 
* * * * *

This is an atom: 
HOMES AND HOME LIFE.

This is an atom: 
A narrow, shaded street tempts us to leave the noisy, business part
of the town and the throng that crowds these streets and plazas,
and stray into the suburbs.

This is an atom: 
No matter which way we turn, some new picture meets our eyes.

This is an atom: 
Wandering along, we peep into doorways, courtyards and pleasant patios. Some of the houses
have crosses upon their summits, to show the devotion of the inmates
to their religion.

This is an atom: 
Others have a palm branch twined among the iron bars of their balconies, or placed aloft,
to protect the house from evil. This branch was one of those blessed at the cathedral the
last Palm Sunday.

This is an atom: 
A piece of white paper floating from the iron railing of a balcony tells us that the house is to
let. Here buildings can be rented by the day or week, as well as by the month or year.

This is an atom: 
The dwellings and other buildings are of gray stone or brick, stuccoed over and tinted blue,
yellow, drab or any other color but pink.

This is an atom: 
About half the houses are two stories in height, the others one
story; but all are flat-roofed and without chimneys.

This is an atom: 
The main or upper story has iron balconies which project over the narrow streets and darken
them.

This is an atom: 
The houses have no windows of glass, but the window openings are provided with heavy shutters.
We enter these houses through interior courts or patios.

This is an atom: 
Many of the rich Puerto Ricans have fountains, trees, and flowers in these open central courts;
a few have roof gardens. Here the family sits in the evening to catch the cool sea breezes.

This is an atom: 
Others sit on their balconies along the outside of the house, or
along the inner court or patio.

This is an atom: 
The patio is the coolest place about the house during the heated hours of the day. Here the
women bring their sewing or embroidery, and chat.

This is an atom: 
It is also the favorite playground of the children, and in its shade
the men of the household take their afternoon nap.

This is an atom: 
There are no yards or gardens attached to these houses.

This is an atom: 
The only green spots to be found are the inner courts, the public squares or plazas, and the
garden of the Governor-General's palace.

This is an atom: 
There is no portion of the city set aside for the rich or the poor.

This is an atom: 
People of means, of education, and of refinement live in the upper stories. The poor live in
crowded rooms and patios, and in basements or in dirty alleys.

This is an atom: 
Many of the wealthy, fashionable people live in the pretty suburban
towns.

This is an atom: 
Others, who are engaged in business in the cities, live over their
stores, on the second floor.

This is an atom: 
The lower floors are occupied by servants, or poor people. To reach the upper stories of
these buildings, we must pass through a crowd of children, dogs, and poultry in the courtyard
below.

This is an atom: 
Upstairs the rooms are large and the ceilings lofty. The windows reach to the floor, and the
shutters are kept open to admit the air.

This is an atom: 
The homes of even the wealthy seem to us plainly furnished.

This is an atom: 
There is no upholstered furniture.
It is too warm for this, they tell us. But wood furniture, wickerwork, and willow ware are
used.

This is an atom: 
The floors in the best houses are tiled or are made of hard wood.

This is an atom: 
Carpets are never used, but rugs are seen occasionally in the center of a room.

This is an atom: 
The bedrooms are small and not well ventilated.

This is an atom: 
The beds are canopied and trimmed with fine handmade lace.

This is an atom: 
The walls are usually bare; but here and there a fine painting may be seen. Giant ferns and
broad-spreading palm leaves are used to festoon the walls and arched doorways. These are cut
fresh and renewed from day to day, and they make the dark, cool
rooms attractive and inviting.

This is an atom: 
Within and without the house, potted tropical plants are found.

This is an atom: 
Peeping into the bath room of one of these homes we see, not a bath tub, but a swimming pool
large enough to accommodate a young whale.

This is an atom: 
We think this an improvement on our bath tubs at home, and of the
joy it would give the average United States boy to add such a feature
to his own home.

This is an atom: 
FOOD AND DRINK.

This is an atom: 
For water the people have, until quite recently, been dependent upon cisterns, in which the
rain that falls upon the flat roofs is collected. These cisterns are in the patio, or
courtyard, and an open drain runs through the same place.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: THE BREAD SELLER.]
Much of the cooking is done here by the poorer people.

This is an atom: 
It seems to us that cooking in houses without chimneys would be
rather difficult, but then these people do not use stoves or coal.

This is an atom: 
They cook over a small pot, or brazier, or furnace of charcoal.

This is an atom: 
They cook less food, too, than people who live in the North. They live largely on fruits and
vegetables and have little meat.

This is an atom: 
Ice is used only by the families of the wealthy, and it is impossible
to keep milk or fresh meat for any length of time.

This is an atom: 
In place of ice-water the people store water in porous jars, and in this way it is kept
cool.

This is an atom: 
They prepare many refreshing drinks to be used in place of water by using oranges, lemons,
limes, cocoanuts, and the milk of almonds.

This is an atom: 
They also indulge very often in little ices, which the venders bring to the doors many times
a day.

This is an atom: 
The poorer people, who can not afford to indulge in such expensive
drinks and ices, use barley water, or water with toasted corn and
sugar in it.

This is an atom: 
The people have coffee or chocolate and biscuits for the first or early breakfast. The second
breakfast is eaten between eleven and twelve o'clock, and corresponds to our lunch. Dinner is
eaten at six or seven o'clock in the evening.

This is an atom: 
Many of the business men take the morning meal with their clerks
at a long table on a veranda, or in a room of the establishment.

This is an atom: 
From three to four o'clock in the afternoon everyone indulges in a siesta or nap.

This is an atom: 
Along the wharves and in the outskirts of the city, the houses are but one story high, and many of
them are built of wood.

This is an atom: 
These houses have but one window and are dark and poorly ventilated; yet they are crowded
with poor people.

This is an atom: 
Some of them have patches of garden separated by rows or hedges of cactus. Here we see brown
mothers sitting in the sun mending fish nets. Their naked little children are at play near
them.

THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO.

This is an atom: 
The people of Puerto Rico, on a casual glance, appear to us to come from every nation on
earth.

This is an atom: 
The first person you meet will be black, the next brown, the third yellow, and the fourth
white.

This is an atom: 
After a time we are able to divide them into five classes: the upper class of white Puerto Ricans;
the lower class of whites, or peasants; the negroes; the mixed people of negro and Indian or
other blood; and the foreigners.

This is an atom: 
Among these last are Germans, Swedes, Danes, Russians, Frenchmen, descendants of Moorish Jews and
of natives of the Canary Islands.

This is an atom: 
All of these people speak Spanish, however, and have the Spanish
customs, manners, and religion.

This is an atom: 
Of the 850,000 people, less than one half are colored or of mixed blood.

This is an atom: 
The upper class of white Puerto Ricans is descended from Spanish stock, and in this class are
found the wealthy planters and stock raisers, the merchants, and the professional men.

This is an atom: 
They are a happy, good-looking, hospitable, polite, and prosperous people. Many of them are
fairly well educated.

This is an atom: 
In appearance these people resemble the Cubans, having regular
features and dark hair and eyes.

This is an atom: 
The men are not large, but are well built, erect and graceful.

This is an atom: 
The women have clear complexions, delicate features, and small hands and feet.

This is an atom: 
Heavy clothing is not worn. The men dress in white (light linen or cotton), and the women in cotton
or other thin material.

This is an atom: 
The ladies of the family are secluded very closely. They spend much of their time in the
patios or on the balconies of their homes, embroidering, making lace, and gossiping. They care
little for reading or for study.

This is an atom: 
The Puerto Rican is generous and hospitable. He tells you, as does the Cuban, that his house
and all it contains, his servants, his horses, his possessions, are yours to use and to
have.

This is an atom: 
But of course he does not mean that you shall accept these gifts.

This is an atom: 
He means that he expects you to use them freely so long as you are a guest in his house.

This is an atom: 
By these well-to-do people, any sort of labor is regarded as degrading
and altogether out of the question; so they keep many servants.

This is an atom: 
Some are paid and some receive only their board and clothes. But all are content.

This is an atom: 
The working people are of one color, a light brown, with black eyes and straight hair. They are
rather small and thin; and many of those living in the cities are ill-fed and diseased.

This is an atom: 
They are ignorant and somewhat indolent, but are gentle, quick of
wit, and teachable.

This is an atom: 
Though cruel to their animals, they are kind to their children.

This is an atom: 
There are many beautiful girls in the lower classes as well as in the upper, and these we see on
the streets and in the market places.

This is an atom: 
Many of them use long scarlet shawls and wear black satin slippers
on their bare, pretty little feet.

This is an atom: 
They are as proud of their little feet as of their hands. Some of the girls in the market
have hair three-quarters the length of their body; but while it is so black and abundant,
it is extremely coarse.

This is an atom: 
The laboring men cut their hair short in the neck, and wear a thick bang on the forehead.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: A BEGGAR OF PUERTO RICO.]
In many parts of the island beggars appeal to us with outstretched
hand.

This is an atom: 
Even the little children are taught to add their mite to the family income by begging.

This is an atom: 
In Ponce these beggars secure a special license to pursue this profession and have a regular
system. In certain houses, on certain days, a little table is placed in the doorway and a
row of copper cents or coins upon it.

This is an atom: 
The beggars who are privileged to come to these homes, come at the right time, take their pennies,
and with a "Thank you!"

This is an atom: 
shamble off.

This is an atom: 
CHILD LIFE.

This is an atom: 
Formerly lessons never bothered the small Puerto Rican, or indeed any other Puerto Rican
child.
He played "hookey" all day long, and no truant officer disturbed
him, or dragged him off to school.

This is an atom: 
He never saw a schoolhouse or the inside of a schoolroom. He never saw a book. But, for that
matter, neither did his father or mother. They can neither read nor write; nor can many of
their neighbors.

This is an atom: 
The Puerto Rican city child often lives in a crowded basement, with many brothers and
sisters.

This is an atom: 
The child of poor parents in the cities is not usually very clean; but then he has very few
opportunities for bathing, and his only playground is the courtyard and the streets.

This is an atom: 
His little country cousins, who live where pools and streams are
found, spend much of their time in the water.

This is an atom: 
They find it pleasanter to paddle in cool streams, beneath overhanging tree ferns and banana
trees, than to roll in the dirt.

This is an atom: 
They object, however, to wearing clothes, and are allowed to go
without any until they are ten or twelve years of age. Even at this
age they shed briny tears when compelled to put on one cotton
garment.
These little country children learn to be helpful at a very early
age. They fish and catch crabs; weed the garden; dig potatoes;
gather fruit, vegetables and coffee; and do errands.
But they have one bugaboo, and that is the wild dog. This animal
is very fierce. It sometimes leaves its hiding place in the forest,
with a pack of companions, and carries off sheep, pigs, and calves.
If very hungry, it may attack a child; and so the children keep a
sharp lookout for it.
Children in Puerto Rico sleep on the floor or in a hammock, and
they eat whenever or wherever they can find fruit or vegetables
within their reach. Sometimes they smoke, too.
They have no toys, no books, no pictures, no fine clothes or homes;
yet, for all that, they are cheerful and contented. They have little,
but they seem to want little.
The children of the wealthy and well-to-do dress and look very much
like the children in our Southern States; though the babies and
very young children sometimes wear no clothes.
These children are sent to school, or are taught by a governess or
tutor at home, until they are old enough to be sent away to
school.
Then they are sent to Spain, France, or the United States, to
complete their education.
The girls study and read very little. It is not considered necessary
for them to be well educated.
They are not allowed to walk about the streets alone, but must have
a servant, nurse, or attendant from the time they leave their cradles
until they are married.

This is an atom: 
EDUCATION IN PUERTO RICO.
Not more than one seventh of the 850,000 people in Puerto Rico can
read or write. Only one child in twelve, between the ages of six
and sixteen, attends school. (In 1897, of 125,000 children of school
age, only about 28,000 attended school--about 19,000 boys and 9,000
girls.)
The buildings used for school purposes are seldom anything more
than thatched huts. Sometimes two or three rooms are given to the
school in the house where the teacher lives.
Many of the country districts are without schools, and no school
privileges are provided for three fourths of the people.
The schools are of the old-fashioned, ungraded, district-school
type, and are for pupils from seven to thirteen years of age.
Pupils are supposed to study arithmetic, geography, grammar, the
history of Spain, and religion.
There are few schoolbooks used. The pupils write down what the
teacher dictates, or copy what the teacher has written. The one
book they use is the one from which they learn to read.
Arithmetic problems are often worked out on the floor with bits of
clay.
There are from fifty to one hundred and twenty-five pupils in each
room, and two or three teachers.
The pupils sit on long benches or on the floor. The boys and girls
have separate schools; but the white and the colored pupils attend
the same school.
The pupils are bright and quick to learn, but there is no discipline
in the schoolroom. They come and go as they please. They stay at
home if they wish, and no truant officer disturbs them.
Many remain away from school because of a lack of clothing. Others
remain away because they prefer to play in the streets. Their parents
are careless and indifferent to the advantages of an education, and
make no effort to induce their children to attend school, or to
study.
This unfavorable state of things is soon to disappear. The United
States is now rapidly introducing schools and capable teachers into
every part of the island. The people seem very glad to take advantage
of the better order of things.

This is an atom: 
RELIGION.
The established church of the country is the Roman Catholic; but
other religions are tolerated, and a few Protestant churches are
to be found scattered over the island.
The people seem to be little interested in religion or in their
churches, and Sunday with them is only a fÃªte day or a holiday.
HOW THE PEOPLE AMUSE THEMSELVES.
The people of Puerto Rico have two hundred holidays or feast days
in their calendar. They are always ready to welcome new ones,
however, and have within the past year added Washington's birthday
and the Fourth of July to the list.
Last year they celebrated the Fourth for the first time. In all the
cities there were speeches in the daytime and fireworks at night.
In the country there were races and processions in honor of the new
"feast day," or holiday.
The people show their patriotism and loyalty to the flag of the
United States in many ways.
They are eager and quick to adopt American manners and customs.
Just before sunset, the band comes into the Plaza at Ponce and plays
the "Star Spangled Banner" in front of headquarters as the American
flag is drawn down for the night.
The Puerto Ricans noticed that the American men took off their hats
and stood with uncovered heads while the flag made its descent; and
now they, too, show their loyalty by doffing their hats when the
flag comes down.
The people of Puerto Rico are extremely fond of music. Strolling
bands of guitar and mandolin players are numerous; and at evening
time the air is filled with music.
Each peasant makes his own guitar. It is a very curious instrument.
This guitar music is usually accompanied by music from another
instrument called a guida. This is made from the great curve-necked
gourd. The music or sound is made by passing a piece of umbrella
wire up and down a series of notches cut from end to end on the
outside curve of the gourd.
The sound produced is much like that made by rubbing together two
pieces of sandpaper. We would not call it music at all, but the
natives seem to like it. No orchestra is complete without it, and
one can hear the scratching of this instrument almost any time, at
any home in Puerto Rico."Yes, if I may. If you will let me pray for you."

This is an atom: 
"Certainly, my dear. My dear Ruth, you don't know how often I sin; I do so wrong, with my few
temptations. We are both of us great sinners in the eyes of the Most Holy; let us pray for
each other. Don't speak so again, my dear; at least, not to me!"

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson was actually crying. She had always looked upon herself as so inferior to her brother
in real goodness; had seen such heights above her, that she was distressed by Ruth's humility.
After a short time she resumed the subject.

This is an atom: 
"Then I may get you a black gown?--and we may call you Mrs Hilton?"

This is an atom: 
"No; not Mrs Hilton!" said Ruth, hastily.

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson, who had hitherto kept her eyes averted from Ruth's face from a motive of kindly
delicacy, now looked at her with surprise.

This is an atom: 
"Why not?" asked she.

This is an atom: 
"It was my mother's name," said Ruth, in a low voice. "I had better not be called by it."

This is an atom: 
"Then, let us call you by my mother's name," said Miss Benson, tenderly. "She would have--
But I'll talk to you about my mother some other time. Let me call you Mrs Denbigh. It will
do very well, too. People will think you are a distant relation."

This is an atom: 
When she told Mr Benson this choice of name, he was rather sorry; it was like his sister's
impulsive kindness--impulsive in everything--and he could imagine how Ruth's humility had touched
her. He was sorry, but he said nothing.

This is an atom: 
And now the letter was written home, announcing the probable arrival of the brother and sister
on a certain day, "with a distant relation, early left a widow," as Miss Benson expressed it.
She desired the spare room might be prepared, and made every provision she could think of for
Ruth's comfort; for Ruth still remained feeble and weak.

This is an atom: 
When the black gown, at which she had stitched away incessantly, was finished--when nothing
remained but to rest for the next day's journey--Ruth could not sit still. She wandered from
window to window, learning off each rock and tree by heart. Each had its tale, which it was
agony to remember; but which it would have been worse agony to forget. The sound of running
waters she heard that quiet evening, was in her ears as she lay on her death-bed; so well had
she learnt their tune.

This is an atom: 
And now all was over. She had driven in to Llan-dhu, sitting by her lover's side, living in
the bright present, and strangely forgetful of the past or the future; she had dreamed out
her dream, and she had awakened from the vision of love. She walked slowly and sadly down the
long hill, her tears fast falling, but as quickly wiped away; while she strove to make steady
the low quivering voice which was often called upon to answer some remark of Miss Benson's.

This is an atom: 
They had to wait for the coach. Ruth buried her face in some flowers which Mrs Hughes had given
her on parting; and was startled when the mail drew up with a sudden pull, which almost threw
the horses on their haunches. She was placed inside, and the coach had set off again, before
she was fully aware that Mr and Miss Benson were travelling on the outside; but it was a relief
to feel she might now cry without exciting their notice. The shadow of a heavy thunder-cloud
was on the valley, but the little upland village church (that showed the spot in which so much
of her life had passed) stood out clear in the sunshine. She grudged the tears that blinded
her as she gazed. There was one passenger, who tried after a while to comfort her.

This is an atom: 
"Don't cry, miss," said the kind-hearted woman. "You're parting from friends, maybe? Well,
that's bad enough, but when you come to my age, you'll think none of it. Why, I've three sons,
and they're soldiers and sailors, all of them--here, there, and everywhere. One is in America,
beyond seas; another is in China, making tea; and another is at Gibraltar, three miles from
Spain; and yet, you see, I can laugh and eat and enjoy myself. I sometimes think I'll try and
fret a bit, just to make myself a better figure; but, Lord! it's no use, it's against my nature;
so I laugh and grow fat again. I'd be quite thankful for a fit of anxiety as would make me
feel easy in my clothes, which them manty-makers will make so tight I'm fairly throttled."

This is an atom: 
Ruth durst cry no more; it was no relief, now she was watched and noticed, and plied with a
sandwich or a gingerbread each time she looked sad. She lay back with her eyes shut, as if
asleep, and went on, and on, the sun never seeming to move from his high place in the sky,
nor the bright hot day to show the least sign of waning. Every now and then, Miss Benson scrambled
down, and made kind inquiries of the pale, weary Ruth; and once they changed coaches, and the
fat old lady left her with a hearty shake of the hand.

This is an atom: 
"It is not much further now," said Miss Benson, apologetically, to Ruth. "See! we are losing
sight of the Welsh mountains. We have about eighteen miles of plain, and then we come to the
moors and the rising ground, amidst which Eccleston lies. I wish we were there, for my brother
is sadly tired."

This is an atom: 
The first wonder in Ruth's mind was, why then, if Mr Benson were so tired, did they not stop
where they were for the night; for she knew little of the expenses of a night at an inn. The
next thought was, to beg that Mr Benson would take her place inside the coach, and allow her
to mount up by Miss Benson. She proposed this, and Miss Benson was evidently pleased.

This is an atom: 
"Well, if you're not tired, it would make a rest and a change for him, to be sure; and if you
were by me I could show you the first sight of Eccleston, if we reach there before it is quite
dark."

This is an atom: 
So Mr Benson got down, and changed places with Ruth.

This is an atom: 
She hardly yet understood the numerous small economies which he and his sister had to practise--the
little daily self-denials,--all endured so cheerfully, and simply, that they had almost ceased
to require an effort, and it had become natural to them to think of others before themselves.
Ruth had not understood that it was for economy that their places had been taken on the outside
of the coach, while hers, as an invalid requiring rest, was to be the inside; and that the
biscuits which supplied the place of a dinner were, in fact, chosen because the difference
in price between the two would go a little way towards fulfilling their plan for receiving
her as an inmate. Her thought about money had been hitherto a child's thought; the subject
had never touched her; but afterwards, when she had lived a little with the Bensons, her eyes
were opened, and she remembered their simple kindness on the journey, and treasured the remembrance
of it in her heart.

This is an atom: 
A low grey cloud was the first sign of Eccleston; it was the smoke of the town hanging over
the plain. Beyond the place where she was expected to believe it existed, arose round, waving
uplands; nothing to the fine outlines of the Welsh mountains, but still going up nearer to
heaven than the rest of the flat world into which she had now entered. Rumbling stones, lamp-posts,
a sudden stop, and they were in the town of Eccleston; and a strange, uncouth voice, on the
dark side of the coach, was heard to say,

This is an atom: 
"Be ye there, measter?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, yes!" said Miss Benson, quickly. "Did Sally send you, Ben? Get the ostler's lantern,
and look out the luggage."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XIII

This is an atom: 
The Dissenting Minister's Household

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson had resumed every morsel of the briskness which she had rather lost in the middle
of the day; her foot was on her native stones, and a very rough set they were, and she was
near her home and among known people. Even Mr Benson spoke very cheerfully to Ben, and made
many inquiries of him respecting people whose names were strange to Ruth. She was cold, and
utterly weary. She took Miss Benson's offered arm, and could hardly drag herself as far as
the little quiet street in which Mr Benson's house was situated. The street was so quiet that
their footsteps sounded like a loud disturbance, and announced their approach as effectually
as the "trumpet's lordly blare" did the coming of Abdallah. A door flew open, and a lighted
passage stood before them. As soon as they had entered, a stout, elderly servant emerged from
behind the door, her face radiant with welcome.

This is an atom: 
"Eh, bless ye! are ye back again? I thought I should ha' been lost without ye."

This is an atom: 
She gave Mr Benson a hearty shake of the hand, and kissed Miss Benson warmly; then, turning
to Ruth, she said, in a loud whisper,

This is an atom: 
"Who's yon?"

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson was silent, and walked a step onwards. Miss Benson said boldly out,

This is an atom: 
"The lady I named in my note, Sally--Mrs Denbigh, a distant relation."

This is an atom: 
"Aye, but you said hoo was a widow. Is this chit a widow?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, this is Mrs Denbigh," answered Miss Benson.

This is an atom: 
"If I'd been her mother, I'd ha' given her a lollypop instead of a husband. Hoo looks fitter
for it."

This is an atom: 
"Hush! Sally, Sally! Look, there's your master trying to move that heavy box." Miss Benson
calculated well when she called Sally's attention to her master; for it was well believed by
every one, and by Sally herself, that his deformity was owing to a fall he had had when he
was scarcely more than a baby, and entrusted to her care--a little nurse-girl, as she then
was, not many years older than himself. For years the poor girl had cried herself to sleep
on her pallet-bed, moaning over the blight her carelessness had brought upon her darling; nor
was this self-reproach diminished by the forgiveness of the gentle mother, from whom Thurstan
Benson derived so much of his character. The way in which comfort stole into Sally's heart
was in the gradually-formed resolution that she would never leave him nor forsake him, but
serve him faithfully all her life long; and she had kept to her word. She loved Miss Benson,
but she almost worshipped the brother. The reverence for him was in her heart, however, and
did not always show itself in her manners. But if she scolded him herself, she allowed no one
else that privilege. If Miss Benson differed from her brother, and ventured to think his sayings
or doings might have been improved, Sally came down upon her like a thunder-clap.

This is an atom: 
"My goodness gracious, Master Thurstan, when will you learn to leave off meddling with other
folks' business! Here, Ben! help me up with these trunks."

This is an atom: 
The little narrow passage was cleared, and Miss Benson took Ruth into the sitting-room. There
were only two sitting-rooms on the ground-floor, one behind the other. Out of the back room
the kitchen opened, and for this reason the back parlour was used as the family sitting-room;
or else, being, with its garden aspect, so much the pleasanter of the two, both Sally and Miss
Benson would have appropriated it for Mr Benson's study. As it was, the front room, which looked
to the street, was his room; and many a person coming for help--help of which giving money
was the lowest kind--was admitted, and let forth by Mr Benson, unknown to any one else in the
house. To make amends for his having the least cheerful room on the ground-floor, he had the
garden bedroom, while his sister slept over his study. There were two more rooms again over
these, with sloping ceilings, though otherwise large and airy. The attic looking into the garden
was the spare bedroom; while the front belonged to Sally. There was no room over the kitchen,
which was, in fact, a supplement to the house. The sitting-room was called by the pretty, old-fashioned
name of the parlour, while Mr Benson's room was styled the study.

This is an atom: 
The curtains were drawn in the parlour; there was a bright fire and a clean hearth; indeed,
exquisite cleanliness seemed the very spirit of the household, for the door which was open
to the kitchen showed a delicately-white and spotless floor, and bright glittering tins, on
which the ruddy firelight danced.

This is an atom: 
From the place in which Ruth sat she could see all Sally's movements; and though she was not
conscious of close or minute observation at the time (her body being weary, and her mind full
of other thoughts), yet it was curious how faithfully that scene remained depicted on her memory
in after years. The warm light filled every corner of the kitchen, in strong distinction to
the faint illumination of the one candle in the parlour, whose radiance was confined, and was
lost in the dead folds of window-curtains, carpet, and furniture. The square, stout, bustling
figure, neat and clean in every respect, but dressed in the peculiar, old-fashioned costume
of the county, namely, a dark-striped linsey-woolsey petticoat, made very short, displaying
sturdy legs in woollen stockings beneath; a loose kind of jacket called there a "bedgown,"
made of pink print; a snow-white apron and cap, both of linen, and the latter made in the shape
of a "mutch;"--these articles completed Sally's costume, and were painted on Ruth's memory.
Whilst Sally was busied in preparing tea, Miss Benson took off Ruth's things; and the latter
instinctively felt that Sally, in the midst of her movements, was watching their proceedings.
Occasionally she also put in a word in the conversation, and these little sentences were uttered
quite in the tone of an equal, if not of a superior. She had dropped the more formal "you,"
with which at first she had addressed Miss Benson, and thou'd her quietly and habitually.

This is an atom: 
All these particulars sank unconsciously into Ruth's mind; but they did not rise to the surface,
and become perceptible, for a length of time. She was weary, and much depressed. Even the very
kindness that ministered to her was overpowering. But over the dark, misty moor a little light
shone,--a beacon; and on that she fixed her eyes, and struggled out of her present deep dejection--the
little child that was coming to her!

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson was as languid and weary as Ruth, and was silent during all this bustle and preparation.
His silence was more grateful to Ruth than Miss Benson's many words, although she felt their
kindness. After tea, Miss Benson took her upstairs to her room. The white dimity bed, and the
walls, stained green, had something of the colouring and purity of effect of a snowdrop; while
the floor, rubbed with a mixture that turned it into a rich dark brown, suggested the idea
of the garden-mould out of which the snowdrop grows. As Miss Benson helped the pale Ruth to
undress, her voice became less full-toned and hurried; the hush of approaching night subdued
her into a softened, solemn kind of tenderness, and the murmured blessing sounded like granted
prayer.

This is an atom: 
When Miss Benson came downstairs, she found her brother reading some letters which had been
received during his absence. She went and softly shut the door of communication between the
parlour and the kitchen; and then, fetching a grey worsted stocking which she was knitting,
sat down near him, her eyes not looking at her work but fixed on the fire; while the eternal
rapid click of the knitting-needles broke the silence of the room, with a sound as monotonous
and incessant as the noise of a hand-loom. She expected him to speak, but he did not. She enjoyed
an examination into, and discussion of, her feelings; it was an interest and amusement to her,
while he dreaded and avoided all such conversation. There were times when his feelings, which
were always earnest, and sometimes morbid, burst forth, and defied control, and overwhelmed
him; when a force was upon him compelling him to speak. But he, in general, strove to preserve
his composure, from a fear of the compelling pain of such times, and the consequent exhaustion.
His heart had been very full of Ruth all day long, and he was afraid of his sister beginning
the subject; so he read on, or seemed to do so, though he hardly saw the letter he held before
him. It was a great relief to him when Sally threw open the middle door with a bang, which
did not indicate either calmness of mind or sweetness of temper.

This is an atom: 
"Is yon young woman going to stay any length o' time with us?" asked she of Miss Benson.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson put his hand gently on his sister's arm, to check her from making any reply, while
he said,

This is an atom: 
"We cannot exactly tell, Sally. She will remain until after her confinement."

This is an atom: 
"Lord bless us and save us!--a baby in the house! Nay, then my time's come, and I'll pack up
and begone. I never could abide them things. I'd sooner have rats in the house."

This is an atom: 
Sally really did look alarmed.

This is an atom: 
"Why, Sally!" said Mr Benson, smiling, "I was not much more than a baby when you came to take
care of me."

This is an atom: 
"Yes, you were, Master Thurstan; you were a fine bouncing lad of three year old and better."

This is an atom: 
Then she remembered the change she had wrought in the "fine bouncing lad," and her eyes filled
with tears, which she was too proud to wipe away with her apron; for, as she sometimes said
to herself, "she could not abide crying before folk."

This is an atom: 
"Well, it's no use talking, Sally," said Miss Benson, too anxious to speak to be any longer
repressed. "We've promised to keep her, and we must do it; you'll have none of the trouble,
Sally, so don't be afraid."

This is an atom: 
"Well, I never! as if I minded trouble! You might ha' known me better nor that. I've scoured
master's room twice over, just to make the boards look white, though the carpet is to cover
them, and now you go and cast up about me minding my trouble. If them's the fashions you've
learnt in Wales, I'm thankful I've never been there."

This is an atom: 
Sally looked red, indignant, and really hurt. Mr Benson came in with his musical voice and
soft words of healing.

This is an atom: 
"Faith knows you don't care for trouble, Sally; she is only anxious about this poor young woman,
who has no friends but ourselves. We know there will be more trouble in consequence of her
coming to stay with us; and I think, though we never spoke about it, that in making our plans
we reckoned on your kind help, Sally, which has never failed us yet when we needed it."

This is an atom: 
"You've twice the sense of your sister, Master Thurstan, that you have. Boys always has. It's
truth there will be more trouble, and I shall have my share on't, I reckon. I can face it if
I'm told out and out, but I cannot abide the way some folk has of denying there's trouble or
pain to be met; just as if their saying there was none, would do away with it. Some folk treats
one like a babby, and I don't like it. I'm not meaning _you_, Master Thurstan."

This is an atom: 
"No, Sally, you need not say that. I know well enough who you mean when you say 'some folk.'
However, I admit I was wrong in speaking as if you minded trouble, for there never was a creature
minded it less. But I want you to like Mrs Denbigh," said Miss Benson.

This is an atom: 
"I dare say I should, if you'd let me alone. I did na like her sitting down in master's chair.
Set her up, indeed, in an arm-chair wi' cushions! Wenches in my day were glad enough of stools."

This is an atom: 
"She was tired to-night," said Mr Benson. "We are all tired; so if you have done your work,
Sally, come in to reading."

This is an atom: 
The three quiet people knelt down side by side, and two of them prayed earnestly for "them
that had gone astray." Before ten o'clock, the household were in bed.

This is an atom: 
Ruth, sleepless, weary, restless with the oppression of a sorrow which she dared not face and
contemplate bravely, kept awake all the early part of the night. Many a time did she rise,
and go to the long casement window, and look abroad over the still and quiet town--over the
grey stone walls, and chimneys, and old high-pointed roofs--on to the far-away hilly line of
the horizon, lying calm under the bright moonshine. It was late in the morning when she woke
from her long-deferred slumbers; and when she went downstairs, she found Mr and Miss Benson
awaiting her in the parlour. That homely, pretty, old-fashioned little room! How bright and
still and clean it looked! The window (all the windows at the back of the house were casements)
was open, to let in the sweet morning air, and streaming eastern sunshine. The long jessamine
sprays, with their white-scented stars, forced themselves almost into the room. The little
square garden beyond, with grey stone walls all round, was rich and mellow in its autumnal
colouring, running from deep crimson hollyhocks up to amber and gold nasturtiums, and all toned
down by the clear and delicate air. It was so still, that the gossamer-webs, laden with dew,
did not tremble or quiver in the least; but the sun was drawing to himself the sweet incense
of many flowers, and the parlour was scented with the odours of mignonette and stocks. Miss
Benson was arranging a bunch of China and damask roses in an old-fashioned jar; they lay, all
dewy and fresh, on the white breakfast-cloth when Ruth entered. Mr Benson was reading in some
large folio. With gentle morning speech they greeted her; but the quiet repose of the scene
was instantly broken by Sally popping in from the kitchen, and glancing at Ruth with sharp
reproach. She said:

This is an atom: 
"I reckon I may bring in breakfast, now?" with a strong emphasis on the last word.

This is an atom: 
"I am afraid I am very late," said Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, never mind," said Mr Benson, gently. "It was our fault for not telling you our breakfast
hour. We always have prayers at half-past seven; and, for Sally's sake, we never vary from
that time; for she can so arrange her work, if she knows the hour of prayers, as to have her
mind calm and untroubled."

This is an atom: 
"Ahem!" said Miss Benson, rather inclined to "testify" against the invariable calmness of Sally's
mind at any hour of the day; but her brother went on as if he did not hear her.

This is an atom: 
"But the breakfast does not signify being delayed a little; and I am sure you were sadly tired
with your long day yesterday."

This is an atom: 
Sally came slapping in, and put down some withered, tough, dry toast, with--

This is an atom: 
"It's not my doing if it is like leather;" but as no one appeared to hear her, she withdrew
to her kitchen, leaving Ruth's cheeks like crimson at the annoyance she had caused.

This is an atom: 
All day long, she had that feeling common to those who go to stay at a fresh house among comparative
strangers: a feeling of the necessity that she should become accustomed to the new atmosphere
in which she was placed, before she could move and act freely; it was, indeed, a purer ether,
a diviner air, which she was breathing in now, than what she had been accustomed to for long
months. The gentle, blessed mother, who had made her childhood's home holy ground, was in her
very nature so far removed from any of earth's stains and temptations, that she seemed truly
one of those

This is an atom: 
Who ask not if Thine eye
   Be on them; who, in love and truth,
   Where no misgiving is, rely
   Upon the genial sense of youth.

This is an atom: 
In the Bensons' house there was the same unconsciousness of individual merit, the same absence
of introspection and analysis of motive, as there had been in her mother; but it seemed that
their lives were pure and good, not merely from a lovely and beautiful nature, but from some
law, the obedience to which was, of itself, harmonious peace, and which governed them almost
implicitly, and with as little questioning on their part, as the glorious stars which haste
not, rest not, in their eternal obedience. This household had many failings: they were but
human, and, with all their loving desire to bring their lives into harmony with the will of
God, they often erred and fell short; but, somehow, the very errors and faults of one individual
served to call out higher excellences in another, and so they reacted upon each other, and
the result of short discords was exceeding harmony and peace. But they had themselves no idea
of the real state of things; they did not trouble themselves with marking their progress by
self-examination; if Mr Benson did sometimes, in hours of sick incapacity for exertion, turn
inwards, it was to cry aloud with almost morbid despair, "God be merciful to me a sinner!"
But he strove to leave his life in the hands of God, and to forget himself.

This is an atom: 
Ruth sat still and quiet through the long first day. She was languid and weary from her journey;
she was uncertain what help she might offer to give in the household duties, and what she might
not. And, in her languor and in her uncertainty, it was pleasant to watch the new ways of the
people among whom she was placed. After breakfast, Mr Benson withdrew to his study, Miss Benson
took away the cups and saucers, and, leaving the kitchen door open, talked sometimes to Ruth,
sometimes to Sally, while she washed them up. Sally had upstairs duties to perform, for which
Ruth was thankful, as she kept receiving rather angry glances for her unpunctuality as long
as Sally remained downstairs. Miss Benson assisted in the preparation for the early dinner,
and brought some kidney-beans to shred into a basin of bright, pure spring-water, which caught
and danced in the sunbeams as she sat near the open casement of the parlour, talking to Ruth
of things and people which as yet the latter did not understand, and could not arrange and
comprehend. She was like a child who gets a few pieces of a dissected map, and is confused
until a glimpse of the whole unity is shown him. Mr and Mrs Bradshaw were the centre pieces
in Ruth's map; their children, their servants, were the accessories; and one or two other names
were occasionally mentioned. Ruth wondered and almost wearied at Miss Benson's perseverance
in talking to her about people whom she did not know; but, in truth, Miss Benson heard the
long-drawn, quivering sighs which came from the poor heavy heart, when it was left to silence,
and had leisure to review the past; and her quick accustomed ear caught also the low mutterings
of the thunder in the distance, in the shape of Sally's soliloquies, which, like the asides
at a theatre, were intended to be heard. Suddenly, Miss Benson called Ruth out of the room,
upstairs into her own bed-chamber, and then began rummaging in little old-fashioned boxes,
drawn out of an equally old-fashioned bureau, half desk, half table, and wholly drawers.

This is an atom: 
"My dear, I've been very stupid and thoughtless. Oh! I'm so glad I thought of it before Mrs
Bradshaw came to call. Here it is!" and she pulled out an old wedding-ring, and hurried it
on Ruth's finger. Ruth hung down her head, and reddened deep with shame; her eyes smarted with
the hot tears that filled them. Miss Benson talked on, in a nervous hurried way:

This is an atom: 
"It was my grandmother's; it's very broad; they made them so then, to hold a posy inside: there's
one in that;

This is an atom: 
Thine own sweetheart
   Till death doth part,

This is an atom: 
I think it is. There, there! Run away, and look as if you'd always worn it."

This is an atom: 
Ruth went up to her room, and threw herself down on her knees by the bedside, and cried as
if her heart would break; and then, as if a light had come down into her soul, she calmed herself
and prayed--no words can tell how humbly, and with what earnest feeling. When she came down,
she was tear-stained and wretchedly pale; but even Sally looked at her with new eyes, because
of the dignity with which she was invested by an earnestness of purpose which had her child
for its object. She sat and thought, but she no longer heaved those bitter sighs which had
wrung Miss Benson's heart in the morning. In this way the day wore on; early dinner, early
tea, seemed to make it preternaturally long to Ruth; the only event was some unexplained absence
of Sally's, who had disappeared out of the house in the evening, much to Miss Benson's surprise,
and somewhat to her indignation.

This is an atom: 
At night, after Ruth had gone up to her room, this absence was explained to her at least. She
had let down her long waving glossy hair, and was standing absorbed in thought in the middle
of the room, when she heard a round clumping knock at her door, different from that given by
the small knuckles of delicate fingers, and in walked Sally, with a judge-like severity of
demeanour, holding in her hand two widow's caps of commonest make and coarsest texture. Queen
Eleanor herself, when she presented the bowl to Fair Rosamond, had not a more relentless purpose
stamped on her demeanour than had Sally at this moment. She walked up to the beautiful, astonished
Ruth, where she stood in her long, soft, white dressing-gown, with all her luxuriant brown
hair hanging dishevelled down her figure, and thus Sally spoke:

This is an atom: 
"Missus--or miss, as the case may be--I've my doubts as to you. I'm not going to have my master
and Miss Faith put upon, or shame come near them. Widows wears these sort o' caps, and has
their hair cut off; and whether widows wears wedding-rings or not, they shall have their hair
cut off--they shall. I'll have no half work in this house. I've lived with the family forty-nine
year come Michaelmas, and I'll not see it disgraced by any one's fine long curls. Sit down
and let me snip off your hair, and let me see you sham decently in a widow's cap to-morrow,
or I'll leave the house. Whatten's come over Miss Faith, as used to be as mim a lady as ever
was, to be taken by such as you, I dunnot know. Here! sit down with ye, and let me crop you."

This is an atom: 
She laid no light hand on Ruth's shoulder; and the latter, partly intimidated by the old servant,
who had hitherto only turned her vixen lining to observation, and partly because she was broken-spirited
enough to be indifferent to the measure proposed, quietly sat down. Sally produced the formidable
pair of scissors that always hung at her side, and began to cut in a merciless manner. She
expected some remonstrance or some opposition, and had a torrent of words ready to flow forth
at the least sign of rebellion; but Ruth was still and silent, with meekly-bowed head, under
the strange hands that were shearing her beautiful hair into the clipped shortness of a boy's.
Long before she had finished, Sally had some slight misgivings as to the fancied necessity
of her task; but it was too late, for half the curls were gone, and the rest must now come
off. When she had done, she lifted up Ruth's face by placing her hand under the round white
chin. She gazed into the countenance, expecting to read some anger there, though it had not
come out in words; but she only met the large, quiet eyes, that looked at her with sad gentleness
out of their finely-hollowed orbits. Ruth's soft, yet dignified submission, touched Sally with
compunction, though she did not choose to show the change in her feelings. She tried to hide
it, indeed, by stooping to pick up the long bright tresses; and, holding them up admiringly,
and letting them drop down and float on the air (like the pendant branches of the weeping birch),
she said: "I thought we should ha' had some crying--I did. They're pretty curls enough; you've
not been so bad to let them be cut off neither. You see, Master Thurstan is no wiser than a
babby in some things; and Miss Faith just lets him have his own way; so it's all left to me
to keep him out of scrapes. I'll wish you a very good night. I've heard many a one say as long
hair was not wholesome. Good night."

This is an atom: 
But in a minute she popped her head into Ruth's room once more:

This is an atom: 
"You'll put on them caps to-morrow morning. I'll make you a present on them."

This is an atom: 
Sally had carried away the beautiful curls, and she could not find it in her heart to throw
such lovely chestnut tresses away, so she folded them up carefully in paper, and placed them
in a safe corner of her drawer.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XIV

This is an atom: 
Ruth's First Sunday at Eccleston

This is an atom: 
Ruth felt very shy when she came down (at half-past seven) the next morning, in her widow's
cap. Her smooth, pale face, with its oval untouched by time, looked more young and childlike
than ever, when contrasted with the head-gear usually associated with ideas of age. She blushed
very deeply as Mr and Miss Benson showed the astonishment, which they could not conceal, in
their looks. She said in a low voice to Miss Benson,

This is an atom: 
"Sally thought I had better wear it."

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson made no reply; but was startled at the intelligence, which she thought was conveyed
in this speech, of Sally's acquaintance with Ruth's real situation. She noticed Sally's looks
particularly this morning. The manner in which the old servant treated Ruth had in it far more
of respect than there had been the day before; but there was a kind of satisfied way of braving
out Miss Benson's glances which made the latter uncertain and uncomfortable.

This is an atom: 
She followed her brother into his study.

This is an atom: 
"Do you know, Thurstan, I am almost certain Sally suspects."

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson sighed. The deception grieved him, and yet he thought he saw its necessity.

This is an atom: 
"What makes you think so?" asked he.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! many little things. It was her odd way of ducking her head about, as if to catch a good
view of Ruth's left hand, that made me think of the wedding-ring; and once, yesterday, when
I thought I had made up quite a natural speech, and was saying how sad it was for so young
a creature to be left a widow, she broke in with 'widow be farred!' in a very strange, contemptuous
kind of manner."

This is an atom: 
"If she suspects, we had far better tell her the truth at once. She will never rest till she
finds it out, so we must make a virtue of necessity."

This is an atom: 
"Well, brother, you shall tell her then, for I am sure I daren't. I don't mind doing the thing,
since you talked to me that day, and since I've got to know Ruth; but I do mind all the clatter
people will make about it."

This is an atom: 
"But Sally is not 'people.'"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, I see it must be done; she'll talk as much as all the other persons put together, so that's
the reason I call her 'people.' Shall I call her?" (For the house was too homely and primitive
to have bells.)

This is an atom: 
Sally came, fully aware of what was now going to be told her, and determined not to help them
out in telling their awkward secret, by understanding the nature of it before it was put into
the plainest language. In every pause, when they hoped she had caught the meaning they were
hinting at, she persisted in looking stupid and perplexed, and in saying, "Well," as if quite
unenlightened as to the end of the story. When it was all complete and plain before her, she
said, honestly enough,

This is an atom: 
"It's just as I thought it was; and I think you may thank me for having had the sense to put
her into widow's caps, and clip off that bonny brown hair that was fitter for a bride in lawful
matrimony than for such as her. She took it very well, though. She was as quiet as a lamb,
and I clipped her pretty roughly at first. I must say, though, if I'd ha' known who your visitor
was, I'd ha' packed up my things and cleared myself out of the house before such as her came
into it. As it's done, I suppose I must stand by you, and help you through with it; I only
hope I shan't lose my character,--and me a parish clerk's daughter."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Sally! people know you too well to think any ill of you," said Miss Benson, who was pleased
to find the difficulty so easily got over; for, in truth, Sally had been much softened by the
unresisting gentleness with which Ruth had submitted to the "clipping" of the night before.

This is an atom: 
"If I'd been with you, Master Thurstan, I'd ha' seen sharp after you, for you're always picking
up some one or another as nobody else would touch with a pair of tongs. Why, there was that
Nelly Brandon's child as was left at our door, if I hadn't gone to th' overseer we should have
had that Irish tramp's babby saddled on us for life; but I went off and told th' overseer,
and th' mother was caught."

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said Mr Benson, sadly, "and I often lie awake and wonder what is the fate of that poor
little thing, forced back on the mother who tried to get quit of it. I often doubt whether
I did right; but it's no use thinking about it now."

This is an atom: 
"I'm thankful it isn't," said Sally; "and now, if we've talked doctrine long enough, I'll go
make th' beds. Yon girl's secret is safe enough for me."

This is an atom: 
Saying this she left the room, and Miss Benson followed. She found Ruth busy washing the breakfast
things; and they were done in so quiet and orderly a manner, that neither Miss Benson nor Sally,
both particular enough, had any of their little fancies or prejudices annoyed. She seemed to
have an instinctive knowledge of the exact period when her help was likely to become a hindrance,
and withdrew from the busy kitchen just at the right time.

This is an atom: 
That afternoon, as Miss Benson and Ruth sat at their work, Mrs and Miss Bradshaw called. Miss
Benson was so nervous as to surprise Ruth, who did not understand the probable and possible
questions which might be asked respecting any visitor at the minister's house. Ruth went on
sewing, absorbed in her own thoughts, and glad that the conversation between the two elder
ladies and the silence of the younger one, who sat at some distance from her, gave her an opportunity
of retreating into the haunts of memory; and soon the work fell from her hands, and her eyes
were fixed on the little garden beyond, but she did not see its flowers or its walls; she saw
the mountains which girdled Llan-dhu, and saw the sun rise from behind their iron outline,
just as it had done--how long ago? was it months or was it years?--since she had watched the
night through, crouched up at _his_ door. Which was the dream and which the reality? that distant
life, or this? His moans rang more clearly in her ears than the buzzing of the conversation
between Mrs Bradshaw and Miss Benson.

This is an atom: 
At length the subdued, scared-looking little lady and her bright-eyed silent daughter rose
to take leave; Ruth started into the present, and stood up and curtseyed, and turned sick at
heart with sudden recollection.

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson accompanied Mrs Bradshaw to the door; and in the passage gave her a long explanation
of Ruth's (fictitious) history. Mrs Bradshaw looked so much interested and pleased, that Miss
Benson enlarged a little more than was necessary, and rounded off her invention with one or
two imaginary details, which, she was quite unconscious, were overheard by her brother through
the half-open study door.

This is an atom: 
She was rather dismayed when he called her into his room after Mrs Bradshaw's departure, and
asked her what she had been saying about Ruth?

This is an atom: 
"Oh! I thought it was better to explain it thoroughly--I mean, to tell the story we wished
to have believed once for all--you know we agreed about that, Thurstan?" deprecatingly.

This is an atom: 
"Yes; but I heard you saying you believed her husband had been a young surgeon, did I not?"

This is an atom: 
"Well, Thurstan, you know he must have been something; and young surgeons are so in the way
of dying, it seemed very natural. Besides," said she, with sudden boldness, "I do think I've
a talent for fiction, it is so pleasant to invent, and make the incidents dovetail together;
and after all, if we are to tell a lie, we may as well do it thoroughly, or else it's of no
use. A bungling lie would be worse than useless. And, Thurstan--it may be very wrong--but I
believe--I am afraid I enjoy not being fettered by truth. Don't look so grave. You know it
is necessary, if ever it was, to tell falsehoods now; and don't be angry with me because I
do it well."

This is an atom: 
He was shading his eyes with his hand, and did not speak for some time. At last he said:

This is an atom: 
"If it were not for the child, I would tell all; but the world is so cruel. You don't know
how this apparent necessity for falsehood pains me, Faith, or you would not invent all these
details, which are so many additional lies."

This is an atom: 
"Well, well! I will restrain myself if I have to talk about Ruth again. But Mrs Bradshaw will
tell every one who need to know. You don't wish me to contradict it, Thurstan, surely--it was
such a pretty, probable story."

This is an atom: 
"Faith! I hope God will forgive us if we are doing wrong; and pray, dear, don't add one unnecessary
word that is not true."

This is an atom: 
Another day elapsed, and then it was Sunday; and the house seemed filled with a deep peace.
Even Sally's movements were less hasty and abrupt. Mr Benson seemed invested with a new dignity,
which made his bodily deformity be forgotten in his calm, grave composure of spirit. Every
trace of week-day occupation was put away; the night before, a bright new handsome tablecloth
had been smoothed down over the table, and the jars had been freshly filled with flowers. Sunday
was a festival and a holy day in the house. After the very early breakfast, little feet pattered
into Mr Benson's study, for he had a class for boys--a sort of domestic Sunday-school, only
that there was more talking between teacher and pupils, than dry, absolute lessons going on.
Miss Benson, too, had her little, neat-tippeted maidens sitting with her in the parlour; and
she was far more particular in keeping them to their reading and spelling, than her brother
was with his boys. Sally, too, put in her word of instruction from the kitchen, helping, as
she fancied, though her assistance was often rather _malapropos_; for instance, she called
out, to a little fat, stupid, roly-poly girl, to whom Miss Benson was busy explaining the meaning
of the word quadruped,

This is an atom: 
"Quadruped, a thing wi' four legs, Jenny; a chair is a quadruped, child!"

This is an atom: 
But Miss Benson had a deaf manner sometimes when her patience was not too severely tried, and
she put it on now. Ruth sat on a low hassock, and coaxed the least of the little creatures
to her, and showed it pictures till it fell asleep in her arms, and sent a thrill through her,
at the thought of the tiny darling who would lie on her breast before long, and whom she would
have to cherish and to shelter from the storms of the world.

This is an atom: 
And then she remembered, that she was once white and sinless as the wee lassie who lay in her
arms; and she knew that she had gone astray. By-and-by the children trooped away, and Miss
Benson summoned her to put on her things for chapel.

This is an atom: 
The chapel was up a narrow street, or rather _cul-de-sac_, close by. It stood on the outskirts
of the town, almost in fields. It was built about the time of Matthew and Philip Henry, when
the Dissenters were afraid of attracting attention or observation, and hid their places of
worship in obscure and out-of-the-way parts of the towns in which they were built. Accordingly,
it often happened, as in the present case, that the buildings immediately surrounding, as well
as the chapels themselves, looked as if they carried you back to a period a hundred and fifty
years ago. The chapel had a picturesque and old-world look, for luckily the congregation had
been too poor to rebuild it, or new-face it, in George the Third's time. The staircases which
led to the galleries were outside, at each end of the building, and the irregular roof and
worn stone steps looked grey and stained by time and weather. The grassy hillocks, each with
a little upright headstone, were shaded by a grand old wych-elm. A lilac-bush or two, a white
rose-tree, and a few laburnums, all old and gnarled enough, were planted round the chapel yard;
and the casement windows of the chapel were made of heavy-leaded, diamond-shaped panes, almost
covered with ivy, producing a green gloom, not without its solemnity, within. This ivy was
the home of an infinite number of little birds, which twittered and warbled, till it might
have been thought that they were emulous of the power of praise possessed by the human creatures
within, with such earnest, long-drawn strains did this crowd of winged songsters rejoice and
be glad in their beautiful gift of life. The interior of the building was plain and simple
as plain and simple could be. When it was fitted up, oak-timber was much cheaper than it is
now, so the wood-work was all of that description; but roughly hewed, for the early builders
had not much wealth to spare. The walls were whitewashed, and were recipients of the shadows
of the beauty without; on their "white plains" the tracery of the ivy might be seen, now still,
now stirred by the sudden flight of some little bird. The congregation consisted of here and
there a farmer with his labourers, who came down from the uplands beyond the town to worship
where their fathers worshipped, and who loved the place because they knew how much those fathers
had suffered for it, although they never troubled themselves with the reason why they left
the parish church; of a few shopkeepers, far more thoughtful and reasoning, who were Dissenters
from conviction, unmixed with old ancestral association; and of one or two families of still
higher worldly station. With many poor, who were drawn there by love for Mr Benson's character,
and by a feeling that the faith which made him what he was could not be far wrong, for the
base of the pyramid, and with Mr Bradshaw for its apex, the congregation stood complete.

This is an atom: 
The country people came in sleeking down their hair, and treading with earnest attempts at
noiseless lightness of step over the floor of the aisle; and by-and-by, when all were assembled,
Mr Benson followed, unmarshalled and unattended. When he had closed the pulpit-door, and knelt
in prayer for an instant or two, he gave out a psalm from the dear old Scottish paraphrase,
with its primitive inversion of the simple perfect Bible words; and a kind of precentor stood
up, and, having sounded the note on a pitch-pipe, sang a couple of lines by way of indicating
the tune; then all the congregation stood up, and sang aloud, Mr Bradshaw's great bass voice
being half a note in advance of the others, in accordance with his place of precedence as principal
member of the congregation. His powerful voice was like an organ very badly played, and very
much out of tune; but as he had no ear, and no diffidence, it pleased him very much to hear
the fine loud sound. He was a tall, large-boned, iron man; stern, powerful, and authoritative
in appearance; dressed in clothes of the finest broadcloth, and scrupulously ill-made, as if
to show that he was indifferent to all outward things. His wife was sweet and gentle-looking,
but as if she was thoroughly broken into submission.

This is an atom: 
Ruth did not see this, or hear aught but the words which were reverently--oh, how reverently!--spoken
by Mr Benson. He had had Ruth present in his thoughts all the time he had been preparing for
his Sunday duty; and he had tried carefully to eschew everything which she might feel as an
allusion to her own case. He remembered how the Good Shepherd, in Poussin's beautiful picture,
tenderly carried the lambs which had wearied themselves by going astray, and felt how like
tenderness was required towards poor Ruth. But where is the chapter which does not contain
something which a broken and contrite spirit may not apply to itself? And so it fell out that,
as he read, Ruth's heart was smitten, and she sank down, and down, till she was kneeling on
the floor of the pew, and speaking to God in the spirit, if not in the words, of the Prodigal
Son: "Father! I have sinned against Heaven and before Thee, and am no more worthy to be called
Thy child!" Miss Benson was thankful (although she loved Ruth the better for this self-abandonment)
that the minister's seat was far in the shade of the gallery. She tried to look most attentive
to her brother, in order that Mr Bradshaw might not suspect anything unusual, while she stealthily
took hold of Ruth's passive hand, as it lay helpless on the cushion, and pressed it softly
and tenderly. But Ruth sat on the ground, bowed down and crushed in her sorrow, till all was ended.

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson loitered in her seat, divided between the consciousness that she, as _locum tenens_
for the minister's wife, was expected to be at the door to receive the kind greetings of many
after her absence from home, and her unwillingness to disturb Ruth, who was evidently praying,
and, by her quiet breathing, receiving grave and solemn influences into her soul. At length
she rose up, calm and composed even to dignity. The chapel was still and empty; but Miss Benson
heard the buzz of voices in the chapel-yard without. They were probably those of people waiting
for her; and she summoned courage, and taking Ruth's arm in hers, and holding her hand affectionately,
they went out into the broad daylight. As they issued forth, Miss Benson heard Mr Bradshaw's
strong bass voice speaking to her brother, and winced, as she knew he would be wincing, under
the broad praise, which is impertinence, however little it may be intended or esteemed as such.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes!--my wife told me yesterday about her--her husband was a surgeon; my father was a
surgeon too, as I think you have heard. Very much to your credit, I must say, Mr Benson, with
your limited means, to burden yourself with a poor relation. Very creditable indeed."

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson glanced at Ruth; she either did not hear or did not understand, but passed on into
the awful sphere of Mr Bradshaw's observation unmoved. He was in a bland and condescending
humour of universal approval, and when he saw Ruth, he nodded his head in token of satisfaction.
That ordeal was over, Miss Benson thought, and in the thought rejoiced.

This is an atom: 
"After dinner, you must go and lie down, my dear," said she, untying Ruth's bonnet-strings,
and kissing her. "Sally goes to church again, but you won't mind staying alone in the house.
I am sorry we have so many people to dinner, but my brother will always have enough on Sundays
for any old or weak people, who may have come from a distance, to stay and dine with us; and
to-day they all seem to have come, because it is his first Sabbath at home."

This is an atom: 
In this way Ruth's first Sabbath passed over.

CHAPTER XV

This is an atom: 
Mother and Child

This is an atom: 
"Here is a parcel for you, Ruth!" said Miss Benson on the Tuesday morning.

This is an atom: 
"For me!" said Ruth, all sorts of rushing thoughts and hopes filling her mind, and turning
her dizzy with expectation. If it had been from "him," the new-born resolutions would have
had a hard struggle for existence.

This is an atom: 
"It is directed 'Mrs Denbigh,'" said Miss Benson, before giving it up. "It is in Mrs Bradshaw's
handwriting;" and, far more curious than Ruth, she awaited the untying of the close-knotted
string. When the paper was opened, it displayed a whole piece of delicate cambric-muslin; and
there was a short note from Mrs Bradshaw to Ruth, saying her husband had wished her to send
this muslin in aid of any preparations Mrs Denbigh might have to make. Ruth said nothing, but
coloured up, and sat down again to her employment.

This is an atom: 
"Very fine muslin indeed," said Miss Benson, feeling it, and holding it up against the light,
with the air of a connoisseur; yet all the time she was glancing at Ruth's grave face. The
latter kept silence, and showed no wish to inspect her present further. At last she said, in
a low voice,

This is an atom: 
"I suppose I may send it back again?"

This is an atom: 
"My dear child! send it back to Mr Bradshaw! You'd offend him for life. You may depend upon
it, he means it as a mark of high favour!"

This is an atom: 
"What right had he to send it me?" asked Ruth, still in her quiet voice.

This is an atom: 
"What right? Mr Bradshaw thinks-- I don't know exactly what you mean by 'right.'"

This is an atom: 
Ruth was silent for a moment, and then said:

This is an atom: 
"There are people to whom I love to feel that I owe gratitude--gratitude which I cannot express,
and had better not talk about--but I cannot see why a person whom I do not know should lay
me under an obligation. Oh! don't say I must take this muslin, please, Miss Benson!"

This is an atom: 
What Miss Benson might have said if her brother had not just then entered the room, neither
he nor any other person could tell; but she felt his presence was most opportune, and called
him in as umpire. He had come hastily, for he had much to do; but he no sooner heard the case
than he sat down, and tried to draw some more explicit declaration of her feeling from Ruth,
who had remained silent during Miss Benson's explanation.

This is an atom: 
"You would rather send this present back?" said he.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," she answered, softly. "Is it wrong?"

This is an atom: 
"Why do you want to return it?"

This is an atom: 
"Because I feel as if Mr Bradshaw had no right to offer it me."

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson was silent.

This is an atom: 
"It's beautifully fine," said Miss Benson, still examining the piece.

This is an atom: 
"You think that it is a right which must be earned?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said she, after a minute's pause. "Don't you?"

This is an atom: 
"I understand what you mean. It is a delight to have gifts made to you by those whom you esteem
and love, because then such gifts are merely to be considered as fringes to the garment--as
inconsiderable additions to the mighty treasure of their affection, adding a grace, but no
additional value, to what before was precious, and proceeding as naturally out of that as leaves
burgeon out upon the trees; but you feel it to be different when there is no regard for the
giver to idealise the gift--when it simply takes its stand among your property as so much money's
value. Is this it, Ruth?"

This is an atom: 
"I think it is. I never reasoned why I felt as I did; I only knew that Mr Bradshaw's giving
me a present hurt me, instead of making me glad."

This is an atom: 
"Well, but there is another side of the case we have not looked at yet--we must think of that,
too. You know who said, 'Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you'? Mr Bradshaw
may not have had that in his mind when he desired his wife to send you this; he may have been
self-seeking, and only anxious to gratify his love of patronising--that is the worst motive
we can give him; and that would be no excuse for your thinking only of yourself, and returning
his present."

This is an atom: 
"But you would not have me pretend to be obliged?" asked Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"No, I would not. I have often been similarly situated to you, Ruth; Mr Bradshaw has frequently
opposed me on the points on which I feel the warmest--am the most earnestly convinced. He,
no doubt, thinks me Quixotic, and often speaks of me, and to me, with great contempt when he
is angry. I suppose he has a little fit of penitence afterwards, or perhaps he thinks he can
pay for ungracious speeches by a present; so, formerly, he invariably sent me something after
these occasions. It was a time, of all others, to feel as you are doing now; but I became convinced
it would be right to accept them, giving only the very cool thanks which I felt. This omission
of all show of much gratitude had the best effect--the presents have much diminished; but if
the gifts have lessened, the unjustifiable speeches have decreased in still greater proportion,
and I am sure we respect each other more. Take this muslin, Ruth, for the reason I named; and
thank him as your feelings prompt you. Overstrained expressions of gratitude always seem like
an endeavour to place the receiver of these expressions in the position of debtor for future
favours. But you won't fall into this error."

This is an atom: 
Ruth listened to Mr Benson; but she had not yet fallen sufficiently into the tone of his mind
to understand him fully. She only felt that he comprehended her better than Miss Benson, who
once more tried to reconcile her to her present, by calling her attention to the length and
breadth thereof.

This is an atom: 
"I will do what you wish me," she said, after a little pause of thoughtfulness. "May we talk
of something else?"

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson saw that his sister's frame of mind was not particularly congenial with Ruth's, any
more than Ruth's was with Miss Benson's; and, putting aside all thought of returning to the
business which had appeared to him so important when he came into the room (but which principally
related to himself), he remained above an hour in the parlour, interesting them on subjects
far removed from the present, and left them at the end of that time soothed and calm.

This is an atom: 
But the present gave a new current to Ruth's ideas. Her heart was as yet too sore to speak,
but her mind was crowded with plans. She asked Sally to buy her (with the money produced by
the sale of a ring or two) the coarsest linen, the homeliest dark blue print, and similar materials;
on which she set busily to work to make clothes for herself; and as they were made, she put
them on; and as she put them on, she gave a grace to each, which such homely material and simple
shaping had never had before. Then the fine linen and delicate soft white muslin, which she
had chosen in preference to more expensive articles of dress when Mr Bellingham had given her
_carte blanche_ in London, were cut into small garments, most daintily stitched and made ready
for the little creature, for whom in its white purity of soul nothing could be too precious.

This is an atom: 
The love which dictated this extreme simplicity and coarseness of attire, was taken for stiff,
hard economy by Mr Bradshaw, when he deigned to observe it. And economy by itself, without
any soul or spirit in it to make it living and holy, was a great merit in his eyes. Indeed,
Ruth altogether found favour with him. Her quiet manner, subdued by an internal consciousness
of a deeper cause for sorrow than he was aware of, he interpreted into a very proper and becoming
awe of him. He looked off from his own prayers to observe how well she attended to hers at
chapel; when he came to any verse in the hymn relating to immortality or a future life, he
sang it unusually loud, thinking he should thus comfort her in her sorrow for her deceased
husband. He desired Mrs Bradshaw to pay her every attention she could; and even once remarked,
that he thought her so respectable a young person that he should not object to her being asked
to tea the next time Mr and Miss Benson came. When this curious courtship ends, by terms being
agreed upon, the destined bridegroom pays down a sum of money to the bride, a license is taken
out from the Cadi, and the parties are married. I send you a description of a marriage-ceremony,
at which I was present the other day.

This is an atom: 
The bridegroom (who is one of the officers of the household) came out of his house, attended by
a vast number of his friends, and mounted one of the best horses belonging to the Emperor, most
curiously and richly caparisoned.

This is an atom: 
He carried his sword unsheathed, and was preceded by a splendid standard, and a band of music;
he was followed by a kind of palanquin, supported on the shoulders of four stout black slaves,
a detachment of cavalry firing off their pieces every minute, and a procession of relatives
and friends, the whole moving with great mirth and jollity,
Before they reached the house of the bride, the cavalcade halted, and the bridegroom dismounted,
assisted by his negro slaves, and knocked loudly at the door three times. The lady was brought
out in a covered chair, attended by four women, completely muffled up. The whole party of the
bridegroom turned their backs, and she was smuggled into the palanquin: they then returned
in the same style to the house of her lord, where, before she was allowed to enter, he placed
himself at the entrance, and extending his right arm across the door-way, she passed under,
as an indication of her voluntary and unconditional submission to his will and pleasure.

This is an atom: 
After this ceremony, the bridegroom was obliged to retire to the house of his nearest relation,
where he continued three days and nights, feasting, and receiving presents from all his male
friends, while the bride was paid the same compliments by her female acquaintance. At the
expiration of the appointed time, the gentleman returned to his own house.

This is an atom: 
The Moors are not allowed by their law more than four wives, but they may have as many concubines
as they can maintain; accordingly, the wealthy Moors, besides their
wives, keep a kind of seraglio of women of all colours.

This is an atom: 
From their marriages, I am insensibly led to the subject of the burial of their dead. Not that
any idea strikes me of an analogy between the situations of a married person, and one consigned
to the "_narrow house_," as Ossian poetically styles the grave; but from a certain succession
of thought, for which one is at a loss to account. In the burial of their dead, they are
decent and pious, without pomp or show. The corpse is attended by the relations and friends,
chanting passages from the Koran, to the mosque, where it is washed, and it is afterwards
interred in a place at some distance from the town, the Iman, or priest, pronouncing an oration,
containing the eulogy of the deceased. The male relations express their regard by alms and
prayers, the women by ornamenting the tomb with flowers and green leaves. Their term of mourning
is the same as ours, twelve months, during which period the widows divest themselves of
every ornament, and appear habited in the coarsest attire. Their burial-grounds are inclosed
by cypress and other dark lofty trees, the lower parts of which are interwoven with odoriferous
shrubs and creeping plants, forming an almost impenetrable hedge.

This is an atom: 
Some of their tombs are very curious, though they exhibit specimens of the rudest architecture.
There are also several saints' houses in their burying-places,
which render them doubly sacred; and no Christian or Jew is suffered
to enter, on pain of death.

This is an atom: 
Friday being their Sabbath, the day is kept perfectly holy; all the Moors are employed in
prayer, reading the Koran, or visiting the tombs of their departed friends.

This is an atom: 
Curiosity prompted me to go and see an assemblage of fanatics, at a celebrated saint's house,
in the neighbourhood of this town. They were to perform many wonderful things, such as
tearing a live sheep in pieces, and devouring the flesh, fighting with wild beasts, and several
other barbarous exhibitions. These people, called in Barbary _Free Masons_, are nothing more
than a set of canting, roaring companions, surcharged with wine
and other liquors, and assembled in this holy place, for the sole
purpose of giving free vent to their brutal passions.

This is an atom: 
This society is peculiar to itself, having no connexion with our ancient or modern Free Masons.

This is an atom: 
I have however obtained a free access to their saints' houses and secret meetings, with
permission to go any where unmolested; but I always take the precaution to go well armed, and
escorted by the Emperor's guards, as nothing can exceed the barbarous
acts of this fanatic set of people.

This is an atom: 
I am extremely happy to say, that my most sanguine expectations with regard to the poor man,
whose accident I mentioned in my last, are realized; every unfavourable symptom has vanished,
and I can safely rely on his perfect recovery.

This is an atom: 
The complaint of my female patient has also given way to a proper course of medicine, and the
Governor is one of the happiest of men.

This is an atom: 
When I announced the pleasing intelligence of her disease being removed, he embraced me with
such ecstacy that I almost dreaded suffocation; in short, he has spared nothing that can
evince his gratitude and satisfaction, for what he terms the inestimable benefit I have
conferred upon him.

This is an atom: 
The country round this city is inexpressibly rich and beautiful, being laid put for several miles
in gardens, abounding in flowers and fruit-trees; among the latter the vine sands pre-eminent,
yielding most delicious grapes. The air here, as in the other parts of Barbary, is very pure
and salubrious.

Mequinez
Since I wrote last, I have taken a trip to Morocco and back again. As I had a great deal of
leisure time, and every thing here having lost the attraction of novelty, I determined to go
further up the interior of the country; and accordingly applied to the Emperor for permission
to visit Morocco, which he granted, but with the injunction that I should return as quickly as
possible.

This is an atom: 
I set off, accompanied by my usual guard, which I assure you I never found so necessary as
on this journey; for the rapacious spirit of the peasantry exposed us continually to the
danger of being plundered, we were therefore obliged to keep watch alternately, to prevent
our property, perhaps our lives, becoming a prey to these wretches. The neighbourhood of
Morocco is dreadfully infested by robbers and assassins.

This is an atom: 
The inhabitants of the empire of Morocco, that are not in a military capacity, or otherwise
immediately in the service of the Emperor, are miserably poor; and the natural indolence of
their disposition preventing them from making any laudable exertions towards gaining a livelihood,
they have recourse to every means of fraud and violence. It is astonishing how frequently
assassinations and robberies are committed in this empire, notwithstanding the ruffians,
when detected, are punished in the most exemplary manner, by the right hand and left foot being
cut off, and the head afterwards being severed from the body. The relations of the murderer
are all fined very heavily, and the judgment often extends to the whole village, near which
the crime had been perpetrated; yet seldom a day passes but some daring robbery is committed,
accompanied by the most wanton and savage cruelty; the unhappy victim of the plunderer being
frequently left in the public roads in a most shocking state of mutilation.

This is an atom: 
Another ostensible cause of the dereliction of the peasantry from
the laws of humanity, may be the extreme oppression under which
they groan; as, on account of their former propensity to rebellion,
they are now ruled with a rod of iron, which in all probability has
rendered them callous, and deaf to the voice of nature.

This is an atom: 
But, independently of these occasional depredations, there is a
band of vagrants, who are actuated by no other motives, than what
their own black hearts suggest.

This is an atom: 
They inhabit caves in the sides of enormous rocky precipices, and
go entirely naked: their principal food is the flesh of wild beasts.

This is an atom: 
This tribe of freebooters appears to be quite a distinct set of people; they seem to have an
invincible aversion to the Mahometan religion, and worship the _sun_ and _fire_; they speak a
different language from the rest of the inhabitants, a mixture of African and the _old_ Arabic;
all which circumstances favour their own report of themselves, which is, that they are the
genuine descendants of the original inhabitants. They look down upon the more civilized Moors
with contempt, and consider them as the real usurpers of their country, and the plunderers of
their property.

This is an atom: 
They subsist chiefly by rapine, and frequently throw a whole village
into consternation by their nocturnal visits; yet their cunning and
dexterity are so great, that they almost constantly elude the
vigilance of justice: indeed, they are never forced from their
places of retreat (which are inaccessible to all but themselves),
but when taken, it is either in the act of robbing, or when they
venture to the markets or fairs; and then the capture is not effected
without a strong body of the military.

This is an atom: 
I was much disappointed on my arrival at Morocco with the appearance of the place; for, instead
of finding it, as I expected, superior to Fez and Mequinez, I found it a large ruinous town,
almost without inhabitants. It contains, indeed, a great many mosques, caravanseras, public
baths, marketplaces or squares, and palaces of the Xeriffes, but all in almost deplorable
state of ruin. Not many years since, this city was the Imperial residence, and contained six
hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants; but the late civil wars, and the plague, which raged
with such violence, in the beginning of the present Emperor's
reign, nearly depopulated it.

This is an atom: 
In consequence of the latter melancholy event, the court was removed
to Fez and Mequinez.

This is an atom: 
To this account we may place the present desolate appearance of Morocco. The Imperial palace is,
however, kept in repair, as the Emperor goes to Morocco annually to spend the fast-days, which
are during the months of October and November; scarcely one fourth of the other palaces and
houses are inhabited; but though this city now exhibits evident symptoms of rapid decay, we
may still form a just idea of its former grandeur and magnificence.

This is an atom: 
The plain of Morocco is bounded by that long ridge of mountains called _Atlas_, which screen the
town from the scorching heat of the easterly winds, while the snow, with which their summits
are covered, renders the climate more temperate than in other parts of Barbary. Notwithstanding
the salubrity of the climate of Morocco, a residence there is
rendered miserable, by the multitudes of scorpions, serpents, gnats,
and bugs, which infest the town and its neighbourhood.

This is an atom: 
His Imperial Majesty holds a court of justice here, previous to the commencement of the holidays,
and also issues orders for a general ablution by men, women, and
children, of every class:
this, no doubt, is very necessary, as the common people seldom
change their linen, and the greater part of them are covered with
vermin.

This is an atom: 
During the fast they dare not touch any food while the sun is up, and when at night they are
allowed to break their fast, they absolutely make perfect beasts of themselves. Smoking, or
chewing tobacco, and taking snuff, are strictly prohibited, by an edict from the Emperor:
the vender is punished with the bastinado, and a confiscation of all his goods and cattle,
and the buyer with six years imprisonment.

This is an atom: 
Owing to the intense heat of the weather lately, there is a great scarcity of water: so that
we were obliged to carry it up in bags made of goat-skin, to supply us on the road; and coming
back we took the same precaution.

This is an atom: 
When at Morocco, I was extremely anxious to visit _Mogedor_, a sea-port town, and the island
of _Erythia_, now also called Mogedor, which island contains a castle of considerable strength,
defended by a strong garrison, stationed there chiefly, as I have been told, to protect the
gold-mines in the neighbourhood; but the distance was very great, and my time so limited, that I could
not spare a fortnight, which it would at least have required to get there and back again.
I have been returned here two days, and, as I observed before, not so much gratified as I
expected.

This is an atom: 
As I passed one of the courts of the palace yesterday, a fellow was receiving punishment for
a robbery. The right hand and foot were severed at the articulation, by a single blow of a
large axe; the stumps were immediately immersed in a vessel of boiling pitch; and in this miserable
condition he was turned about his business. I once attended a man who had suffered these
amputations; he soon recovered, and, to my great surprise, instead of sorrowing for his loss,
he skipped about as nimbly as possible, and afterwards enlisted in the police. After the fellow
was turned away yesterday, a peasant, who had walked nearly two hundred miles, presented
himself before the Emperor, to complain of the Governor of his province, for not having done him
justice in assisting him to recover a debt of about six shillings. The Emperor listened to
his grievance, issued an order to enforce the payment of the debt, and gave the poor man a
sum of money to enable him to return home.

_Moorish Character--Form of Devotion--Meals--Revenue--Poll-tax on the Jews--Royal
Carriages--Ostrich-riding--Public Schools--Watch-dogs._
Mequinez.

This is an atom: 
The established religion of the Moors is Mahometan. Formerly, as well as at present, women were
considered by the Moors as the mere objects of sensuality, and only esteemed while in full
bloom. At the age of thirty, or at most forty, they were looked upon as an inferior order
of beings, and doomed to the most abject and insupportable slavery: indeed, the latter circumstance
still exists, though considerably mitigated. No wonder then that the doctrine of Mahomet
should be cordially embraced by a people with whose inclinations it so exactly coincided.
But that part only was adopted, which indulged them in the gratification of their wishes;
that which imposed restraint was renounced, or only nominally acceded to. And fortunate it
certainly is for the security of the neighbouring countries that they did so; as, when
formerly they were inured from infancy to all the hardships of a warlike life, and possessed
much skill in war, they were undoubtedly very formidable; but since their conversion to
Mahometanism, they have gradually become inactive, and their natural passion for war and
conquest has changed to absolute effeminacy. The illiterate system of the Moors has also
completely shut the door against the arts and sciences, and all knowledge of the value of a
free and secure commerce. Yet, notwithstanding this people are no longer either in appearance
or reality those fierce barbarians they once were, nor can their actions in point of valour
bear any comparison with those of their ancestors, like them they retain a most inveterate
antipathy to all Christians; and a propensity towards cruelty, revenge, rapine, and murder,
still continues to form one of the most prominent features of their character. However, under
the comparatively mild government of the present Emperor, their behaviour towards Christians
has visibly undergone a favourable change, which would almost persuade some to indulge a
hope of the entire annihilation of their aversion; but I am sorry to add, that I am not so
sanguine, as from accurate observation I have been led to conclude, that nothing but an
immense length of time can overcome their habitual prejudices and constitutional inclinations.

This is an atom: 
The male inhabitants of these states are obliged to attend their places of public worship four
times in the course of twenty-four hours. The first prayer begins about half an hour before
sun-rising, and is so regulated that they may, just as the sun rises, finish eight adorations.

This is an atom: 
They pray again at noon, at sun-set, and at midnight: they are very fervent in their devotions,
and always turn their faces towards the east: they fast three times in a year; the first
time thirty days, the next nine, and the last seven: during these fasts they abstain from beans,
garlic, and some other pulse and vegetables. They call the Almighty, _God of Gods_, and
_Lord of Lords_; and they all believe that the souls of wicked men will be punished till a
certain period, when they will be received to mercy.

This is an atom: 
In the morning, after prayer, they drink strong tea, which they prefer to coffee. At eleven
o'clock they, go to dinner, which consists of fruits, sweetmeats, and their favourite
_cous-ca-sou_, piled up in a large wooden bowl. Their chief meal is after their return from
evening prayer.
They eat cakes made of fine wheaten flour; and as they consider it a crime to cut bread or
meat of any kind after it is dressed, these cakes are made so thin that they may be easily
broken with the hands; and their meat, which is generally mutton or fowls, is so prepared
that they can without difficulty separate it from the bones with their fingers. They sit
cross-legged upon cushions, and devour their food very greedily and without the least ceremony.
Although sobriety is strictly enjoined by the Mahometan law, yet the Moorish inhabitants of
the principal towns in Barbary make free with most excellent wines and spirits of their own
manufacture.

This is an atom: 
The revenues of the Emperor have of late augmented prodigiously. He receives a tenth part of all
the property of his Mahometan subjects; and he compels every Jew residing in his dominions to
pay a poll-tax of six crowns annually. The number of Israelites subject to the Emperor of
Morocco exceeds one hundred thousand. They are strictly guarded, and cruelly oppressed, and
are not permitted to quit the states without a special leave from the Emperor, to obtain which
they are obliged to pay down a large sum of money.

This is an atom: 
The authority of the Emperor is unlimited, as is that of his Governors, who possess a power of
life and death. No rank nor condition of Moors is exempt from taxation, excepting the immediate
princes of the blood, and the _Xeriffes_, which are the only degrees of nobility the Moors
have. The Xeriffes are the descendants of their monarchs, and their titles are hereditary:
but the title of _Sheik_ is temporary; so that the respect paid to the Sheiks on account of
their high situations expires with them.

This is an atom: 
Coaches, carriages, and palanquins are used only by the Emperor. I have seen some, both here and
at Fez, which are really elegant; they are for the use of his ladies when they go to spend
the day in any of the Imperial gardens. The Emperor has several very handsome chariots, in
one of which he usually rides, drawn by six mules. The Moors ride on horseback, attended by a
number of slaves or soldiers, according to their rank and wealth.

This is an atom: 
The princes of the blood and Xeriffes are not allowed to interfere in any political or public
business, and are never consulted in state affairs. They are generally provided for, with sinecure
places to support their rank, but many of these are too small to enable them to do so. The
several Governors of provinces have each a large tract of land; and the tax collected from the
venders and buyers in the weekly markets in their districts is also appropriated by them to
defray the charges of their retinue and troops. From the vast crown lands in this country,
the Emperor obtains sufficient for the expenses of the court,
household, and great officers of state; from which circumstance,
and what I have before said of his revenues, it is evident that his
coffers must be most abundantly supplied, and his annual saving in
ordinary cases very great. A detachment of troops from each province
is sent every three months to collect the tributes, which are levied
with the most unrelenting rigour. There are some vestiges of the
Caliphate government still remaining; for in places where no military
officer resides, the Mufti, or high-priest, is the fountain of all
justice; he collects the tributes, and under him the Cadis or civil
officers act in the same manner as our justices of the peace.
The general language of the country is Arabic; but in the inland
countries, in the provinces of Suz, Tafilet, and Gessula, the ancient
African language is still spoken. Those remote districts are now
under the sovereignty of the Emperor of Morocco; but I am told they
contain nothing particularly curious, except an immense number of
pelicans and ostriches, the latter so strong as to be able to carry
a man upon their backs. I one day saw a Moor riding in a court here
upon one, which he had got from those parts, and tamed for. show.
The Moors write in the manner of the Hebrew language, from right
to left; they are wonderfully expeditious in it, and their seals
are very neat. Public schools have lately been established in all
the towns and villages of these states; but, as the children are
taught by their priests, a set of superstitious and fanatic people,
no great benefit, to change or improve their manners, can accrue
from such an institution.
I believe, in a former letter I told you that the peasantry reside
in tents; I have however observed a few huts built of clay, but
very few. In the centre of both the huts and tents, there is a hole
dug in the ground, where they make a fire, with an outlet in the
roof to vent the smoke. They generally burn wood, or a species of
charcoal, in the preparation of which they contrive to deprive it
of the baneful effects usually experienced from the use of it in
England.Sally waited for some exclamation at the conclusion of her tale; but receiving none, she stepped
softly to the bedside, and there lay Ruth, peaceful as death, with her baby on her breast.

This is an atom: 
"I thought I'd lost some of my gifts if I could not talk a body to sleep," said Sally, in a
satisfied and self-complacent tone.

This is an atom: 
Youth is strong and powerful, and makes a hard battle against sorrow. So Ruth strove and strengthened,
and her baby flourished accordingly; and before the little celandines were out on the hedge-banks,
or the white violets had sent forth their fragrance from the border under the south wall of
Miss Benson's small garden, Ruth was able to carry her baby into that sheltered place on sunny
days.

This is an atom: 
She often wished to thank Mr Benson and his sister, but she did not know how to tell the deep
gratitude she felt, and therefore she was silent. But they understood her silence well. One
day, as she watched her sleeping child, she spoke to Miss Benson, with whom she happened to
be alone.

This is an atom: 
"Do you know of any cottage where the people are clean, and where they would not mind taking
me in?" asked she.

This is an atom: 
"Taking you in! What do you mean?" said Miss Benson, dropping her knitting, in order to observe
Ruth more closely.

This is an atom: 
"I mean," said Ruth, "where I might lodge with my baby--any very poor place would do, only
it must be clean, or he might be ill."

This is an atom: 
"And what in the world do you want to go and lodge in a cottage for?" said Miss Benson, indignantly.

This is an atom: 
Ruth did not lift up her eyes, but she spoke with a firmness which showed that she had considered
the subject.

This is an atom: 
"I think I could make dresses. I know I did not learn as much as I might, but perhaps I might
do for servants, and people who are not particular."

This is an atom: 
"Servants are as particular as any one," said Miss Benson, glad to lay hold of the first objection
that she could.

This is an atom: 
"Well! somebody who would be patient with me," said Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"Nobody is patient over an ill-fitting gown," put in Miss Benson. "There's the stuff spoilt,
and what not!"

This is an atom: 
"Perhaps I could find plain work to do," said Ruth, very meekly. "That I can do very well;
mamma taught me, and I liked to learn from her. If you would be so good, Miss Benson, you might
tell people I could do plain work very neatly, and punctually, and cheaply."

This is an atom: 
"You'd get sixpence a day, perhaps," said Miss Benson, "and who would take care of baby, I
should like to know? Prettily he'd be neglected, would not he? Why, he'd have the croup and
the typhus fever in no time, and be burnt to ashes after."

This is an atom: 
"I have thought of all. Look how he sleeps! Hush, darling;" for just at this point he began
to cry, and to show his determination to be awake, as if in contradiction to his mother's words.
Ruth took him up, and carried him about the room while she went on speaking.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, just now I know he will not sleep; but very often he will, and in the night he always does."

This is an atom: 
"And so you'd work in the night and kill yourself, and leave your poor baby an orphan. Ruth!
I'm ashamed of you. Now, brother" (Mr Benson had just come in), "is not this too bad of Ruth;
here she is planning to go away and leave us, just as we--as I, at least, have grown so fond
of baby, and he's beginning to know me."

This is an atom: 
"Where were you thinking of going to, Ruth?" interrupted Mr Benson, with mild surprise.

This is an atom: 
"Anywhere to be near you and Miss Benson; in any poor cottage where I might lodge very cheaply,
and earn my livelihood by taking in plain sewing, and perhaps a little dressmaking; and where
I could come and see you and dear Miss Benson sometimes and bring baby."

This is an atom: 
"If he was not dead before then of some fever, or burn, or scald, poor neglected child; or
you had not worked yourself to death with never sleeping," said Miss Benson.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson thought a minute or two, and then he spoke to Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"Whatever you may do when this little fellow is a year old, and able to dispense with some
of a mother's care, let me beg you, Ruth, as a favour to me--as a still greater favour to my
sister, is it not, Faith?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes; you may put it so if you like."

This is an atom: 
"To stay with us," continued he, "till then. When baby is twelve months old, we'll talk about
it again, and very likely before then some opening may be shown us. Never fear leading an idle
life, Ruth. We'll treat you as a daughter, and set you all the household tasks; and it is not
for your sake that we ask you to stay, but for this little dumb helpless child's; and it is
not for our sake that you must stay, but for his."

This is an atom: 
Ruth was sobbing.

This is an atom: 
"I do not deserve your kindness," said she, in a broken voice; "I do not deserve it."

This is an atom: 
Her tears fell fast and soft like summer rain, but no further word was spoken. Mr Benson quietly
passed on to make the inquiry for which he had entered the room.

This is an atom: 
But when there was nothing to decide upon, and no necessity for entering upon any new course
of action, Ruth's mind relaxed from its strung-up state. She fell into trains of reverie, and
mournful regretful recollections which rendered her languid and tearful. This was noticed both
by Miss Benson and Sally, and as each had keen sympathies, and felt depressed when they saw
any one near them depressed, and as each, without much reasoning on the cause or reason for
such depression, felt irritated at the uncomfortable state into which they themselves were
thrown, they both resolved to speak to Ruth on the next fitting occasion.

This is an atom: 
Accordingly, one afternoon--the morning of that day had been spent by Ruth in housework, for
she had insisted on Mr Benson's words, and had taken Miss Benson's share of the more active
and fatiguing household duties, but she went through them heavily, and as if her heart was
far away--in the afternoon when she was nursing her child, Sally, on coming into the back parlour,
found her there alone, and easily detected the fact that she had been crying.

This is an atom: 
"Where's Miss Benson?" said Sally, gruffly.

This is an atom: 
"Gone out with Mr Benson," answered Ruth, with an absent sadness in her voice and manner. Her
tears, scarce checked while she spoke, began to fall afresh; and as Sally stood and gazed she
saw the babe look back in his mother's face, and his little lip begin to quiver, and his open
blue eye to grow over-clouded, as with some mysterious sympathy with the sorrowful face bent
over him. Sally took him briskly from his mother's arms; Ruth looked up in grave surprise,
for in truth she had forgotten Sally's presence, and the suddenness of the motion startled her.

This is an atom: 
"My bonny boy! are they letting the salt tears drop on thy sweet face before thou'rt weaned!
Little somebody knows how to be a mother--I could make a better myself. 'Dance, thumbkin, dance--dance,
ye merry men every one.' Aye, that's it! smile, my pretty. Any one but a child like thee,"
continued she, turning to Ruth, "would have known better than to bring ill-luck on thy babby
by letting tears fall on its face before it was weaned. But thou'rt not fit to have a babby,
and so I've said many a time. I've a great mind to buy thee a doll, and take thy babby mysel'."

This is an atom: 
Sally did not look at Ruth, for she was too much engaged in amusing the baby with the tassel
of the string to the window-blind, or else she would have seen the dignity which the mother's
soul put into Ruth at that moment. Sally was quelled into silence by the gentle composure,
the self-command over her passionate sorrow, which gave to Ruth an unconscious grandeur of
demeanour as she came up to the old servant.

This is an atom: 
"Give him back to me, please. I did not know it brought ill-luck, or if my heart broke I would
not have let a tear drop on his face--I never will again. Thank you, Sally," as the servant
relinquished him to her who came in the name of a mother. Sally watched Ruth's grave, sweet
smile, as she followed up Sally's play with the tassel, and imitated, with all the docility
inspired by love, every movement and sound which had amused her babe.

This is an atom: 
"Thou'lt be a mother, after all," said Sally, with a kind of admiration of the control which
Ruth was exercising over herself. "But why talk of thy heart breaking? I don't question thee
about what's past and gone; but now thou'rt wanting for nothing, nor thy child either; the
time to come is the Lord's, and in His hands; and yet thou goest about a-sighing and a-moaning
in a way that I can't stand or thole."

This is an atom: 
"What do I do wrong?" said Ruth; "I try to do all I can."

This is an atom: 
"Yes, in a way," said Sally, puzzled to know how to describe her meaning. "Thou dost it--but
there's a right and a wrong way of setting about everything--and to my thinking, the right
way is to take a thing up heartily, if it is only making a bed. Why! dear ah me, making a bed
may be done after a Christian fashion, I take it, or else what's to come of such as me in heaven,
who've had little enough time on earth for clapping ourselves down on our knees for set prayers?
When I was a girl, and wretched enough about Master Thurstan, and the crook on his back which
came of the fall I gave him, I took to praying and sighing, and giving up the world; and I
thought it were wicked to care for the flesh, so I made heavy puddings, and was careless about
dinner and the rooms, and thought I was doing my duty, though I did call myself a miserable
sinner. But one night, the old missus (Master Thurstan's mother) came in, and sat down by me,
as I was a-scolding myself, without thinking of what I was saying; and, says she, 'Sally! what
are you blaming yourself about, and groaning over? We hear you in the parlour every night,
and it makes my heart ache.' 'Oh, ma'am,' says I, 'I'm a miserable sinner, and I'm travailing
in the new birth.' 'Was that the reason,' says she, 'why the pudding was so heavy to-day?'
'Oh, ma'am, ma'am,' said I, 'if you would not think of the things of the flesh, but trouble
yourself about your immortal soul.' And I sat a-shaking my head to think about her soul. 'But,'
says she, in her sweet-dropping voice, 'I do try to think of my soul every hour of the day,
if by that you mean trying to do the will of God, but we'll talk now about the pudding; Master
Thurstan could not eat it, and I know you'll be sorry for that.' Well! I was sorry, but I didn't
choose to say so, as she seemed to expect me; so says I, 'It's a pity to see children brought
up to care for things of the flesh;' and then I could have bitten my tongue out, for the missus
looked so grave, and I thought of my darling little lad pining for want of his food. At last,
says she, 'Sally, do you think God has put us into the world just to be selfish, and do nothing
but see after our own souls? or to help one another with heart and hand, as Christ did to all
who wanted help?' I was silent, for, you see, she puzzled me. So she went on, 'What is that
beautiful answer in your Church catechism, Sally?' I were pleased to hear a Dissenter, as I
did not think would have done it, speak so knowledgeably about the catechism, and she went
on: '"to do my duty in that station of life unto which it shall please God to call me;" well,
your station is a servant, and it is as honourable as a king's, if you look at it right; you
are to help and serve others in one way, just as a king is to help others in another. Now what
way are you to help and serve, or to do your duty, in that station of life unto which it has
pleased God to call you? Did it answer God's purpose, and serve Him, when the food was unfit
for a child to eat, and unwholesome for any one?' Well! I would not give it up, I was so pig-headed
about my soul; so says I, 'I wish folks would be content with locusts and wild honey, and leave
other folks in peace to work out their salvation;' and I groaned out pretty loud to think of
missus's soul. I often think since she smiled a bit at me; but she said, 'Well, Sally, to-morrow,
you shall have time to work out your salvation; but as we have no locusts in England, and I
don't think they'd agree with Master Thurstan if we had, I will come and make the pudding;
but I shall try and do it well, not only for him to like it, but because everything may be
done in a right way or a wrong; the right way is to do it as well as we can, as in God's sight;
the wrong is to do it in a self-seeking spirit, which either leads us to neglect it to follow
out some device of our own for our own ends, or to give up too much time and thought to it
both before and after the doing.' Well! I thought of all old missus's words this morning, when
I saw you making the beds. You sighed so, you could not half shake the pillows; your heart
was not in your work; and yet it was the duty God had set you, I reckon; I know it's not the
work parsons preach about; though I don't think they go so far off the mark when they read,
'whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, that do with all thy might.' Just try for a day to think
of all the odd jobs as has to be done well and truly as in God's sight, not just slurred over
anyhow, and you'll go through them twice as cheerfully, and have no thought to spare for sighing
or crying."

This is an atom: 
Sally bustled off to set on the kettle for tea, and felt half ashamed, in the quiet of the
kitchen, to think of the oration she had made in the parlour. But she saw with much satisfaction,
that henceforward Ruth nursed her boy with a vigour and cheerfulness that were reflected back
from him; and the household work was no longer performed with a languid indifference, as if
life and duty were distasteful. Miss Benson had her share in this improvement, though Sally
placidly took all the credit to herself. One day as she and Ruth sat together, Miss Benson
spoke of the child, and thence went on to talk about her own childhood. By degrees they spoke
of education, and the book-learning that forms one part of it; and the result was that Ruth
determined to get up early all through the bright summer mornings, to acquire the knowledge
hereafter to be given to her child. Her mind was uncultivated, her reading scant; beyond the
mere mechanical arts of education she knew nothing; but she had a refined taste, and excellent
sense and judgment to separate the true from the false. With these qualities, she set to work
under Mr Benson's directions. She read in the early morning the books that he marked out; she
trained herself with strict perseverance to do all thoroughly; she did not attempt to acquire
any foreign language, although her ambition was to learn Latin, in order to teach it to her
boy. Those summer mornings were happy, for she was learning neither to look backwards nor forwards,
but to live faithfully and earnestly in the present. She rose while the hedge-sparrow was yet
singing his _rÃ©veillÃ©_ to his mate; she dressed and opened her window, shading the soft-blowing
air and the sunny eastern light from her baby. If she grew tired, she went and looked at him,
and all her thoughts were holy prayers for him. Then she would gaze awhile out of the high
upper window on to the moorlands, that swelled in waves one behind the other, in the grey,
cool morning light. These were her occasional relaxations, and after them she returned with
strength to her work.

CHAPTER XVII

This is an atom: 
Leonard's Christening

This is an atom: 
In that body of Dissenters to which Mr Benson belonged, it is not considered necessary to baptize
infants as early as the ceremony can be performed; and many circumstances concurred to cause
the solemn thanksgiving and dedication of the child (for so these Dissenters look upon christenings)
to be deferred until it was probably somewhere about six months old. There had been many conversations
in the little sitting-room between the brother and sister and their _protegÃ©e_, which had consisted
more of questions betraying a thoughtful wondering kind of ignorance on the part of Ruth, and
answers more suggestive than explanatory from Mr Benson; while Miss Benson kept up a kind of
running commentary, always simple and often quaint, but with that intuition into the very heart
of all things truly religious which is often the gift of those who seem, at first sight, to
be only affectionate and sensible. When Mr Benson had explained his own views of what a christening
ought to be considered, and, by calling out Ruth's latent feelings into pious earnestness,
brought her into a right frame of mind, he felt that he had done what he could to make the
ceremony more than a mere form, and to invest it, quiet, humble, and obscure as it must necessarily
be in outward shape--mournful and anxious as much of its antecedents had rendered it--with
the severe grandeur of an act done in faith and truth.

This is an atom: 
It was not far to carry the little one, for, as I said, the chapel almost adjoined the minister's
house. The whole procession was to have consisted of Mr and Miss Benson, Ruth carrying her
baby, and Sally, who felt herself, as a Church-of-England woman, to be condescending and kind
in requesting leave to attend a baptism among "them Dissenters;" but unless she had asked permission,
she would not have been desired to attend, so careful was the habit of her master and mistress
that she should be allowed that freedom which they claimed for themselves. But they were glad
she wished to go; they liked the feeling that all were of one household, and that the interests
of one were the interests of all. It produced a consequence, however, which they did not anticipate.
Sally was full of the event which her presence was to sanction, and, as it were, to redeem
from the character of being utterly schismatic; she spoke about it with an air of patronage
to three or four, and among them to some of the servants at Mr Bradshaw's.

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson was rather surprised to receive a call from Jemima Bradshaw, on the very morning
of the day on which little Leonard was to be baptized; Miss Bradshaw was rosy and breathless
with eagerness. Although the second in the family, she had been at school when her younger
sisters had been christened, and she was now come, in the full warmth of a girl's fancy, to
ask if she might be present at the afternoon's service. She had been struck with Mrs Denbigh's
grace and beauty at the very first sight, when she had accompanied her mother to call upon
the Bensons on their return from Wales; and had kept up an enthusiastic interest in the widow
only a little older than herself, whose very reserve and retirement but added to her unconscious
power of enchantment.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Miss Benson! I never saw a christening; papa says I may go, if you think Mr Benson and
Mrs Denbigh would not dislike it; and I will be quite quiet, and sit up behind the door, or
anywhere; and that sweet little baby! I should so like to see him christened; is he to be called
Leonard, did you say? After Mr Denbigh, is it?"

This is an atom: 
"No--not exactly," said Miss Benson, rather discomfited.

This is an atom: 
"Was not Mr Denbigh's name Leonard, then? Mamma thought it would be sure to be called after
him, and so did I. But I may come to the christening, may I not, dear Miss Benson?"

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson gave her consent with a little inward reluctance. Both her brother and Ruth shared
in this feeling, although no one expressed it; and it was presently forgotten.

This is an atom: 
Jemima stood grave and quiet in the old-fashioned vestry adjoining the chapel, as they entered
with steps subdued to slowness. She thought Ruth looked so pale and awed because she was left
a solitary parent; but Ruth came to the presence of God, as one who had gone astray, and doubted
her own worthiness to be called His child; she came as a mother who had incurred a heavy responsibility,
and who entreated His almighty aid to enable her to discharge it; full of passionate, yearning
love which craved for more faith in God, to still her distrust and fear of the future that
might hang over her darling. When she thought of her boy, she sickened and trembled; but when
she heard of God's loving-kindness, far beyond all tender mother's love, she was hushed into
peace and prayer. There she stood, her fair pale cheek resting on her baby's head, as he slumbered
on her bosom; her eyes went slanting down under their half-closed white lids; but their gaze
was not on the primitive cottage-like room, it was earnestly fixed on a dim mist, through which
she fain would have seen the life that lay before her child; but the mist was still and dense,
too thick a veil for anxious human love to penetrate. The future was hid with God.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson stood right under the casement window that was placed high up in the room; he was
almost in shade, except for one or two marked lights which fell on hair already silvery white;
his voice was always low and musical when he spoke to few; it was too weak to speak so as to
be heard by many without becoming harsh and strange; but now it filled the little room with
a loving sound, like the stock-dove's brooding murmur over her young. He and Ruth forgot all
in their earnestness of thought; and when he said "Let us pray," and the little congregation
knelt down, you might have heard the baby's faint breathing, scarcely sighing out upon the
stillness, so absorbed were all in the solemnity. But the prayer was long; thought followed
thought, and fear crowded upon fear, and all were to be laid bare before God, and His aid and
counsel asked. Before the end Sally had shuffled quietly out of the vestry into the green chapel-yard,
upon which the door opened. Miss Benson was alive to this movement, and so full of curiosity
as to what it might mean that she could no longer attend to her brother, and felt inclined
to rush off and question Sally the moment all was ended. Miss Bradshaw hung about the babe
and Ruth, and begged to be allowed to carry the child home, but Ruth pressed him to her, as
if there was no safe harbour for him but in his mother's breast. Mr Benson saw her feeling,
and caught Miss Bradshaw's look of disappointment.

This is an atom: 
"Come home with us," said he, "and stay to tea. You have never drank tea with us since you
went to school."

This is an atom: 
"I wish I might," said Miss Bradshaw, colouring with pleasure. "But I must ask papa. May I
run home and ask?"

This is an atom: 
"To be sure, my dear!"

This is an atom: 
Jemima flew off; and fortunately her father was at home; for her mother's permission would
have been deemed insufficient. She received many directions about her behaviour.

This is an atom: 
"Take no sugar in your tea, Jemima. I am sure the Bensons ought not to be able to afford sugar,
with their means. And do not eat much; you can have plenty at home on your return; remember
Mrs Denbigh's keep must cost them a great deal."

This is an atom: 
So Jemima returned considerably sobered, and very much afraid of her hunger leading her to
forget Mr Benson's poverty. Meanwhile Miss Benson and Sally, acquainted with Mr Benson's invitation
to Jemima, set about making some capital tea-cakes on which they piqued themselves. They both
enjoyed the offices of hospitality; and were glad to place some home-made tempting dainty before
their guests.

This is an atom: 
"What made ye leave the chapel-vestry before my brother had ended?" inquired Miss Benson.

This is an atom: 
"Indeed, ma'am, I thought master had prayed so long he'd be drouthy. So I just slipped out
to put on the kettle for tea."

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson was on the point of reprimanding her for thinking of anything besides the object
of the prayer, when she remembered how she herself had been unable to attend after Sally's
departure for wondering what had become of her; so she was silent.

This is an atom: 
It was a disappointment to Miss Benson's kind and hospitable expectation when Jemima, as hungry
as a hound, confined herself to one piece of the cake which her hostess had had such pleasure
in making. And Jemima wished she had not a prophetic feeling all tea-time of the manner in
which her father would inquire into the particulars of the meal, elevating his eyebrows at
every viand named beyond plain bread-and-butter, and winding up with some such sentence as
this: "Well, I marvel how, with Benson's salary, he can afford to keep such a table." Sally
could have told of self-denial when no one was by, when the left hand did not know what the
right hand did, on the part of both her master and mistress, practised without thinking even
to themselves that it was either a sacrifice or a virtue, in order to enable them to help those
who were in need, or even to gratify Miss Benson's kind, old-fashioned feelings on such occasions
as the present, when a stranger came to the house. Her homely, affectionate pleasure in making
others comfortable, might have shown that such little occasional extravagances were not waste,
but a good work; and were not to be gauged by the standard of money-spending. This evening
her spirits were damped by Jemima's refusal to eat. Poor Jemima! the cakes were so good, and
she was so hungry; but still she refused.

This is an atom: 
While Sally was clearing away the tea-things, Miss Benson and Jemima accompanied Ruth upstairs,
when she went to put little Leonard to bed.

This is an atom: 
"A christening is a very solemn service," said Miss Bradshaw; "I had no idea it was so solemn.
Mr Benson seemed to speak as if he had a weight of care on his heart that God alone could relieve
or lighten."

This is an atom: 
"My brother feels these things very much," said Miss Benson, rather wishing to cut short the
conversation, for she had been aware of several parts in the prayer which she knew were suggested
by the peculiarity and sadness of the case before him.

This is an atom: 
"I could not quite follow him all through," continued Jemima; "what did he mean by saying,
'This child, rebuked by the world and bidden to stand apart, Thou wilt not rebuke, but wilt
suffer it to come to Thee and be blessed with Thine almighty blessing'? Why is this little
darling to be rebuked? I do not think I remember the exact words, but he said something like that."

This is an atom: 
"My dear! your gown is dripping wet! it must have dipped into the tub; let me wring it out."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, thank you! Never mind my gown!" said Jemima, hastily, and wanting to return to her question;
but just then she caught the sight of tears falling fast down the cheeks of the silent Ruth
as she bent over her child, crowing and splashing away in his tub. With a sudden consciousness
that unwittingly she had touched on some painful chord, Jemima rushed into another subject,
and was eagerly seconded by Miss Benson. The circumstance seemed to die away, and leave no
trace; but in after-years it rose, vivid and significant, before Jemima's memory. At present
it was enough for her, if Mrs Denbigh would let her serve her in every possible way. Her admiration
for beauty was keen, and little indulged at home; and Ruth was very beautiful in her quiet
mournfulness; her mean and homely dress left herself only the more open to admiration, for
she gave it a charm by her unconscious wearing of it that made it seem like the drapery of
an old Greek statue--subordinate to the figure it covered, yet imbued by it with an unspeakable
grace. Then the pretended circumstances of her life were such as to catch the imagination of
a young romantic girl. Altogether, Jemima could have kissed her hand and professed herself
Ruth's slave. She moved away all the articles used at this little _coucher_; she folded up
Leonard's day-clothes; she felt only too much honoured when Ruth trusted him to her for a few
minutes--only too amply rewarded when Ruth thanked her with a grave, sweet smile, and a grateful
look of her loving eyes.

This is an atom: 
When Jemima had gone away with the servant who was sent to fetch her, there was a little chorus
of praise.

This is an atom: 
"She's a warm-hearted girl," said Miss Benson. "She remembers all the old days before she went
to school. She is worth two of Mr Richard. They're each of them just the same as they were
when they were children, when they broke that window in the chapel, and he ran away home, and
she came knocking at our door, with a single knock, just like a beggar's, and I went to see
who it was, and was quite startled to see her round, brown, honest face looking up at me, half-frightened,
and telling me what she had done, and offering me the money in her savings bank to pay for
it. We never should have heard of Master Richard's share in the business if it had not been
for Sally."

This is an atom: 
"But remember," said Mr Benson, "how strict Mr Bradshaw has always been with his children.
It is no wonder if poor Richard was a coward in those days."

This is an atom: 
"He is now, or I'm much mistaken," answered Miss Benson. "And Mr Bradshaw was just as strict
with Jemima, and she's no coward. But I've no faith in Richard. He has a look about him that
I don't like. And when Mr Bradshaw was away on business in Holland last year, for those months
my young gentleman did not come half as regularly to chapel, and I always believe that story
of his being seen out with the hounds at Smithiles."

This is an atom: 
"Those are neither of them great offences in a young man of twenty," said Mr Benson, smiling.

This is an atom: 
"No! I don't mind them in themselves; but when he could change back so easily to being regular
and mim when his father came home, I don't like that."

This is an atom: 
"Leonard shall never be afraid of me," said Ruth, following her own train of thought. "I will
be his friend from the very first; and I will try and learn how to be a wise friend, and you
will teach me, won't you, sir?"

This is an atom: 
"What made you wish to call him Leonard, Ruth?" asked Miss Benson.

This is an atom: 
"It was my mother's father's name; and she used to tell me about him and his goodness, and
I thought if Leonard could be like him--"

This is an atom: 
"Do you remember the discussion there was about Miss Bradshaw's name, Thurstan? Her father
wanting her to be called Hepzibah, but insisting that she was to have a Scripture name at any
rate; and Mrs Bradshaw wanting her to be Juliana, after some novel she had read not long before;
and at last Jemima was fixed upon, because it would do either for a Scripture name or a name
for a heroine out of a book."

This is an atom: 
"I did not know Jemima was a Scripture name," said Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"Oh yes, it is. One of Job's daughters; Jemima, Kezia, and Keren-Happuch. There are a good
many Jemimas in the world, and some Kezias, but I never heard of a Keren-Happuch; and yet we
know just as much of one as of another. People really like a pretty name, whether in Scripture
or out of it."

This is an atom: 
"When there is no particular association with the name," said Mr Benson.

This is an atom: 
"Now, I was called Faith after the cardinal virtue; and I like my name, though many people
would think it too Puritan; that was according to our gentle mother's pious desire. And Thurstan
was called by his name because my father wished it; for, although he was what people called
a radical and a democrat in his ways of talking and thinking, he was very proud in his heart
of being descended from some old Sir Thurstan, who figured away in the French wars."

This is an atom: 
"The difference between theory and practice, thinking and being," put in Mr Benson, who was
in a mood for allowing himself a little social enjoyment. He leant back in his chair, with
his eyes looking at, but not seeing the ceiling. Miss Benson was clicking away with her eternal
knitting-needles, looking at her brother, and seeing him, too. Ruth was arranging her child's
clothes against the morrow. It was but their usual way of spending an evening; the variety
was given by the different tone which the conversation assumed on the different nights. Yet,
somehow, the peacefulness of the time, the window open into the little garden, the scents that
came stealing in, and the clear summer heaven above, made the time be remembered as a happy
festival by Ruth. Even Sally seemed more placid than usual when she came in to prayers; and
she and Miss Benson followed Ruth to her bedroom, to look at the beautiful sleeping Leonard.

This is an atom: 
"God bless him!" said Miss Benson, stooping down to kiss his little dimpled hand, which lay
outside the coverlet, tossed abroad in the heat of the evening.

This is an atom: 
"Now, don't get up too early, Ruth! Injuring your health will be short-sighted wisdom and poor
economy. Good night!"

This is an atom: 
"Good night, dear Miss Benson. Good night, Sally." When Ruth had shut her door, she went again
to the bed, and looked at her boy till her eyes filled with tears.

This is an atom: 
"God bless thee, darling! I only ask to be one of His instruments, and not thrown aside as
useless--or worse than useless."

This is an atom: 
So ended the day of Leonard's christening.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson had sometimes taught the children of different people as an especial favour, when
requested by them. But then his pupils were only children, and by their progress he was little
prepared for Ruth's. She had had early teaching, of that kind which need never be unlearnt,
from her mother; enough to unfold many of her powers; they had remained inactive now for several
years, but had grown strong in the dark and quiet time. Her tutor was surprised at the bounds
by which she surmounted obstacles, the quick perception and ready adaptation of truths and
first principles, and her immediate sense of the fitness of things. Her delight in what was
strong and beautiful called out her master's sympathy; but, most of all, he admired the complete
unconsciousness of uncommon power, or unusual progress. It was less of a wonder than he considered
it to be, it is true, for she never thought of comparing what she was now with her former self,
much less with another. Indeed, she did not think of herself at all, but of her boy, and what
she must learn in order to teach him to be and to do as suited her hope and her prayer. If
any one's devotion could have flattered her into self-consciousness, it was Jemima's. Mr Bradshaw
never dreamed that his daughter could feel herself inferior to the minister's _protegÃ©e_, but
so it was; and no knight-errant of old could consider himself more honoured by his ladye's
commands than did Jemima, if Ruth allowed her to do anything for her or for her boy. Ruth loved
her heartily, even while she was rather annoyed at the open expressions Jemima used of admiration.

This is an atom: 
"Please, I really would rather not be told if people do think me pretty."

This is an atom: 
"But it was not merely beautiful; it was sweet-looking and good, Mrs Postlethwaite called you,"
replied Jemima.

This is an atom: 
"All the more I would rather not hear it. I may be pretty, but I know I am not good. Besides,
I don't think we ought to hear what is said of us behind our backs."

This is an atom: 
Ruth spoke so gravely, that Jemima feared lest she was displeased.

This is an atom: 
"Dear Mrs Denbigh, I never will admire or praise you again. Only let me love you."

This is an atom: 
"And let me love you!" said Ruth, with a tender kiss.

This is an atom: 
Jemima would not have been allowed to come so frequently if Mr Bradshaw had not been possessed
with the idea of patronising Ruth. If the latter had chosen, she might have gone dressed from
head to foot in the presents which he wished to make her, but she refused them constantly;
occasionally to Miss Benson's great annoyance. But if he could not load her with gifts, he
could show his approbation by asking her to his house; and after some deliberation, she consented
to accompany Mr and Miss Benson there. The house was square and massy-looking, with a great
deal of drab-colour about the furniture. Mrs Bradshaw, in her lackadaisical, sweet-tempered
way, seconded her husband in his desire of being kind to Ruth; and as she cherished privately
a great taste for what was beautiful or interesting, as opposed to her husband's love of the
purely useful, this taste of hers had rarely had so healthy and true a mode of gratification
as when she watched Ruth's movements about the room, which seemed in its unobtrusiveness and
poverty of colour to receive the requisite ornament of light and splendour from Ruth's presence.
Mrs Bradshaw sighed, and wished she had a daughter as lovely, about whom to weave a romance;
for castle-building, after the manner of the Minerva press, was the outlet by which she escaped
from the pressure of her prosaic life, as Mr Bradshaw's wife. Her perception was only of external
beauty, and she was not always alive to that, or she might have seen how a warm, affectionate,
ardent nature, free from all envy or carking care of self, gave an unspeakable charm to her
plain, bright-faced daughter Jemima, whose dark eyes kept challenging admiration for her friend.
The first evening spent at Mr Bradshaw's passed like many succeeding visits there. There was
tea, the equipage for which was as handsome and as ugly as money could purchase. Then the ladies
produced their sewing, while Mr Bradshaw stood before the fire, and gave the assembled party
the benefit of his opinions on many subjects. The opinions were as good and excellent as the
opinions of any man can be who sees one side of a case very strongly, and almost ignores the
other. They coincided in many points with those held by Mr Benson, but he once or twice interposed
with a plea for those who might differ; and then he was heard by Mr Bradshaw with a kind of
evident and indulgent pity, such as one feels for a child who unwittingly talks nonsense. By-and-by,
Mrs Bradshaw and Miss Benson fell into one _tÃªte Ã  tÃªte_, and Ruth and Jemima into another.
Two well-behaved but unnaturally quiet children were sent to bed early in the evening, in an
authoritative voice, by their father, because one of them had spoken too loud while he was
enlarging on an alteration in the tariff. Just before the supper-tray was brought in, a gentleman
was announced whom Ruth had never previously seen, but who appeared well known to the rest
of the party. It was Mr Farquhar, Mr Bradshaw's partner; he had been on the Continent for the
last year, and had only recently returned. He seemed perfectly at home, but spoke little. He
leaned back in his chair, screwed up his eyes, and watched everybody; yet there was nothing
unpleasant or impertinent in his keenness of observation. Ruth wondered to hear him contradict
Mr Bradshaw, and almost expected some rebuff; but Mr Bradshaw, if he did not yield the point,
admitted, for the first time that evening, that it was possible something might be said on
the other side. Mr Farquhar differed also from Mr Benson, but it was in a more respectful manner
than Mr Bradshaw had done. For these reasons, although Mr Farquhar had never spoken to Ruth,
she came away with the impression that he was a man to be respected, and perhaps liked.

This is an atom: 
Sally would have thought herself mightily aggrieved if, on their return, she had not heard
some account of the evening. As soon as Miss Benson came in, the old servant began:

This is an atom: 
"Well, and who was there? and what did they give you for supper?"

This is an atom: 
"Only Mr Farquhar besides ourselves; and sandwiches, sponge-cake, and wine; there was no occasion
for anything more," replied Miss Benson, who was tired and preparing to go upstairs.

This is an atom: 
"Mr Farquhar! Why they do say he's thinking of Miss Jemima!"

This is an atom: 
"Nonsense, Sally! why he's old enough to be her father!" said Miss Benson, half way up the
first flight.

This is an atom: 
"There's no need for it to be called nonsense, though he may be ten year older," muttered Sally,
retreating towards the kitchen. "Bradshaw's Betsy knows what she's about, and wouldn't have
said it for nothing."

This is an atom: 
Ruth wondered a little about it. She loved Jemima well enough to be interested in what related
to her; but, after thinking for a few minutes, she decided that such a marriage was, and would
ever be, very unlikely.

CHAPTER XVIII

This is an atom: 
Ruth Becomes a Governess in Mr Bradshaw's Family

This is an atom: 
One afternoon, not long after this, Mr and Miss Benson set off to call upon a farmer, who attended
the chapel, but lived at some distance from the town. They intended to stay to tea if they
were invited, and Ruth and Sally were left to spend a long afternoon together. At first, Sally
was busy in her kitchen, and Ruth employed herself in carrying her baby out into the garden.
It was now nearly a year since she came to the Bensons'; it seemed like yesterday, and yet
as if a lifetime had gone between. The flowers were budding now, that were all in bloom when
she came down, on the first autumnal morning, into the sunny parlour. The yellow jessamine,
that was then a tender plant, had now taken firm root in the soil, and was sending out strong
shoots; the wall-flowers, which Miss Benson had sown on the wall a day or two after her arrival,
were scenting the air with their fragrant flowers. Ruth knew every plant now; it seemed as
though she had always lived here, and always known the inhabitants of the house. She heard
Sally singing her accustomed song in the kitchen, a song she never varied over her afternoon's
work. It began,

This is an atom: 
As I was going to Derby, sir,
     Upon a market-day.

This is an atom: 
And if music is a necessary element in a song, perhaps I had better call it by some other name.

This is an atom: 
But the strange change was in Ruth herself. She was conscious of it though she could not define
it, and did not dwell upon it. Life had become significant and full of duty to her. She delighted
in the exercise of her intellectual powers, and liked the idea of the infinite amount of which
she was ignorant; for it was a grand pleasure to learn--to crave, and be satisfied. She strove
to forget what had gone before this last twelve months. She shuddered up from contemplating
it; it was like a bad, unholy dream. And yet, there was a strange yearning kind of love for
the father of the child whom she pressed to her heart, which came, and she could not bid it
begone as sinful, it was so pure and natural, even when thinking of it, as in the sight of
God. Little Leonard cooed to the flowers, and stretched after their bright colours; and Ruth
laid him on the dry turf, and pelted him with the gay petals. He chinked and crowed with laughing
delight, and clutched at her cap, and pulled it off. Her short rich curls were golden-brown
in the slanting sunlight, and by their very shortness made her look more child-like. She hardly
seemed as if she could be the mother of the noble babe over whom she knelt, now snatching kisses,
now matching his cheek with rose-leaves. All at once, the bells of the old church struck the
hour; and far away, high up in the air, began slowly to play the old tune of "Life let us cherish;"
they had played it for years--for the life of man--and it always sounded fresh and strange
and aÃ«rial. Ruth was still in a moment, she knew not why; and the tears came into her eyes
as she listened. When it was ended, she kissed her baby, and bade God bless him.

This is an atom: 
Just then Sally came out, dressed for the evening, with a leisurely look about her. She had
done her work, and she and Ruth were to drink tea together in the exquisitely clean kitchen;
but while the kettle was boiling, she came out to enjoy the flowers. She gathered a piece of
southern-wood, and stuffed it up her nose, by way of smelling it.

This is an atom: 
"Whatten you call this in your country?" asked she.

This is an atom: 
"Old-man," replied Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"We call it here lad's-love. It and peppermint-drops always remind me of going to church in
the country. Here! I'll get you a black-currant leaf to put in the teapot. It gives it a flavour.
We had bees once against this wall; but when missus died, we forgot to tell 'em, and put 'em
in mourning, and, in course, they swarmed away without our knowing, and the next winter came
a hard frost, and they died. Now, I dare say, the water will be boiling; and it's time for
little master there to come in, for the dew is falling. See, all the daisies is shutting themselves
up."

This is an atom: 
Sally was most gracious as a hostess. She quite put on her company manners to receive Ruth
in the kitchen. They laid Leonard to sleep on the sofa in the parlour, that they might hear
him the more easily, and then they sat quietly down to their sewing by the bright kitchen fire.
Sally was, as usual, the talker; and, as usual, the subject was the family of whom for so many
years she had formed a part.

This is an atom: 
"Aye! things was different when I was a girl," quoth she. "Eggs was thirty for a shilling,
and butter only sixpence a pound. This is not always the case if the milk is carried some
distance in the hot sun, in uncovered tin cans.

This is an atom: 
The milkman always comes very early in the morning, and so does the baker. If the baker is
not on time, we must wait for our breakfast; for bread is not baked
in the house.

This is an atom: 
It is always bought.

This is an atom: 
We can hear him long before he reaches our door, for he keeps up a plaintive cry in order to
attract our attention.

This is an atom: 
Sometimes our human bread wagon carries a great board or basket on his head, and in this are
as many as fifty loaves. (See illustration, page 26).

This is an atom: 
The butcher, on horseback, brings meat hanging from hooks in frames. Much of the poultry is
brought to town in great odd wicker coops strung across the backs of ponies. Here is a poultry
vender at the street corner, with his inverted and excited merchandise suspended by strings
from his shoulder. (See page 22).

This is an atom: 
HOW THE PEOPLE TRAVEL.

This is an atom: 
Puerto Rico is a very delightful place to visit, but we do not care to go there to live until
there are better roads.

This is an atom: 
There is but one good road on the island, the one leading from San Juan to Ponce. There is only
one line of street cars (in the city of Mayaguez); and there are
only one hundred and forty-seven miles of railroad in the whole
island.

This is an atom: 
The best roads run along the coast from town to town. There is one exception. This is the wonderful
military road which connects Ponce, on the south shore, with San Juan on the north shore.
(See map, page 4).

This is an atom: 
Parts of the country away from the coasts are reached by bridle
paths; but the roads outside the cities and towns are impassable
during the rainy season.

This is an atom: 
Sometimes there is only a bridle path or trail overgrown with tangled
vegetation, and crossed by streams without bridges.

This is an atom: 
The means of transportation employed by the people are the pony carriage or surrey, the saddle
horse, the ox-cart and the foot. The beast of burden is either the
donkey or the pony.

This is an atom: 
These animals are employed to carry goods in packs over the trails,
in place of using the wagon.

This is an atom: 
The ponies are usually small, half-starved, badly treated animals. They carry great burdens,
that look heavy enough to crush them to the ground.

This is an atom: 
Their food consists of green corn and grass. One of the commonest sights on the road, street,
or marketplace is the pony with his load of green fodder.

This is an atom: 
This is usually so large that it covers the animal entirely, but
the master is always in plain view, sitting astride the moving
corn-stack.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: A PUERTO RICAN PONY LOADED.]
The planters and farmers have an odd-looking saddle, which they use
on these ponies.

This is an atom: 
It is a leather pad to which are attached wicker baskets.

This is an atom: 
The well-to-do farmers who own ponies carry fruit and vegetables in these baskets. Sometimes
two hogs are brought to market in the baskets, with all four feet tied together.

This is an atom: 
When the farmer takes his family to market, he and his wife ride the pony, and the children ride
in the baskets.
The ponies also carry bales of grass, trunks, and all kinds of
household goods, and furniture.
The principal draught animals are oxen. The heavy two-wheeled ox
cart is used to convey great loads of sugar, coffee, and tobacco
or fruit, over the good roads.
Great, strong, patient beasts they are. They are yoked by a bar of
heavy wood fastened to their horns.
They are driven, not with words or whip, but with a goad. The driver
or teamster walks in front of his team and waves his arms and goad
the way he wishes them to go.
If they do not follow fast enough to please him, he urges them along
by prodding them. The end of the goad is shod with a sharp spike
of steel, three inches or more long. Often we see these oxen dripping
with blood, and seamed and scarred with wounds.
Besides the pain of this constant goading, they suffer from flies
upon their face, nose and eyes. Since their heads are bound, they
can not shake the flies off.
All day they stand or travel in the hot sun without water or
food.
Even when they stop or rest, no one thinks of putting them in the
shade.
Almost all the people are cruel to their animals, yet they seem not
to realize that they are doing wrong. It is a custom, that is
all.
It makes us wish we might organize a society for the prevention of
cruelty.So I sits and I listens. And would you belie' me, he read it
out as if it were as clear a business as your giving me that thimble--no more ado, though it
were thirty pound! I could understand it mysel'--that were no law for me. I wanted summat to
consider about, and for th' meaning to be wrapped up as I wrap up my best gown. So says I,
'Tom! it's not on parchment. I mun have it on parchment.' 'This 'ill do as well,' says he.
'We'll get it witnessed, and it will stand good.' Well! I liked the notion of having it witnessed,
and for a while that soothed me; but after a bit, I felt I should like it done according to
law, and not plain out as anybody might ha' done it; I mysel', if I could have written. So
says I, 'Tom! I mun have it on parchment.' 'Parchment costs money,' says he, very grave. 'Oh,
oh, my lad! are ye there?' thinks I. 'That's the reason I'm clipped of law.' So says I, 'Tom!
I mun have it on parchment. I'll pay the money and welcome. It's thirty pound, and what I can
lay to it. I'll make it safe. It shall be on parchment, and I'll tell thee what, lad! I'll
gie ye sixpence for every good law-word you put in it, sounding like, and not to be caught
up as a person runs. Your master had need to be ashamed of you as a 'prentice if you can't
do a thing more tradesman-like than this!' Well! he laughed above a bit, but I were firm, and
stood to it. So he made it out on parchment. Now, woman, try and read it!" said she, giving
it to Ruth.

This is an atom: 
Ruth smiled, and began to read; Sally listening with rapt attention. When Ruth came to the
word "testatrix," Sally stopped her.

This is an atom: 
"That was the first sixpence," said she. "I thowt he was going to fob me off again wi' plain
language; but when that word came, I out wi' my sixpence, and gave it to him on the spot. Now
go on."

This is an atom: 
Presently Ruth read, "accruing."

This is an atom: 
"That was the second sixpence. Four sixpences it were in all, besides six-and-eightpence as
we bargained at first, and three-and-fourpence parchment. There! that's what I call a will;
witnessed according to law, and all. Master Thurstan will be prettily taken in when I die,
and he finds all his extra wage left back to him. But it will teach him it's not so easy as
he thinks for, to make a woman give up her way."

This is an atom: 
The time was now drawing near when little Leonard might be weaned--the time appointed by all
three for Ruth to endeavour to support herself in some way more or less independent of Mr and
Miss Benson. This prospect dwelt much in all of their minds, and was in each shaded with some
degree of perplexity; but they none of them spoke of it for fear of accelerating the event.
If they had felt clear and determined as to the best course to be pursued, they were none of
them deficient in courage to commence upon that course at once. Miss Benson would, perhaps,
have objected the most to any alteration in their present daily mode of life; but that was
because she had the habit of speaking out her thoughts as they arose, and she particularly
disliked and dreaded change. Besides this, she had felt her heart open out, and warm towards
the little helpless child, in a strong and powerful manner. Nature had intended her warm instincts
to find vent in a mother's duties; her heart had yearned after children, and made her restless
in her childless state, without her well knowing why; but now, the delight she experienced
in tending, nursing, and contriving for the little boy--even contriving to the point of sacrificing
many of her cherished whims--made her happy and satisfied and peaceful. It was more difficult
to sacrifice her whims than her comforts; but all had been given up when and where required
by the sweet lordly baby, who reigned paramount in his very helplessness.

This is an atom: 
From some cause or other, an exchange of ministers for one Sunday was to be effected with a
neighbouring congregation, and Mr Benson went on a short absence from home. When he returned
on Monday, he was met at the house-door by his sister, who had evidently been looking out for
him for some time. She stepped out to greet him.

This is an atom: 
"Don't hurry yourself, Thurstan! all's well; only I wanted to tell you something. Don't fidget
yourself--baby is quite well, bless him! It's only good news. Come into your room, and let
me talk a little quietly with you."

This is an atom: 
She drew him into his study, which was near the outer door, and then she took off his coat,
and put his carpet-bag in a corner, and wheeled a chair to the fire, before she would begin.

This is an atom: 
"Well, now! to think how often things fall out just as we want them, Thurstan! Have not you
often wondered what was to be done with Ruth when the time came at which we promised her she
should earn her living? I am sure you have, because I have so often thought about it myself.
And yet I never dared to speak out my fear, because that seemed giving it a shape. And now
Mr Bradshaw has put all to rights. He invited Mr Jackson to dinner yesterday, just as we were
going into chapel; and then he turned to me and asked me if I would come to tea--straight from
afternoon chapel, because Mrs Bradshaw wanted to speak to me. He made it very clear I was not
to bring Ruth; and, indeed, she was only too happy to stay at home with baby. And so I went;
and Mrs Bradshaw took me into her bedroom, and shut the doors, and said Mr Bradshaw had told
her, that he did not like Jemima being so much confined with the younger ones while they were
at their lessons, and that he wanted some one above a nursemaid to sit with them while their
masters were there--some one who would see about their learning their lessons, and who would
walk out with them; a sort of nursery governess, I think she meant, though she did not say
so; and Mr Bradshaw (for, of course, I saw his thoughts and words constantly peeping out, though
he had told her to speak to me) believed that our Ruth would be the very person. Now, Thurstan,
don't look so surprised, as if she had never come into your head! I am sure I saw what Mrs
Bradshaw was driving at, long before she came to the point; and I could scarcely keep from
smiling, and saying, 'We'd jump at the proposal'--long before I ought to have known anything
about it."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, I wonder what we ought to do!" said Mr Benson. "Or rather, I believe I see what we ought
to do, if I durst but do it."

This is an atom: 
"Why, what ought we to do?" asked his sister, in surprise.

This is an atom: 
While men in all branches of the American army were brave and all
did their duty, I think the airmen, like the tank men, deserve a
special meed of praise for their daring, and when I say this, I
intend in no way to detract from the bravery of the men in any other
branch of the service.

This is an atom: 
The Flash Service, to which I belonged, was not a fighting unit.

This is an atom: 
While we were heavily armed, so that we could defend ourselves and
fight if necessary, we were not, in the strict sense of the word,
combatants.

This is an atom: 
It was more important for us to keep the lines of communication in working order, to give the
artillery the range on certain objects, to locate machine gun nests and direct fire upon
them so they could be destroyed, than to fight, for there were
sufficient numbers in other branches of the army for that purpose.

This is an atom: 
But we did not overlook an opportunity to help our cause, and it
is with a great deal of pleasure that I tell of a machine gun nest
of thirteen men captured by three of the men of our detachment,
though of a different post from mine.

This is an atom: 
It was during the early morning of the first day of the drive. It should be stated that the
American infantry advanced so rapidly that it frequently went right by carefully concealed
machine gun nests. This was just what the Germans wanted them to do, because they opened
fire from the rear and rained bullets on our men from two sides.

This is an atom: 
The three men that captured the nest of which I am telling were
just in back of the second wave of infantry that went over the top,
following it up for the purpose of establishing our line of
communication from front to rear.

This is an atom: 
They came upon this nest as the Huns were preparing to fire at our advancing men.
What is
the risk to which you think you are exposing Mr Bradshaw's children?" She paused, out of breath,
her eyes glittering with tears of indignation, and impatient for an answer, that she might
knock it to pieces.

This is an atom: 
"I do not see any danger that can arise," said he at length, and with slow difficulty, as if
not fully convinced. "I have watched Ruth, and I believe she is pure and truthful; and the
very sorrow and penitence she has felt--the very suffering she has gone through--has given
her a thoughtful conscientiousness beyond her age."

This is an atom: 
"That and the care of her baby," said Miss Benson, secretly delighted at the tone of her brother's
thoughts.

This is an atom: 
"Ah, Faith! that baby you so much dreaded once, is turning out a blessing, you see," said Thurstan,
with a faint, quiet smile.

This is an atom: 
"Yes! any one might be thankful, and better too, for Leonard; but how could I tell that it
would be like him?"

This is an atom: 
"But to return to Ruth and Mr Bradshaw. What did you say?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh! with my feelings, of course, I was only too glad to accept the proposal, and so I told
Mrs Bradshaw then; and I afterwards repeated it to Mr Bradshaw, when he asked me if his wife
had mentioned their plans. They would understand that I must consult you and Ruth, before it
could be considered as finally settled."

This is an atom: 
"And have you named it to her?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes," answered Miss Benson, half afraid lest he should think she had been too precipitate.

This is an atom: 
"And what did she say?" asked he, after a little pause of grave silence.

This is an atom: 
"At first she seemed very glad, and fell into my mood of planning how it should all be managed;
how Sally and I should take care of the baby the hours that she was away at Mr Bradshaw's;
but by-and-by she became silent and thoughtful, and knelt down by me and hid her face in my
lap, and shook a little as if she was crying; and then I heard her speak in a very low smothered
voice, for her head was still bent down--quite hanging down, indeed, so that I could not see
her face, so I stooped to listen, and I heard her say, 'Do you think I should be good enough
to teach little girls, Miss Benson?' She said it so humbly and fearfully that all I thought
of was how to cheer her, and I answered and asked her if she did not hope to be good enough
to bring up her own darling to be a brave Christian man? And she lifted up her head, and I
saw her eyes looking wild and wet and earnest, and she said, 'With God's help, that will I
try to make my child.' And I said then, 'Ruth, as you strive and as you pray for your own child,
so you must strive and pray to make Mary and Elizabeth good, if you are trusted with them.'
And she said out quite clear, though her face was hidden from me once more, 'I will strive,
and I will pray.' You would not have had any fears, Thurstan, if you could have heard and seen
her last night."

This is an atom: 
"I have no fear," said he, decidedly. "Let the plan go on." After a minute, he added, "But
I am glad it was so far arranged before I heard of it. My indecision about right and wrong--my
perplexity as to how far we are to calculate consequences--grows upon me, I fear."

This is an atom: 
"You look tired and weary, dear. You should blame your body rather than your conscience at
these times."

This is an atom: 
"A very dangerous doctrine."

This is an atom: 
The scroll of Fate was closed, and they could not foresee the Future; and yet, if they could
have seen it, though they might have shrunk fearfully at first, they would have smiled and
thanked God when all was done and said.

CHAPTER XIX

This is an atom: 
After Five Years

This is an atom: 
The quiet days grew into weeks and months, and even years, without any event to startle the
little circle into the consciousness of the lapse of time. One who had known them at the date
of Ruth's becoming a governess in Mr Bradshaw's family, and had been absent until the time
of which I am now going to tell you, would have noted some changes which had imperceptibly
come over all; but he, too, would have thought, that the life which had brought so little of
turmoil and vicissitude must have been calm and tranquil, and in accordance with the bygone
activity of the town in which their existence passed away.

This is an atom: 
The alterations that he would have perceived were those caused by the natural progress of time.
The Benson home was brightened into vividness by the presence of the little Leonard, now a
noble boy of six, large and grand in limb and stature, and with a face of marked beauty and
intelligence. Indeed, he might have been considered by many as too intelligent for his years;
and often the living with old and thoughtful people gave him, beyond most children, the appearance
of pondering over the mysteries which meet the young on the threshold of life, but which fade
away as advancing years bring us more into contact with the practical and tangible--fade away
and vanish, until it seems to require the agitation of some great storm of the soul before
we can again realise spiritual things.

This is an atom: 
But, at times, Leonard seemed oppressed and bewildered, after listening intent, with grave
and wondering eyes, to the conversation around him; at others, the bright animal life shone
forth radiant, and no three-months' kitten--no foal, suddenly tossing up its heels by the side
of its sedate dam, and careering around the pasture in pure mad enjoyment--no young creature
of any kind, could show more merriment and gladness of heart.

This is an atom: 
"For ever in mischief," was Sally's account of him at such times; but it was not intentional
mischief; and Sally herself would have been the first to scold any one else who had used the
same words in reference to her darling. II
There was a time when I thought much of Fame, And laid the golden edifice to be That in the clear
light of eternity Should fitly house the glory of my name.

This is an atom: 
But swifter than my fingers pushed their plan, Over the fair foundation scarce begun, While
I with lovers dallied in the sun, The ivy clambered and the rose-vine ran.

This is an atom: 
And now, too late to see my vision, rise, In place of golden pinnacles and towers, Only some
sunny mounds of leaves and flowers, Only beloved of birds and butterflies.

This is an atom: 
My friends were duped, my favorers deceived; But sometimes, musing sorrowfully there, That
flowered wreck has seemed to me so fair I scarce regret the temple unachieved.

This is an atom: 
III
For there were nights . . . my love to him whose brow Has glistened with the spoils of nights
like those, Home turning as a conqueror turns home, What time green dawn down every street
uprears Arches of triumph! He has drained as well Joy's perfumed bowl and cried as I have
cried: Be Fame their mistress whom Love passes by. This only matters: from some flowery bed,
Laden with sweetness like a homing bee, If one have known what bliss it is to come, Bearing
on hands and breast and laughing lips The fragrance of his youth's dear rose. To him The
hills have bared their treasure, the far clouds Unveiled the vision
that o'er summer seas Drew on his thirsting arms.

This is an atom: 
This last thing known, He can court danger, laugh at perilous odds, And, pillowed on a memory
so sweet, Unto oblivious eternity Without regret yield his victorious soul, The blessed pilgrim
of a vow fulfilled.

This is an atom:

What is Success? Out of the endless ore Of deep desire to coin the utmost gold Of passionate
memory; to have lived so well That the fifth moon, when it swims up once more Through orchard
boughs where mating orioles build And apple flowers unfold, Find not of that dear need that
all things tell The heart unburdened nor the arms unfilled.

This is an atom: 
O Love, whereof my boyhood was the dream, My youth the beautiful novitiate, Life was so slight a
thing and thou so great, How could I make thee less than all-supreme! In thy sweet transports
not alone I thought Mingled the twain that panted breast to breast.

This is an atom: 
The sun and stars throbbed with them; they were caught Into the pulse of Nature and possessed
By the same light that consecrates it so. Love!

This is an atom: 
--'tis the payment of the debt we owe The beauty of the world, and
whensoe'er In silks and perfume and unloosened hair The loveliness
of lovers, face to face, Lies folded in the adorable embrace, Doubt
not as of a perfect sacrifice That soul partakes whose inspiration
fills The springtime and the depth of summer skies, The rainbow and
the clouds behind the hills, That excellence in earth and air and
sea That makes things as they are the real divinity.

This is an atom: 
Thirty Sonnets:

This is an atom: 
Sonnet I
Down the strait vistas where a city street Fades in pale dust and
vaporous distances, Stained with far fumes the light grows less and
less And the sky reddens round the day's retreat.

This is an atom: 
Now out of orient chambers, cool and sweet, Like Nature's pure lustration, Dusk comes down.
Now the lamps brighten and the quickening town Rings with the trample of returning feet. And
Pleasure, risen from her own warm mould Sunk all the drowsy and unloved daylight In layers
of odorous softness, Paphian girls Cover with gauze, with satin, and with pearls, Crown, and about
her spangly vestments fold The ermine of the empire of the
Night.

This is an atom: 
Sonnet II
Her courts are by the flux of flaming ways, Between the rivers and
the illumined sky Whose fervid depths reverberate from on high
Fierce lustres mingled in a fiery haze. They mark it inland; blithe
and fair of face Her suitors follow, guessing by the glare Beyond
the hilltops in the evening air How bright the cressets at her
portals blaze.I've not been reading my chapters every night for fifty year
to be caught napping by a Dissenter, neither!" said she, triumphantly. "Come along, Leonard."
She stretched out her hand to the child, thinking that she had conquered.

This is an atom: 
But Leonard did not stir. He looked wistfully at Mr Benson. "Come!" said she, impatiently.
The boy's mouth quivered.

This is an atom: 
"If you want to whip me, uncle, you may do it. I don't much mind."

This is an atom: 
Put in this form, it was impossible to carry out his intentions; and so Mr Benson told the
lad he might go--that he would speak to him another time. Leonard went away, more subdued in
spirit than if he had been whipped. Sally lingered a moment. She stopped to add: "I think it's
for them without sin to throw stones at a poor child, and cut up good laburnum-branches to
whip him. I only do as my betters do, when I call Leonard's mother Mrs Denbigh." The moment
she had said this she was sorry; it was an ungenerous advantage after the enemy had acknowledged
himself defeated. Mr Benson dropped his head upon his hands, and hid his face, and sighed deeply.

This is an atom: 
Leonard flew in search of his mother, as in search of a refuge. If he had found her calm, he
would have burst into a passion of crying after his agitation; as it was, he came upon her
kneeling and sobbing, and he stood quite still. Then he threw his arms round her neck, and
said: "Mamma! mamma! I will be good--I make a promise; I will speak true--I make a promise."
And he kept his word.

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson piqued herself upon being less carried away by her love for this child than any
one else in the house; she talked severely, and had capital theories; but her severity ended
in talk, and her theories would not work. However, she read several books on education, knitting
socks for Leonard all the while; and, upon the whole, I think, the hands were more usefully
employed than the head, and the good honest heart better than either. She looked older than
when we first knew her, but it was a ripe, kindly age that was coming over her. Her excellent
practical sense, perhaps, made her a more masculine character than her brother. He was often
so much perplexed by the problems of life, that he let the time for action go by; but she kept
him in check by her clear, pithy talk, which brought back his wandering thoughts to the duty
that lay straight before him, waiting for action; and then he remembered that it was the faithful
part to "wait patiently upon God," and leave the ends in His hands, who alone knows why Evil
exists in this world, and why it ever hovers on either side of Good. In this respect, Miss
Benson had more faith than her brother--or so it seemed; for quick, resolute action in the
next step of Life was all she required, while he deliberated and trembled, and often did wrong
from his very deliberation, when his first instinct would have led him right.

This is an atom: 
But although decided and prompt as ever, Miss Benson was grown older since the summer afternoon
when she dismounted from the coach at the foot of the long Welsh hill that led to Llan-dhu,
where her brother awaited her to consult her about Ruth. Though her eye was as bright and straight-looking
as ever, quick and brave in its glances, her hair had become almost snowy white; and it was
on this point she consulted Sally, soon after the date of Leonard's last untruth. The two were
arranging Miss Benson's room one morning, when, after dusting the looking-glass, she suddenly
stopped in her operation, and after a close inspection of herself, startled Sally by this speech:

This is an atom: 
"Sally! I'm looking a great deal older than I used to do!"

This is an atom: 
Sally, who was busy dilating on the increased price of flour, considered this remark of Miss
Benson's as strangely irrelevant to the matter in hand, and only noticed it by a

This is an atom: 
"To be sure! I suppose we all on us do. But two-and-fourpence a dozen is too much to make us
pay for it."

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson went on with her inspection of herself, and Sally with her economical projects.

This is an atom: 
"Sally!" said Miss Benson, "my hair is nearly white. The last time I looked it was only pepper-and-salt.
What must I do?"

This is an atom: 
"Do--why, what would the wench do?" asked Sally, contemptuously. "Ye're never going to be taken
in, at your time of life, by hair-dyes and such gimcracks, as can only take in young girls
whose wisdom-teeth are not cut."

This is an atom: 
"And who are not very likely to want them," said Miss Benson, quietly. "No! but you see, Sally,
it's very awkward having such grey hair, and feeling so young. Do you know, Sally, I've as
great a mind for dancing, when I hear a lively tune on the street-organs, as ever; and as great
a mind to sing when I'm happy--to sing in my old way, Sally, you know."

This is an atom: 
"Aye, you had it from a girl," said Sally; "and many a time, when the door's been shut, I did
not know if it was you in the parlour, or a big bumble-bee in the kitchen, as was making that
drumbling noise. I heard you at it yesterday."

This is an atom: 
"But an old woman with grey hair ought not to have a fancy for dancing or singing," continued
Miss Benson.

This is an atom: 
"Whatten nonsense are ye talking?" said Sally, roused to indignation. "Calling yoursel' an
old woman when you're better than ten years younger than me! and many a girl has grey hair
at five-and-twenty."

This is an atom: 
"But I'm more than five-and-twenty, Sally. I'm fifty-seven next May!"

This is an atom: 
"More shame for ye, then, not to know better than to talk of dyeing your hair. I cannot abide
such vanities!"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, dear! Sally, when will you understand what I mean? I want to know how I am to keep remembering
how old I am, so as to prevent myself from feeling so young? I was quite startled just now
to see my hair in the glass, for I can generally tell if my cap is straight by feeling. I'll
tell you what I'll do--I'll cut off a piece of my grey hair, and plait it together for a marker
in my Bible!" Miss Benson expected applause for this bright idea, but Sally only made answer:

This is an atom: 
"You'll be taking to painting your cheeks next, now you've once thought of dyeing your hair."
So Miss Benson plaited her grey hair in silence and quietness, Leonard holding one end of it
while she wove it, and admiring the colour and texture all the time, with a sort of implied
dissatisfaction at the auburn colour of his own curls, which was only half-comforted away by
Miss Benson's information, that, if he lived long enough, his hair would be like hers.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson, who had looked old and frail while he was yet but young, was now stationary as to
the date of his appearance. But there was something more of nervous restlessness in his voice
and ways than formerly; that was the only change six years had brought to him. And as for Sally,
she chose to forget age and the passage of years altogether, and had as much work in her, to
use her own expression, as she had at sixteen; nor was her appearance very explicit as to the
flight of time. Fifty, sixty, or seventy, she might be--not more than the last, not less than
the first--though her usual answer to any circuitous inquiry as to her age was now (what it
had been for many years past), "I'm feared I shall never see thirty again."

This is an atom: 
Then as to the house. It was not one where the sitting-rooms are refurnished every two or three
years; not now, even (since Ruth came to share their living) a place where, as an article grew
shabby or worn, a new one was purchased. The furniture looked poor, and the carpets almost
threadbare; but there was such a dainty spirit of cleanliness abroad, such exquisite neatness
of repair, and altogether so bright and cheerful a look about the rooms--everything so above-board--no
shifts to conceal poverty under flimsy ornament--that many a splendid drawing-room would give
less pleasure to those who could see evidences of character in inanimate things. But whatever
poverty there might be in the house, there was full luxuriance in the little square wall-encircled
garden, on two sides of which the parlour and kitchen looked. The laburnum-tree, which when
Ruth came was like a twig stuck into the ground, was now a golden glory in spring, and a pleasant
shade in summer. The wild hop, that Mr Benson had brought home from one of his country rambles,
and planted by the parlour-window, while Leonard was yet a baby in his mother's arms, was now
a garland over the casement, hanging down long tendrils, that waved in the breezes, and threw
pleasant shadows and traceries, like some Bacchanalian carving, on the parlour-walls, at "morn
or dusky eve." The yellow rose had clambered up to the window of Mr Benson's bedroom, and its
blossom-laden branches were supported by a jargonelle pear-tree rich in autumnal fruit.

This is an atom: 
But, perhaps, in Ruth herself there was the greatest external change; for of the change which
had gone on in her heart, and mind, and soul, or if there had been any, neither she nor any
one around her was conscious; but sometimes Miss Benson did say to Sally, "How very handsome
Ruth is grown!" To which Sally made ungracious answer, "Yes! she's well enough. Beauty is deceitful,
and favour a snare, and I'm thankful the Lord has spared me from such man-traps and spring-guns."
But even Sally could not help secretly admiring Ruth. If her early brilliancy of colour was
gone, a clear ivory skin, as smooth as satin, told of complete and perfect health, and was
as lovely, if not so striking in effect, as the banished lilies and roses. Her hair had grown
darker and deeper, in the shadow that lingered in its masses; her eyes, even if you could have
guessed that they had shed bitter tears in their day, had a thoughtful, spiritual look about
them, that made you wonder at their depth, and look--and look again. The increase of dignity
in her face had been imparted to her form. I do not know if she had grown taller since the
birth of her child, but she looked as if she had. And although she had lived in a very humble
home, yet there was something about either it or her, or the people amongst whom she had been
thrown during the last few years, which had so changed her, that whereas, six or seven years
ago, you would have perceived that she was not altogether a lady by birth and education, yet
now she might have been placed among the highest in the land, and would have been taken by
the most critical judge for their equal, although ignorant of their conventional etiquette--an
ignorance which she would have acknowledged in a simple child-like way, being unconscious of
any false shame.

This is an atom: 
Her whole heart was in her boy. She often feared that she loved him too much--more than God
Himself--yet she could not bear to pray to have her love for her child lessened. But she would
kneel down by his little bed at night--at the deep, still midnight--with the stars that kept
watch over Rizpah shining down upon her, and tell God what I have now told you, that she feared
she loved her child too much, yet could not, would not, love him less; and speak to Him of
her one treasure as she could speak to no earthly friend. And so, unconsciously, her love for
her child led her up to love to God, to the All-knowing, who read her heart.

This is an atom: 
It might be superstition--I dare say it was--but, somehow, she never lay down to rest without
saying, as she looked her last on her boy, "Thy will, not mine, be done;" and even while she
trembled and shrank with infinite dread from sounding the depths of what that will might be,
she felt as if her treasure were more secure to waken up rosy and bright in the morning, as
one over whose slumbers God's holy angels had watched, for the very words which she had turned
away in sick terror from realising the night before.

This is an atom: 
Her daily absence at her duties to the Bradshaw children only ministered to her love for Leonard.
Everything does minister to love when its foundation lies deep in a true heart, and it was
with an exquisite pang of delight that, after a moment of vague fear,

This is an atom: 
(Oh, mercy! to myself I said,
   If Lucy should be dead!),

This is an atom: 
she saw her child's bright face of welcome as he threw open the door every afternoon on her
return home. For it was his silently-appointed work to listen for her knock, and rush breathless
to let her in. If he were in the garden, or upstairs among the treasures of the lumber-room,
either Miss Benson, or her brother, or Sally, would fetch him to his happy little task; no
one so sacred as he to the allotted duty. And the joyous meeting was not deadened by custom,
to either mother or child.

This is an atom: 
Ruth gave the Bradshaws the highest satisfaction, as Mr Bradshaw often said both to her and
to the Bensons; indeed, she rather winced under his pompous approbation. But his favourite
recreation was patronising; and when Ruth saw how quietly and meekly Mr Benson submitted to
gifts and praise, when an honest word of affection, or a tacit, implied acknowledgment of equality,
would have been worth everything said and done, she tried to be more meek in spirit, and to
recognise the good that undoubtedly existed in Mr Bradshaw. He was richer and more prosperous
than ever;--a keen, far-seeing man of business, with an undisguised contempt for all who failed
in the success which he had achieved. But it was not alone those who were less fortunate in
obtaining wealth than himself that he visited with severity of judgment; every moral error
or delinquency came under his unsparing comment. Stained by no vice himself, either in his
own eyes or in that of any human being who cared to judge him, having nicely and wisely proportioned
and adapted his means to his ends, he could afford to speak and act with a severity which was
almost sanctimonious in its ostentation of thankfulness as to himself. Not a misfortune or
a sin was brought to light but Mr Bradshaw could trace it to its cause in some former mode
of action, which he had long ago foretold would lead to shame. If another's son turned out
wild or bad, Mr Bradshaw had little sympathy; it might have been prevented by a stricter rule,
or more religious life at home; young Richard Bradshaw was quiet and steady, and other fathers
might have had sons like him if they had taken the same pains to enforce obedience. Richard
was an only son, and yet Mr Bradshaw might venture to say, he had never had his own way in
his life. Mrs Bradshaw was, he confessed (Mr Bradshaw did not dislike confessing his wife's
errors), rather less firm than he should have liked with the girls; and with some people, he
believed, Jemima was rather headstrong; but to his wishes she had always shown herself obedient.
All children were obedient, if their parents were decided and authoritative; and every one
would turn out well, if properly managed. If they did not prove good, they must take the consequences
of their errors.

This is an atom: 
Mrs Bradshaw murmured faintly at her husband when his back was turned; but if his voice was
heard, or his footsteps sounded in the distance, she was mute, and hurried her children into
the attitude or action most pleasing to their father. Jemima, it is true, rebelled against
this manner of proceeding, which savoured to her a little of deceit; but even she had not,
as yet, overcome her awe of her father sufficiently to act independently of him, and according
to her own sense of right--or rather, I should say, according to her own warm, passionate impulses.
Before him the wilfulness which made her dark eyes blaze out at times was hushed and still;
he had no idea of her self-tormenting, no notion of the almost southern jealousy which seemed
to belong to her brunette complexion. Jemima was not pretty; the flatness and shortness of
her face made her almost plain; yet most people looked twice at her expressive countenance,
at the eyes which flamed or melted at every trifle, at the rich colour which came at every
expressed emotion into her usually sallow face, at the faultless teeth which made her smile
like a sunbeam. But then, again, when she thought she was not kindly treated, when a suspicion
crossed her mind, or when she was angry with herself, her lips were tight-pressed together,
her colour was wan and almost livid, and a stormy gloom clouded her eyes as with a film. But
before her father her words were few, and he did not notice looks or tones.

This is an atom: 
Her brother Richard had been equally silent before his father in boyhood and early youth; but
since he had gone to be clerk in a London house, preparatory to assuming his place as junior
partner in Mr Bradshaw's business, he spoke more on his occasional visits at home. And very
proper and highly moral was his conversation; set sentences of goodness, which were like the
flowers that children stick in the ground, and that have not sprung upwards from roots--deep
down in the hidden life and experience of the heart. He was as severe a judge as his father
of other people's conduct, but you felt that Mr Bradshaw was sincere in his condemnation of
all outward error and vice, and that he would try himself by the same laws as he tried others;
somehow, Richard's words were frequently heard with a lurking distrust, and many shook their
heads over the pattern son; but then it was those whose sons had gone astray, and been condemned,
in no private or tender manner, by Mr Bradshaw, so it might be revenge in them. Still, Jemima
felt that all was not right; her heart sympathised in the rebellion against his father's commands,
which her brother had confessed to her in an unusual moment of confidence, but her uneasy conscience
condemned the deceit which he had practised.

This is an atom: 
The brother and sister were sitting alone over a blazing Christmas fire, and Jemima held an
old newspaper in her hand to shield her face from the hot light. They were talking of family
events, when, during a pause, Jemima's eye caught the name of a great actor, who had lately
given prominence and life to a character in one of Shakspeare's plays. The criticism in the
paper was fine, and warmed Jemima's heart.

This is an atom: 
"How I should like to see a play!" exclaimed she.

This is an atom: 
"Should you?" said her brother, listlessly.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, to be sure! Just hear this!" and she began to read a fine passage of criticism.

This is an atom: 
"Those newspaper people can make an article out of anything," said he, yawning. "I've seen
the man myself, and it was all very well, but nothing to make such a fuss about."

This is an atom: 
"You! you seen ----! Have you seen a play, Richard? Oh, why did you never tell me before? Tell
me all about it! Why did you never name seeing ---- in your letters?"

This is an atom: 
He half smiled, contemptuously enough. "Oh! at first it strikes one rather, but after a while
one cares no more for the theatre than one does for mince-pies."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, I wish I might go to London!" said Jemima, impatiently. "I've a great mind to ask papa
to let me go to the George Smiths', and then I could see ----. I would not think him like mince-pies."

This is an atom: 
"You must not do any such thing!" said Richard, now neither yawning nor contemptuous. "My father
would never allow you to go to the theatre; and the George Smiths are such old fogeys--they
would be sure to tell."

This is an atom: 
"How do you go, then? Does my father give you leave?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh! many things are right for men which are not for girls."

This is an atom: 
Jemima sat and pondered. Richard wished he had not been so confidential.

This is an atom: 
"You need not name it," said he, rather anxiously.

This is an atom: 
"Name what?" said she, startled, for her thoughts had gone far afield.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, name my going once or twice to the theatre!"

This is an atom: 
"No, I shan't name it!" said she. "No one here would care to hear it."

This is an atom: 
But it was with some little surprise, and almost with a feeling of disgust, that she heard
Richard join with her father in condemning some one, and add to Mr Bradshaw's list of offences,
by alleging that the young man was a playgoer. He did not think his sister heard his words.

This is an atom: 
Mary and Elizabeth were the two girls whom Ruth had in charge; they resembled Jemima more than
their brother in character. The household rules were occasionally a little relaxed in their
favour, for Mary, the elder, was nearly eight years younger than Jemima, and three intermediate
children had died. They loved Ruth dearly, made a great pet of Leonard, and had many profound
secrets together, most of which related to their wonders if Jemima and Mr Farquhar would ever
be married. They watched their sister closely; and every day had some fresh confidence to make
to each other, confirming or discouraging to their hopes.

This is an atom: 
Ruth rose early, and shared the household work with Sally and Miss Benson till seven; and then
she helped Leonard to dress, and had a quiet time alone with him till prayers and breakfast.
At nine she was to be at Mr Bradshaw's house. She sat in the room with Mary and Elizabeth during
the Latin, the writing, and arithmetic lessons, which they received from masters; then she
read, and walked with them, they clinging to her as to an elder sister; she dined with her
pupils at the family lunch, and reached home by four. That happy home--those quiet days!

This is an atom: 
And so the peaceful days passed on into weeks, and months, and years, and Ruth and Leonard
grew and strengthened into the riper beauty of their respective ages; while as yet no touch
of decay had come on the quaint, primitive elders of the household.

CHAPTER XX

This is an atom: 
Jemima Refuses to Be Managed

This is an atom: 
It was no wonder that the lookers-on were perplexed as to the state of affairs between Jemima
and Mr Farquhar, for they too were sorely puzzled themselves at the sort of relationship between
them. Was it love, or was it not? that was the question in Mr Farquhar's mind. He hoped it
was not; he believed it was not; and yet he felt as if it were. There was something preposterous,
he thought, in a man nearly forty years of age being in love with a girl of twenty. He had
gone on reasoning through all the days of his manhood on the idea of a staid, noble-minded
wife, grave and sedate, the fit companion in experience of her husband. He had spoken with
admiration of reticent characters, full of self-control and dignity; and he hoped--he trusted,
that all this time he had not been allowing himself unconsciously to fall in love with a wild-hearted,
impetuous girl, who knew nothing of life beyond her father's house, and who chafed under the
strict discipline enforced there. For it was rather a suspicious symptom of the state of Mr
Farquhar's affections, that he had discovered the silent rebellion which continued in Jemima's
heart, unperceived by any of her own family, against the severe laws and opinions of her father.
Mr Farquhar shared in these opinions; but in him they were modified, and took a milder form.
Still, he approved of much that Mr Bradshaw did and said; and this made it all the more strange
that he should wince so for Jemima, whenever anything took place which he instinctively knew
that she would dislike. After an evening at Mr Bradshaw's, when Jemima had gone to the very
verge of questioning or disputing some of her father's severe judgments, Mr Farquhar went home
in a dissatisfied, restless state of mind, which he was almost afraid to analyse. He admired
the inflexible integrity--and almost the pomp of principle--evinced by Mr Bradshaw on every
occasion; he wondered how it was that Jemima could not see how grand a life might be, whose
every action was shaped in obedience to some eternal law; instead of which, he was afraid she
rebelled against every law, and was only guided by impulse. Mr Farquhar had been taught to
dread impulses as promptings of the devil. Sometimes, if he tried to present her father's opinions
before her in another form, so as to bring himself and her rather more into that state of agreement
he longed for, she flashed out upon him with the indignation of difference that she dared not
show to, or before, her father, as if she had some diviner instinct which taught her more truly
than they knew, with all their experience; at least, in her first expressions there seemed
something good and fine; but opposition made her angry and irritable, and the arguments which
he was constantly provoking (whenever he was with her in her father's absence) frequently ended
in some vehemence of expression on her part that offended Mr Farquhar, who did not see how
she expiated her anger in tears and self-reproaches when alone in her chamber. Then he would
lecture himself severely on the interest he could not help feeling in a wilful girl; he would
determine not to interfere with her opinions in future, and yet, the very next time they differed,
he strove to argue her into harmony with himself, in spite of all resolutions to the contrary.

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw saw just enough of this interest which Jemima had excited in his partner's mind,
to determine him in considering their future marriage as a settled affair. The fitness of the
thing had long ago struck him; her father's partner--so the fortune he meant to give her might
continue in the business; a man of such steadiness of character, and such a capital eye for
a desirable speculation as Mr Farquhar--just the right age to unite the paternal with the conjugal
affection, and consequently the very man for Jemima, who had something unruly in her, which
might break out under a _rÃ©gime_ less wisely adjusted to the circumstances than was Mr Bradshaw's
(in his own opinion)--a house ready-furnished, at a convenient distance from her home--no near
relations on Mr Farquhar's side, who might be inclined to consider his residence as their own
for an indefinite time, and so add to the household expenses--in short, what could be more
suitable in every way? Mr Bradshaw respected the very self-restraint he thought he saw in Mr
Farquhar's demeanour, attributing it to a wise desire to wait until trade should be rather
more slack, and the man of business more at leisure to become the lover.

This is an atom: 
As for Jemima, at times she thought she almost hated Mr Farquhar.

This is an atom: 
"What business has he," she would think, "to lecture me? Often I can hardly bear it from papa,
and I will not bear it from him. He treats me just like a child, and as if I should lose all
my present opinions when I know more of the world. I am sure I should like never to know the
world, if it was to make me think as he does, hard man that he is! I wonder what made him take
Jem Brown on as gardener again, if he does not believe that above one criminal in a thousand
is restored to goodness. I'll ask him, some day, if that was not acting on impulse rather than
principle. Poor impulse! how you do get abused. But I will tell Mr Farquhar I will not let
him interfere with me. If I do what papa bids me, no one has a right to notice whether I do
it willingly or not."

This is an atom: 
So then she tried to defy Mr Farquhar, by doing and saying things that she knew he would disapprove.
She went so far that he was seriously grieved, and did not even remonstrate and "lecture,"
and then she was disappointed and irritated; for, somehow, with all her indignation at interference,
she liked to be lectured by him; not that she was aware of this liking of hers, but still it
would have been more pleasant to be scolded than so quietly passed over. Her two little sisters,
with their wide-awake eyes, had long ago put things together, and conjectured. Every day they
had some fresh mystery together, to be imparted in garden walks and whispered talks.

This is an atom: 
"Lizzie, did you see how the tears came into Mimie's eyes when Mr Farquhar looked so displeased
when she said good people were always dull? I think she's in love." Mary said the last words
with grave emphasis, and felt like an oracle of twelve years of age.

This is an atom: 
"I don't," said Lizzie. "I know I cry often enough when papa is cross, and I'm not in love
with him."

This is an atom: 
"Yes! but you don't look as Mimie did."

This is an atom: 
"Don't call her Mimie--you know papa does not like it."

This is an atom: 
"Yes; but there are so many things papa does not like I can never remember them all. Never
mind about that; but listen to something I've got to tell you, if you'll never, never tell."

This is an atom: 
"No, indeed I won't, Mary. What is it?"

This is an atom: 
"Not to Mrs Denbigh?"

This is an atom: 
"No, not even to Mrs Denbigh."

This is an atom: 
"Well, then, the other day--last Friday, Mimie--"

This is an atom: 
"Jemima!" interrupted the more conscientious Elizabeth.

This is an atom: 
"Jemima, if it must be so," jerked out Mary, "sent me to her desk for an envelope, and what
do you think I saw?"

This is an atom: 
"What?" asked Elizabeth, expecting nothing less than a red-hot Valentine, signed Walter Farquhar,
_pro_ Bradshaw, Farquhar, and Co., in full.

This is an atom: 
"Why, a piece of paper, with dull-looking lines upon it, just like the scientific dialogues;
and I remembered all about it. It was once when Mr Farquhar had been telling us that a bullet
does not go in a straight line, but in a something curve, and he drew some lines on a piece
of paper; and Mimie--"

This is an atom: 
"Jemima," put in Elizabeth.

This is an atom: 
"Well, well! she had treasured it up, and written in a corner, 'W. F., April 3rd.' Now, that's
rather like love, is not it? For Jemima hates useful information just as much as I do, and
that's saying a great deal; and yet she had kept this paper, and dated it."

This is an atom: 
"If that's all, I know Dick keeps a paper with Miss Benson's name written on it, and yet he's
not in love with her; and perhaps Jemima may like Mr Farquhar, and he may not like her. It
seems such a little while since her hair was turned up, and he has always been a grave middle-aged
man ever since I can recollect; and then, have you never noticed how often he finds fault with
her--almost lectures her?"

This is an atom: 
"To be sure," said Mary; "but he may be in love, for all that. Just think how often papa lectures
mamma; and yet, of course, they're in love with each other."

This is an atom: 
"Well! we shall see," said Elizabeth.

This is an atom: 
Poor Jemima little thought of the four sharp eyes that watched her daily course while she sat
alone, as she fancied, with her secret in her own room. For, in a passionate fit of grieving,
at the impatient, hasty temper which had made her so seriously displease Mr Farquhar that he
had gone away without remonstrance, without more leave-taking than a distant bow, she had begun
to suspect that rather than not be noticed at all by him, rather than be an object of indifference
to him--oh! far rather would she be an object of anger and upbraiding; and the thoughts that
followed this confession to herself, stunned and bewildered her; and for once that they made
her dizzy with hope, ten times they made her sick with fear. For an instant she planned to
become and to be all he could wish her; to change her very nature for him. And then a great
gush of pride came over her, and she set her teeth tight together, and determined that he should
either love her as she was, or not at all. Unless he could take her with all her faults, she
would not care for his regard; "love" was too noble a word to call such cold, calculating feeling
as his must be, who went about with a pattern idea in his mind, trying to find a wife to match.
Besides, there was something degrading, Jemima thought, in trying to alter herself to gain
the love of any human creature. And yet, if he did not care for her, if this late indifference
were to last, what a great shroud was drawn over life! Could she bear it?

This is an atom: 
From the agony she dared not look at, but which she was going to risk encountering, she was
aroused by the presence of her mother.

This is an atom: 
"Jemima! your father wants to speak to you in the dining-room."

This is an atom: 
"What for?" asked the girl.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! he is fidgeted by something Mr Farquhar said to me, and which I repeated. I am sure I
thought there was no harm in it, and your father always likes me to tell him what everybody
says in his absence."

This is an atom: 
Jemima went with a heavy heart into her father's presence.

This is an atom: 
He was walking up and down the room, and did not see her at first.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Jemima! is that you? Has your mother told you what I want to speak to you about?"

This is an atom: 
"No!" said Jemima. "Not exactly."

This is an atom: 
"She has been telling me what proves to me how very seriously you must have displeased and
offended Mr Farquhar, before he could have expressed himself to her as he did, when he left
the house. You know what he said?"

This is an atom: 
"No!" said Jemima, her heart swelling within her. "He has no right to say anything about me."
She was desperate, or she durst not have said this before her father.

This is an atom: 
"No right!--what do you mean, Jemima?" said Mr Bradshaw, turning sharp round. "Surely you must
know that I hope he may one day be your husband; that is to say, if you prove yourself worthy
of the excellent training I have given you. I cannot suppose Mr Farquhar would take any undisciplined
girl as a wife."

This is an atom: 
Jemima held tight by a chair near which she was standing. She did not speak; her father was
pleased by her silence--it was the way in which he liked his projects to be received.

This is an atom: 
"But you cannot suppose," he continued, "that Mr Farquhar will consent to marry you--"

This is an atom: 
"Consent to marry me!" repeated Jemima, in a low tone of brooding indignation; were those the
terms upon which her rich woman's heart was to be given, with a calm consent of acquiescent
acceptance, but a little above resignation on the part of the receiver?

This is an atom: 
--"if you give way to a temper which, although you have never dared to show it to me, I am
well aware exists, although I hoped the habits of self-examination I had instilled had done
much to cure you of manifesting it. At one time, Richard promised to be the more headstrong
of the two; now, I must desire you to take pattern by him. Yes," he continued, falling into
his old train of thought, "it would be a most fortunate connexion for you in every way. I should
have you under my own eye, and could still assist you in the formation of your character, and
I should be at hand to strengthen and confirm your principles. Mr Farquhar's connexion with
the firm would be convenient and agreeable to me in a pecuniary point of view. He--" Mr Bradshaw
was going on in his enumeration of the advantages which he in particular, and Jemima in the
second place, would derive from this marriage, when his daughter spoke, at first so low that
he could not hear her, as he walked up and down the room with his creaking boots, and he had
to stop to listen.

This is an atom: 
"Has Mr Farquhar ever spoken to you about it?" Why are our lawmakers at the capital devoting
so much time and attention to them? Can you tell?

This is an atom: 
Some of these things you can easily ascertain for yourselves. Others we will speak of here.

This is an atom: 
The new territory which has lately come into the possession of the United States, consists of the
islands of Puerto Rico, Hawaii and the Philippines. Cuba is not included in this list; it
is soon to be an independent country.

This is an atom: 
Since Puerto Rico and these other islands have come to be parts of the United States, everyone
is anxious to learn something more of them.

This is an atom: 
The best way to learn the geography of a country and the customs of the people is to visit
the country and see with your own eyes.

This is an atom: 
That would be a difficult thing for most of us. The next best way is to make the journey in
imagination, and that all of us can do.

This is an atom: 
The island nearest us is Puerto Rico, the most eastern island of the Greater Antilles. Let us
visit that first and the other islands later on.

This is an atom: 
We must find out something of the climate, however, before we start on this journey. This may
not be the right season of the year to go.

This is an atom: 
We must know, too, what kind of clothing to take with us.

This is an atom: 
In order to plan our route wisely, we must know something of the geography of the island. We
should also know the past history of Puerto Rico, in order to
understand the customs of the people and the conditions that exist
there

This is an atom:

LOCATION, SIZE, SURFACE.

This is an atom: 
If you will find a map of the West Indies in your atlas or geography,
you will also find Puerto Rico.

This is an atom: 
It is one of the four Greater Antilles Islands, and lies east of Haiti and farthest out in the
Atlantic Ocean.

This is an atom: 
It is over four hundred miles from the east coast of Cuba, one thousand miles from Havana,
and about one thousand four hundred and fifty miles from New York.

This is an atom: 
In size it is the smallest of the group. Its area is about three thousand five hundred and
fifty square miles. Its average length is about ninety-five miles; its average breadth about
thirty-five miles.

This is an atom: 
In shape it resembles the State of Connecticut, though it is only three-fourths the size of that
State.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: THE ISLAND OF PUERTO RICO.]

This is an atom: 
Puerto Rico, in English, means Rich Harbor. But Puerto Rico is not rich in harbors. There are
not more than six good harbors, but it has less than three hundred
and fifty miles of coast line.

This is an atom: 
The surface of Puerto Rico is mountainous. A range of hills traverses the island from east to west.
The hills are low and their sides are covered with vegetation. The hills are not rocky and
barren, but are cultivated to their very tops.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: AN AFTERNOON SIESTA.]
The lower valleys are rich pasture lands or cultivated plantations. The knolls have orchards of
cocoanuts and other trees. Coffee, protected by the shade of other trees, grows to the summits
of the green hills. The ground is covered everywhere with a thick carpeting of grass.

This is an atom: 
The soil is remarkably fertile. This is due partly to the fine climate, partly to abundant
moisture. The island has many fast flowing rivers. There are over twelve hundred of these.
In the mountains are numerous springs and water falls, but these are hidden by the overhanging giant
ferns and plants.

This is an atom: 
* * * * *
BRIEF HISTORY OF PUERTO RICO.

This is an atom: 
Puerto Rico was discovered by Christopher Columbus November 17, 1493. He made a landing at a
bay, where he found springs of pure water, which was much needed on his ships. This place
he named Aguadilla, which means "the watering place."

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: PONCE DE LEON.]
In 1508 Ponce de Leon, a Spanish navigator, visited the island, and was much pleased with its
beautiful scenery and with the hospitality of the natives. A year or two later he returned,
and founded the town of Caparra. In 1509 he founded the city of San Juan on the island that
guards the entrance on the east.

This is an atom: 
When Ponce de Leon came to the island, he found it inhabited by a happy, harmless people who received
him with delight. They brought gifts to him, and showed him and his soldiers gold, which was
found in the river beds.

This is an atom: 
The kindness of the natives was rewarded by cruelty on the part of the Spaniards. They were
ruthlessly murdered or reduced to slavery, and compelled to work in the mines. A revolution
followed in which the greater number of the natives were killed.

This is an atom: 
The severe work required of those remaining so shortened their lives that very soon all had
disappeared. Not a descendant of this race is now living, but many curious and interesting
relics, left by them, may be found.

This is an atom: 
One of these is a stone collar, shaped like a horse collar, and skillfully carved. This was
placed upon the breast of the native after his death, and was supposed to keep him from
harm.

This is an atom: 
Ponce de Leon built for himself a castle on the point of land above
the mouth of the harbor of San Juan, and here he lived until he
sailed on the voyage which resulted in the discovery of Florida.

This is an atom: 
After his departure, Puerto Rico was left alone for a long time. After some years, Spain
sent peasants to colonize the island, and slaves were introduced
to cultivate the plantations.

This is an atom: 
In 1870 the island was made a province of Spain, instead of a colony. In 1873 slavery was
abolished.

This is an atom: 
Puerto Rico came into the possession of the United States as the
result of the recent war with Spain.

This is an atom: 
It was ceded to the United States Sept. 6, 1898.

This is an atom: 
Gen. George R. Davis is now Military Governor of the island.

This is an atom: 
The form of government for Puerto Rico has not yet been decided upon.

This is an atom: 
It is one of the problems that Congress is now working out.

CLIMATE--PERPETUAL JUNE.

This is an atom: 
Puerto Rico is a very beautiful island. Its climate and scenery attract many visitors, and
erelong it will be a popular winter resort for people from many countries.

This is an atom: 
It has been called the land of perpetual June. Flowers bloom and plants and trees yield fruit
the year round. There is no winter; but during the season which
is our winter, their skies are beautifully clear and blue.

This is an atom: 
The air is neither dry nor moist, but perfect.

This is an atom: 
The nights are always cool, and the trade winds keep the hottest days from being unpleasant. The average
temperature is only 80Â°. It is the coolest and the healthiest place
in the West Indies.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: GATHERING COFFEE IN PUERTO RICO.]
There are two seasons, the rainy and the dry.

This is an atom: 
The rainy season lasts from July to December; the dry, from January to June. From November to
June the climate is more than usually delightful and healthful.

This is an atom: 
In the summer months it is somewhat warm, and the heat and dampness are oppressive in August
and September.

This is an atom: 
In September and October the rain comes in torrents, but it rains in the mountains almost
every day in the year.

This is an atom: 
The daily showers of the rainy season usually come late in the
afternoon, but the sky clears up with the setting sun.

This is an atom: 
The people pay little attention to drainage or to securing a supply of good water. As a result, fevers
are common during the summer months among the people who live in crowded quarters in the city
or in the marshes.

This is an atom: 
Hurricanes occasionally occur between the months of July and October.

This is an atom: 
These are sometimes accompanied by earthquake shocks.

This is an atom: 
People may be injured or killed and their homes destroyed during these violent storms. Puerto
Rico, however, is freer from them than other islands of the West Indies.

This is an atom: 
A HURRICANE.

This is an atom: 
It is easy to tell when a hurricane is approaching. The wind dies away and a deathly stillness
falls over everything. Not a breath of air moves. The leaves droop on the trees and the heat
almost smothers one.

This is an atom: 
The sky becomes copper-colored, and tints everything with a ghastly
hue.

This is an atom: 
The cattle and other animals seem to know that danger is near, and rush about in a terrified
way.

This is an atom: 
Far out in the ocean the water is calm and smooth; but near the shore the waves rush furiously
upon the beach with a mighty roar.

This is an atom: 
By and by the wind begins to rise, just a little; first from one direction, and then from
another.
This is a sign that the storm is near at hand.

This is an atom: 
Very soon a fearful roar is heard, and all at once the hurricane descends upon the island.

This is an atom: 
The work of destruction begins. Trees are uprooted, growing crops are laid waste, and houses are
torn down and scattered in every direction. Sometimes whole villages are destroyed and many
people killed or wounded.

This is an atom: 
When the barometer tells of the approach of a storm, the people prepare for it. They hunt some
hole, cave, or cellar into which to crawl. They take with them, when there is time to do so, a
supply of cane juice and food, to last until the storm subsides.

This is an atom: 
"The people guard as much as possible from the hurricanes by building their houses of stone
with massive walls. They provide strong bars for doors and windows. When the barometer gives
notice of the approach of a storm, these bars are brought out, and everything is at once made
fast.

This is an atom: 
"Doors and window-shutters are closed, barred, and double locked, and the town looks as if
it were deserted by all human beings. The state of suspense, while the hurricane lasts, is
dreadful, for no one knows when the house may fall and bury all beneath its ruins.

This is an atom: 
"Add to this the howling of the blasts, the crash of falling trees, the piercing cries for help
from the wounded and dying, and one may faintly picture the terrible scene. To venture out
is almost certain death, the air is so filled with flying missiles, such as boards, bricks,
tiles, stones, and branches of trees."
It is indeed fortunate that the people of Puerto Rico are largely free from these desolating storms.
Some idea of their power for destruction may be gathered from the pictures in our papers of
Galveston, Texas, after the recent hurricane there.

This is an atom: 
PREPARATIONS FOR THE TRIP.

This is an atom: 
The best time for us to visit Puerto Rico, then, is after the
hurricane season, in the winter.

This is an atom: 
January, February, and March are the favorite months of travelers.

This is an atom: 
But if we wish to celebrate the four hundred and seventh anniversary of the discovery of the
island, we must go in November. It was the 17th day of this month that Columbus first visited
Puerto Rico.

This is an atom: 
We will need to take our thinnest clothing for use on the island, but we should have light
wraps for the cool evenings.

This is an atom: 
We should also go well provided with umbrellas, rubber overshoes, and rain coats, if we do not
wish to spend many afternoons indoors.

This is an atom: 
Now the best way to reach Puerto Rico is not, as many people think, from Cuba. San Juan, the
capital, is nearly as far from Havana as from New York.

This is an atom: 
We will take the steamer from New York that goes directly to San
Juan.

This is an atom: 
If the weather is good, we may expect to make the voyage in four days.

This is an atom: 
* * * * *
THE VOYAGE.

This is an atom: 
What a busy crowd it is through which we pass to the New York wharf!

This is an atom: 
Dozens of large ships and hundreds of small vessels and sailboats crowd the harbor.

This is an atom: 
There is a large steamer just going out.

This is an atom: 
It is loaded with hardware, kerosene, pine lumber, and codfish, and is probably bound for South
America.

This is an atom: 
Crowds of people are going on deck with departing friends. Many of the friends have brought
or sent flowers and steamer-letters, to be enjoyed by the travelers,
during the voyage.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: OUR OCEAN STEAMER.]
Now the bell sounds a warning to our visitors to say good-by. They leave the boat, and soon
we are off. As we leave the harbor we listen to the band playing "America" and the "Star Spangled
Banner," and take the last glimpse of our native land which we
shall have for a month.

This is an atom: 
It is not far from the dinner hour, so we now visit the dining-room for the purpose of securing
our place at the table from the head steward.

This is an atom: 
We next secure a steamer chair, and have the deck steward place it
in a comfortable, sheltered place on deck.

This is an atom: 
It is well, before long, to visit our staterooms, and put our clothes and other belongings in
order for the trip.

This is an atom: 
By the time this is done dinner is announced. Somehow we do not feel very hungry. The vessel
rolls about so that we begin to feel dizzy.

This is an atom: 
We think we would rather go to bed, and we try to do so, but find it rather difficult.

This is an atom: 
The stewardess comes in just then, and asks if she may help us. With her assistance we climb
into our berths. Rock, rock, rock!

This is an atom: 
If the boat would only be quiet one moment! We are very seasick by this time, and feel as
if we never wish to eat another meal. The motion of the boat lulls us to sleep by and by, and the
next thing we know it is morning.

This is an atom: 
The air in our stateroom seems close and "stuffy," so we gladly leave it and go on deck,
where we remain for the rest of the day. The steward serves our meals to us here, and we spend
the time in our steamer chairs, watching the white-capped waves, the sea gulls over us, and
the porpoises following the boat for food.

This is an atom: 
After the first day out we sail into smoother seas and warmer
weather.

This is an atom: 
We throw aside our wraps and put on lighter clothing. We also don broad shade-hats to protect
our eyes from the glare of the light upon the water.

This is an atom: 
A favorable wind bears us southward to the tropical sea, which many people consider among the
most beautiful things in the world.
The water of the Bahama sea is wonderful because of its clearness
and its deep purple color.
A cloud shadow changes the purple into emerald.
Looking down into the clear depths, we see the dolphins as distinctly
as the birds overhead.
Shoals of flying fish dart out of the water, their fins serving as
sails for an instant; then they drop back again.
Many other new and interesting objects and scenes add to the pleasure
of our voyage from the great northern metropolis to the capital of
the island in the southern seas. These we can not tell about now.
* * * * * 
SAN JUAN.
While we are learning of the plant and animal life about and beneath
us, the good ship bears us swiftly on, and all too soon we are at
our journey's end.
We seem hardly to have left the shadow of Liberty's towering torch
in New York harbor, before the gray walls of Morro Castle appear
above the horizon. Far out at sea, this massive stone fort with its
beacon light attracts our attention.
Across the harbor entrance the white-capped waves rush furiously
over each other in a mad race toward the shore. Passing through
this narrow channel, the ship glides into the harbor under the guns
of the two picturesque old forts which guard it, and we get our
first glimpse of San Juan.
[Illustration: STATUE OF LIBERTY--NEW YORK HARBOR.]
Our first view of this beautiful old city fills us with anticipations
of pleasure. We find that the ground upon which the city lies slopes
upward from the calm, broad harbor to the forts that guard its
heights.
Here and there a tall palm-tree rears its graceful head above the
tops of the gayly colored buildings that glisten in the sunlight.
Our guide tells us that San Juan is one of the most perfectly
fortified cities in the world.
It is easy to believe this when, from the ocean and from the bay,
we see the massive walls and battlements of the forts that guard
the north and east.
We learn that they are cut from the solid rock which crowns the
crest of the narrow peninsula.
The steep walls of the vast castle of San Cristobal overshadow the
whole city.
The city is built on an island, connected with the mainland by a
bridge.
It is surrounded by a high, thick stone wall: that is, it was once
upon a time; but the city is now extended far beyond the walls.
Inside is the city proper, or old San Juan. Outside are the more
modern buildings and the suburbs.
San Juan is not only the seat of government, but it is considered
the first city of Puerto Rico in interest and in importance. Ponce,
however, disputes this claim. It has the best harbor, and the best
public buildings, churches and schools on the island.
The palace of the governor-general and the headquarters of the
American administration we find located in San Juan.
Over thirty thousand people make their homes in this city, and a
goodly number of them we find at the shore to meet our vessel. They
do not wait for us to land. They come out to meet us.
Dusky natives in landing boats are soon alongside, and we learn to
our surprise that our ship does not go to the dock. We are to go
ashore in these small awning-covered boats. This is a new experience
for us, but it is an old Spanish custom.
[Illustration: LANDING FROM OUR STEAMER AT SAN JUAN.]
The steward of the ship tells us that we may retain our rooms and
use the ship as a hotel during the stay in port, going ashore for
sight-seeing when we like.
We have heard that the hotels in San Juan are very poor; but of
course we wish to see for ourselves what they are like, and so we
decide to give them a trial.
We are in no hurry to seek the hotels, however. The streets of San
Juan present so many novel sights to our wandering eyes that we
wish to look about first.

This is an atom: 
STREET SCENES.
We have been told that we could walk all over the town in an hour,
and we resolve to try it.
[Illustration: A STREET IN SAN JUAN.]
The streets are narrow and dark, but well paved and clean. They
ought to be clean, for they are swept by hand every day. The sidewalks
are so narrow that only two of us can walk abreast, so we take to
the road. This is used as a highway for people as well as
vehicles.
Naked little children of all ages and colors play about the streets
and on the sidewalks. Colored men and women, smoking black cigars,
saunter idly about. Street venders carrying their stores upon their
heads or backs, or in large panniers upon tiny ponies, fill the air
with cries announcing their wares.
Judging from the number of the venders of drinks we see on the
streets, every one in San Juan is thirsty. We are, at any rate, and
very delicious we find their ices and sherbets, their iced orange,
lemon and strawberry waters, iced cherries, milk, coffee and
chocolate.
[Illustration: DULCE (SWEETMEAT) SELLERS IN PUERTO RICO.]
Fruit sellers under the arcades and in stalls tempt us with their
attractive wares; but the fruits are new and strange to us, and we
hesitate about buying.
The hack drivers are asleep on closed carriages at the hack stand.
Long lines of clumsy carts, with high wheels, rumble over the
cobblestone pavements with a dreadful clatter.
In the open doorways of shops we see men and women manufacturing
articles for sale. Some are making chairs, some shoes, some jewelry,
some boxes, and, in one place, we see a number of workmen making
coffins.
We are interested in observing that flags of different colors are
used as signs, and that the walls are painted with brilliant pictures.
In the quarter near the sea, the brandy stores, built of reeds,
have round them swarms of beggars of every degree.
The laundry shop we find just outside the city, beside a large
creek. A laundry not built by hands! Here women stand knee-deep in
the stream, with the hot sun beating down upon their heads.
They are doing their laundry work. The clothes are cleaned by soaking
them in water and pounding them with stones. We wonder if there are
any buttons left on the clothes after this treatment, and resolve
not to trust our clothes to this laundry.
We note outside the city wall a broad concrete walk; along this
walk seats, trees, and rude statues; and between the walk and the
wall an ornamental garden.
Having now taken a general stroll, we will rest up preparatory to
our visit to the points of special interest.
POINTS OF INTEREST IN SAN JUAN.
We are now ready to visit the places of unusual interest about the
capital city.When he was there, a sort of constant terror of displeasing
him made her voice sharp and nervous; the children knew that many a thing passed over by their
mother when their father was away, was sure to be noticed by her when he was present; and noticed,
too, in a cross and querulous manner, for she was so much afraid of the blame which on any
occasion of their misbehaviour fell upon her. And yet she looked up to her husband with a reverence
and regard, and a faithfulness of love, which his decision of character was likely to produce
on a weak and anxious mind. He was a rest and a support to her, on whom she cast all her responsibilities;
she was an obedient, unremonstrating wife to him; no stronger affection had ever brought her
duty to him into conflict with any desire of her heart. She loved her children dearly, though
they all perplexed her very frequently. Her son was her especial darling, because he very seldom
brought her into any scrapes with his father; he was so cautious and prudent, and had the art
of "keeping a calm sough" about any difficulty he might be in. With all her dutiful sense of
the obligation, which her husband enforced upon her, to notice and tell him everything that
was going wrong in the household, and especially among his children, Mrs Bradshaw, somehow,
contrived to be honestly blind to a good deal that was not praiseworthy in Master Richard.

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw came in before long, bringing with him Mr Farquhar. Jemima had been talking to
Ruth with some interest before then; but, on seeing Mr Farquhar, she bent her head down over
her work, went a little paler, and turned obstinately silent. Mr Bradshaw longed to command
her to speak; but even he had a suspicion that what she might say, when so commanded, might
be rather worse in its effect than her gloomy silence; so he held his peace, and a discontented,
angry kind of peace it was. Mrs Bradshaw saw that something was wrong, but could not tell what;
only she became every moment more trembling, and nervous, and irritable, and sent Mary and
Elizabeth off on all sorts of contradictory errands to the servants, and made the tea twice
as strong, and sweetened it twice as much as usual, in hopes of pacifying her husband with
good things.

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar had gone for the last time, or so he thought. He had resolved (for the fifth time)
that he would go and watch Jemima once more, and if her temper got the better of her, and she
showed the old sullenness again, and gave the old proofs of indifference to his good opinion,
he would give her up altogether, and seek a wife elsewhere. He sat watching her with folded
arms, and in silence. Altogether they were a pleasant family party!

This is an atom: 
Jemima wanted to wind a skein of wool. Mr Farquhar saw it, and came to her, anxious to do her
this little service. She turned away pettishly, and asked Ruth to hold it for her.

This is an atom: 
Ruth was hurt for Mr Farquhar, and looked sorrowfully at Jemima; but Jemima would not see her
glance of upbraiding, as Ruth, hoping that she would relent, delayed a little to comply with
her request. Mr Farquhar did; and went back to his seat to watch them both. He saw Jemima turbulent
and stormy in look; he saw Ruth, to all appearance heavenly calm as the angels, or with only
that little tinge of sorrow which her friend's behaviour had called forth. He saw the unusual
beauty of her face and form, which he had never noticed before; and he saw Jemima, with all
the brilliancy she once possessed in eyes and complexion, dimmed and faded. He watched Ruth,
speaking low and soft to the little girls, who seemed to come to her in every difficulty; and
he remarked her gentle firmness when their bedtime came, and they pleaded to stay up longer
(their father was absent in his counting-house, or they would not have dared to do so). He
liked Ruth's soft, distinct, unwavering "No! you must go. You must keep to what is right,"
far better than the good-natured yielding to entreaty he had formerly admired in Jemima. He
was wandering off into this comparison, while Ruth, with delicate and unconscious tact, was
trying to lead Jemima into some subject which should take her away from the thoughts, whatever
they were, that made her so ungracious and rude.

This is an atom: 
Jemima was ashamed of herself before Ruth, in a way which she had never been before any one
else. She valued Ruth's good opinion so highly, that she dreaded lest her friend should perceive
her faults. She put a check upon herself--a check at first; but after a little time she had
forgotten something of her trouble, and listened to Ruth, and questioned her about Leonard,
and smiled at his little witticisms; and only the sighs, that would come up from the very force
of habit, brought back the consciousness of her unhappiness. Before the end of the evening,
Jemima had allowed herself to speak to Mr Farquhar in the old way--questioning, differing,
disputing. She was recalled to the remembrance of that miserable conversation by the entrance
of her father. After that she was silent. But he had seen her face more animated, and bright
with a smile, as she spoke to Mr Farquhar; and although he regretted the loss of her complexion
(for she was still very pale), he was highly pleased with the success of his project. He never
doubted but that Ruth had given her some sort of private exhortation to behave better. He could
not have understood the pretty art with which, by simply banishing unpleasant subjects, and
throwing a wholesome natural sunlit tone over others, Ruth had insensibly drawn Jemima out
of her gloom. He resolved to buy Mrs Denbigh a handsome silk gown the very next day. He did
not believe she had a silk gown, poor creature! He had noticed that dark grey stuff, this long,
long time, as her Sunday dress. He liked the colour; the silk one should be just the same tinge.
Then he thought that it would, perhaps, be better to choose a lighter shade, one which might
be noticed as different to the old gown. For he had no doubt she would like to have it remarked,
and, perhaps, would not object to tell people, that it was a present from Mr Bradshaw--a token
of his approbation. He smiled a little to himself as he thought of this additional source of
pleasure to Ruth. She, in the meantime, was getting up to go home. While Jemima was lighting
the bed-candle at the lamp, Ruth came round to bid good night. Mr Bradshaw could not allow
her to remain till the morrow, uncertain whether he was satisfied or not.

This is an atom: 
"Good night, Mrs Denbigh," said he. "Good night. Thank you. I am obliged to you--I am exceedingly
obliged to you."

This is an atom: 
He laid emphasis on these words, for he was pleased to see Mr Farquhar step forward to help
Jemima in her little office.

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar offered to accompany Ruth home; but the streets that intervened between Mr Bradshaw's
and the Chapel-house were so quiet that he desisted, when he learnt from Ruth's manner how
much she disliked his proposal. Mr Bradshaw, too, instantly observed:

This is an atom: 
"Oh! Mrs Denbigh need not trouble you, Farquhar. I have servants at liberty at any moment to
attend on her, if she wishes it."

This is an atom: 
In fact, he wanted to make hay while the sun shone, and to detain Mr Farquhar a little longer,
now that Jemima was so gracious. She went upstairs with Ruth to help her to put on her things.

This is an atom: 
"Dear Jemima!" said Ruth, "I am so glad to see you looking better to-night! You quite frightened
me this morning, you looked so ill."

This is an atom: 
"Did I?" replied Jemima. "Oh, Ruth! I have been so unhappy lately. I want you to come and put
me to rights," she continued, half smiling. "You know I'm a sort of out-pupil of yours, though
we are so nearly of an age. You ought to lecture me, and make me good."

This is an atom: 
"Should I, dear?" said Ruth. "I don't think I'm the one to do it."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes! you are--you've done me good to-night."

This is an atom: 
"Well, if I can do anything for you, tell me what it is?" asked Ruth, tenderly.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, not now--not now," replied Jemima. "I could not tell you here. It's a long story, and
I don't know that I can tell you at all. Mamma might come up at any moment, and papa would
be sure to ask what we had been talking about so long."

This is an atom: 
"Take your own time, love," said Ruth; "only remember, as far as I can, how glad I am to help you."

This is an atom: 
"You're too good, my darling!" said Jemima, fondly.

This is an atom: 
"Don't say so," replied Ruth, earnestly, almost as if she were afraid. "God knows I am not."

This is an atom: 
"Well! we're none of us too good," answered Jemima; "I know that. But you _are_ very good.
Nay, I won't call you so, if it makes you look so miserable. But come away downstairs."

This is an atom: 
With the fragrance of Ruth's sweetness lingering about her, Jemima was her best self during
the next half-hour. Mr Bradshaw was more and more pleased, and raised the price of the silk,
which he was going to give Ruth, sixpence a yard during the time. Mr Farquhar went home through
the garden-way, happier than he had been this long time. He even caught himself humming the
old refrain:

This is an atom: 
On revient, on revient toujours,
   A ses premiers amours.

This is an atom: 
But as soon as he was aware of what he was doing, he cleared away the remnants of the song
into a cough, which was sonorous, if not perfectly real.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXI

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar's Attentions Transferred

This is an atom: 
The next morning, as Jemima and her mother sat at their work, it came into the head of the
former to remember her father's very marked way of thanking Ruth the evening before.

This is an atom: 
"What a favourite Mrs Denbigh is with papa," said she. "I am sure I don't wonder at it. Did
you notice, mamma, how he thanked her for coming here last night?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, dear; but I don't think it was all--" Mrs Bradshaw stopped short. She was never certain
if it was right or wrong to say anything.

This is an atom: 
"Not all what?" asked Jemima, when she saw her mother was not going to finish the sentence.

This is an atom: 
"Not all because Mrs Denbigh came to tea here," replied Mrs Bradshaw.

This is an atom: 
"Why, what else could he be thanking her for? What has she done?" asked Jemima, stimulated
to curiosity by her mother's hesitating manner.

This is an atom: 
"I don't know if I ought to tell you," said Mrs Bradshaw.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, very well!" said Jemima, rather annoyed.

This is an atom: 
"Nay, dear! your papa never said I was not to tell; perhaps I may."

This is an atom: 
"Never mind! I don't want to hear," in a piqued tone.

This is an atom: 
There was silence for a little while. Jemima was trying to think of something else, but her
thoughts would revert to the wonder what Mrs Denbigh could have done for her father.

This is an atom: 
"I think I may tell you, though," said Mrs Bradshaw, half questioning.

This is an atom: 
Jemima had the honour not to urge any confidence, but she was too curious to take any active
step towards repressing it.

This is an atom: 
Mrs Bradshaw went on. "I think you deserve to know. It is partly your doing that papa is so
pleased with Mrs Denbigh. He is going to buy her a silk gown this morning, and I think you
ought to know why."

This is an atom: 
"Why?" asked Jemima.

This is an atom: 
"Because papa is so pleased to find that you mind what she says."

This is an atom: 
"I mind what she says! To be sure I do, and always did. But why should papa give her a gown
for that? I think he ought to give it me rather," said Jemima, half laughing.

This is an atom: 
"I am sure he would, dear; he will give you one, I am certain, if you want one. He was so pleased
to see you like your old self to Mr Farquhar last night. We neither of us could think what
had come over you this last month; but now all seems right."

This is an atom: 
A dark cloud came over Jemima's face. She did not like this close observation and constant
comment upon her manners; and what had Ruth to do with it?

This is an atom: 
"I am glad you were pleased," said she, very coldly. Then, after a pause, she added, "But you
have not told me what Mrs Denbigh had to do with my good behaviour."

This is an atom: 
"Did not she speak to you about it?" asked Mrs Bradshaw, looking up.

This is an atom: 
"No; why should she? She has no right to criticise what I do. She would not be so impertinent,"
said Jemima, feeling very uncomfortable and suspicious.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, love! she would have had a right, for papa had desired her to do it."

This is an atom: 
"Papa desired her! What do you mean, mamma?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, dear! I dare say I should not have told you," said Mrs Bradshaw, perceiving, from Jemima's
tone of voice, that something had gone wrong. "Only you spoke as if it would be impertinent
in Mrs Denbigh, and I am sure she would not do anything that was impertinent. You know, it
would be but right for her to do what papa told her; and he said a great deal to her, the other
day, about finding out why you were so cross, and bringing you right. And you are right now,
dear!" said Mrs Bradshaw, soothingly, thinking that Jemima was annoyed (like a good child)
at the recollection of how naughty she had been.

This is an atom: 
"Then papa is going to give Mrs Denbigh a gown because I was civil to Mr Farquhar last night?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, dear!" said Mrs Bradshaw, more and more frightened at Jemima's angry manner of speaking--low-toned,
but very indignant.

This is an atom: 
Jemima remembered, with smouldered anger, Ruth's pleading way of wiling her from her sullenness
the night before. Management everywhere! but in this case it was peculiarly revolting; so much
so, that she could hardly bear to believe that the seemingly-transparent Ruth had lent herself
to it.

This is an atom: 
"Are you sure, mamma, that papa asked Mrs Denbigh to make me behave differently? It seems so
strange."

This is an atom: 
"I am quite sure. He spoke to her last Friday morning in the study. I remember it was Friday,
because Mrs Dean was working here."

This is an atom: 
Jemima remembered now that she had gone into the school-room on the Friday, and found her sisters
lounging about, and wondering what papa could possibly want with Mrs Denbigh.

This is an atom: 
After this conversation, Jemima repulsed all Ruth's timid efforts to ascertain the cause of
her disturbance, and to help her if she could. Ruth's tender, sympathising manner, as she saw
Jemima daily looking more wretched, was distasteful to the latter in the highest degree. She
could not say that Mrs Denbigh's conduct was positively wrong--it might even be quite right;
but it was inexpressibly repugnant to her to think of her father consulting with a stranger
(a week ago she almost considered Ruth as a sister) how to manage his daughter, so as to obtain
the end he wished for; yes, even if that end was for her own good.

This is an atom: 
She was thankful and glad to see a brown paper parcel lying on the hall-table, with a note
in Ruth's handwriting, addressed to her father. She _knew_ what it was, the grey silk dress.
That she was sure Ruth would never accept.

This is an atom: 
No one henceforward could induce Jemima to enter into conversation with Mr Farquhar. She suspected
manoeuvring in the simplest actions, and was miserable in this constant state of suspicion.
She would not allow herself to like Mr Farquhar, even when he said things the most after her
own heart. She heard him, one evening, talking with her father about the principles of trade.
Her father stood out for the keenest, sharpest work, consistent with honesty; if he had not
been her father she would, perhaps, have thought some of his sayings inconsistent with true
Christian honesty. He was for driving hard bargains, exacting interest and payment of just
bills to a day. That was (he said) the only way in which trade could be conducted. Once allow
a margin of uncertainty, or where feelings, instead of maxims, were to be the guide, and all
hope of there ever being any good men of business was ended.

This is an atom: 
"Suppose a delay of a month in requiring payment might save a man's credit--prevent his becoming
a bankrupt?" put in Mr Farquhar.

This is an atom: 
"I would not give it him. I would let him have money to set up again as soon as he had passed
the Bankruptcy Court; if he never passed, I might, in some cases, make him an allowance; but
I would always keep my justice and my charity separate."

This is an atom: 
"And yet charity (in your sense of the word) degrades; justice, tempered with mercy and consideration,
elevates."

This is an atom: 
"That is not justice--justice is certain and inflexible. No! Mr Farquhar, you must not allow
any Quixotic notions to mingle with your conduct as a tradesman."

This is an atom: 
And so they went on; Jemima's face glowing with sympathy in all Mr Farquhar said; till once,
on looking up suddenly with sparkling eyes, she saw a glance of her father's which told her,
as plain as words could say, that he was watching the effect of Mr Farquhar's speeches upon
his daughter. She was chilled thenceforward; she thought her father prolonged the argument,
in order to call out those sentiments which he knew would most recommend his partner to his
daughter. She would so fain have let herself love Mr Farquhar; but this constant manoeuvring,
in which she did not feel clear that he did not take a passive part, made her sick at heart.
She even wished that they might not go through the form of pretending to try to gain her consent
to the marriage, if it involved all this premeditated action and speech-making--such moving
about of every one into their right places, like pieces at chess. She felt as if she would
rather be bought openly, like an Oriental daughter, where no one is degraded in their own eyes
by being parties to such a contract. The consequences of all this "admirable management" of
Mr Bradshaw's would have been very unfortunate to Mr Farquhar (who was innocent of all connivance
in any of the plots--indeed, would have been as much annoyed at them as Jemima, had he been
aware of them), but that the impression made upon him by Ruth on the evening I have so lately
described, was deepened by the contrast which her behaviour made to Miss Bradshaw's on one
or two more recent occasions.

This is an atom: 
There was no use, he thought, in continuing attentions so evidently distasteful to Jemima.
To her, a young girl hardly out of the schoolroom, he probably appeared like an old man; and
he might even lose the friendship with which she used to regard him, and which was, and ever
would be, very dear to him, if he persevered in trying to be considered as a lover. He should
always feel affectionately towards her; her very faults gave her an interest in his eyes, for
which he had blamed himself most conscientiously and most uselessly when he was looking upon
her as his future wife, but which the said conscience would learn to approve of when she sank
down to the place of a young friend, over whom he might exercise a good and salutary interest.
Mrs Denbigh, if not many months older in years, had known sorrow and cares so early that she
was much older in character. Besides, her shy reserve, and her quiet daily walk within the
lines of duty, were much in accordance with Mr Farquhar's notion of what a wife should be.
Still, it was a wrench to take his affections away from Jemima. If she had not helped him to
do so by every means in her power, he could never have accomplished it.

This is an atom: 
Yes! by every means in her power had Jemima alienated her lover, her beloved--for so he was
in fact. And now her quick-sighted eyes saw he was gone for ever--past recall; for did not
her jealous, sore heart feel, even before he himself was conscious of the fact, that he was
drawn towards sweet, lovely, composed, and dignified Ruth--one who always thought before she
spoke (as Mr Farquhar used to bid Jemima do)--who never was tempted by sudden impulse, but
walked the world calm and self-governed. What now availed Jemima's reproaches, as she remembered
the days when he had watched her with earnest, attentive eyes, as he now watched Ruth; and
the times since, when, led astray by her morbid fancy, she had turned away from all his advances!

This is an atom: 
"It was only in March--last March, he called me 'dear Jemima.' Ah, don't I remember it well?
The pretty nosegay of green-house flowers that he gave me in exchange for the wild daffodils--and
how he seemed to care for the flowers I gave him--and how he looked at me, and thanked me--that
is all gone and over now."

This is an atom: 
Her sisters came in bright and glowing.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Jemima, how nice and cool you are, sitting in this shady room!" (She had felt it even
chilly.) "We have been such a long walk! We are so tired. It is so hot."

This is an atom: 
"Why did you go, then?" said she.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! we wanted to go. We would not have stayed at home on any account. It has been so pleasant,"
said Mary.

This is an atom: 
"We've been to Scaurside Wood, to gather wild strawberries," said Elizabeth. "Such a quantity!
We've left a whole basketful in the dairy. Mr Farquhar says he'll teach us how to dress them
in the way he learnt in Germany, if we can get him some hock. Do you think papa will let us
have some?"

This is an atom: 
"Was Mr Farquhar with you?" asked Jemima, a dull light coming into her eyes.

This is an atom: 
"Yes; we told him this morning that mamma wanted us to take some old linen to the lame man
at Scaurside Farm, and that we meant to coax Mrs Denbigh to let us go into the wood and gather
strawberries," said Elizabeth.

This is an atom: 
"I thought he would make some excuse and come," said the quick-witted Mary, as eager and thoughtless
an observer of one love-affair as of another, and quite forgetting that, not many weeks ago,
she had fancied an attachment between him and Jemima.

This is an atom: 
"Did you? I did not," replied Elizabeth. "At least I never thought about it. I was quite startled
when I heard his horse's feet behind us on the road."

This is an atom: 
"He said he was going to the farm, and could take our basket. Was not it kind of him?" Jemima
did not answer, so Mary continued:

This is an atom: 
"You know it's a great pull up to the farm, and we were so hot already. The road was quite
white and baked; it hurt my eyes terribly. I was so glad when Mrs Denbigh said we might turn
into the wood. The light was quite green there, the branches are so thick overhead."

This is an atom: 
"And there are whole beds of wild strawberries," said Elizabeth, taking up the tale now Mary
was out of breath. Mary fanned herself with her bonnet, while Elizabeth went on:

This is an atom: 
"You know where the grey rock crops out, don't you, Jemima? Well, there was a complete carpet
of strawberry runners. So pretty! And we could hardly step without treading the little bright
scarlet berries under foot."

This is an atom: 
"We did so wish for Leonard," put in Mary.

This is an atom: 
"Yes! but Mrs Denbigh gathered a great many for him. And Mr Farquhar gave her all his."

This is an atom: 
"I thought you said he had gone on to Dawson's farm," said Jemima.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, yes! he just went up there; and then he left his horse there, like a wise man, and came
to us in the pretty, cool, green wood. Oh, Jemima, it was so pretty--little flecks of light
coming down here and there through the leaves, and quivering on the ground. You must go with
us to-morrow."

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said Mary, "we're going again to-morrow. We could not gather nearly all the strawberries."

This is an atom: 
"And Leonard is to go too, to-morrow."

This is an atom: 
"Yes! we thought of such a capital plan. That's to say, Mr Farquhar thought of it--we wanted
to carry Leonard up the hill in a king's cushion, but Mrs Denbigh would not hear of it."

This is an atom: 
"She said it would tire us so; and yet she wanted him to gather strawberries!"

This is an atom: 
"And so," interrupted Mary, for by this time the two girls were almost speaking together, "Mr
Farquhar is to bring him up before him on his horse."

This is an atom: 
"You'll go with us, won't you, dear Jemima?" asked Elizabeth; "it will be at--"

This is an atom: 
"No! I can't go!" said Jemima, abruptly. "Don't ask me--I can't."

This is an atom: 
The little girls were hushed into silence by her manner; for whatever she might be to those
above her in age and position, to those below her Jemima was almost invariably gentle. She
felt that they were wondering at her.

This is an atom: 
"Go upstairs and take off your things. You know papa does not like you to come into this room
in the shoes in which you have been out."

This is an atom: 
She was glad to cut her sisters short in the details which they were so mercilessly inflicting--details
which she must harden herself to, before she could hear them quietly and unmoved. She saw that
she had lost her place as the first object in Mr Farquhar's eyes--a position she had hardly
cared for while she was secure in the enjoyment of it; but the charm of it now was redoubled,
in her acute sense of how she had forfeited it by her own doing, and her own fault. For if
he were the cold, calculating man her father had believed him to be, and had represented him
as being to her, would he care for a portionless widow in humble circumstances like Mrs Denbigh;
no money, no connexion, encumbered with her boy? The very action which proved Mr Farquhar to
be lost to Jemima reinstated him on his throne in her fancy. And she must go on in hushed quietness,
quivering with every fresh token of his preference for another! That other, too, one so infinitely
more worthy of him than herself; so that she could not have even the poor comfort of thinking
that he had no discrimination, and was throwing himself away on a common or worthless person.
Ruth was beautiful, gentle, good, and conscientious. The hot colour flushed up into Jemima's
sallow face as she became aware that, even while she acknowledged these excellences on Mrs
Denbigh's part, she hated her. The recollection of her marble face wearied her even to sickness;
the tones of her low voice were irritating from their very softness. Her goodness, undoubted
as it was, was more distasteful than many faults which had more savour of human struggle in them.

This is an atom: 
"What was this terrible demon in her heart?" asked Jemima's better angel. "Was she, indeed,
given up to possession? Was not this the old stinging hatred which had prompted so many crimes?
The hatred of all sweet virtues which might win the love denied to us? The old anger that wrought
in the elder brother's heart, till it ended in the murder of the gentle Abel, while yet the
world was young?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, God! help me! I did not know I was so wicked," cried Jemima aloud in her agony. It had
been a terrible glimpse into the dark, lurid gulf--the capability for evil, in her heart. She
wrestled with the demon, but he would not depart; it was to be a struggle whether or not she
was to be given up to him, in this her time of sore temptation.

This is an atom: 
All the next day long she sat and pictured the happy strawberry gathering going on, even then,
in pleasant Scaurside Wood. Every touch of fancy which could heighten her idea of their enjoyment,
and of Mr Farquhar's attention to the blushing, conscious Ruth--every such touch which would
add a pang to her self-reproach and keen jealousy, was added by her imagination. She got up
and walked about, to try and stop her over-busy fancy by bodily exercise. But she had eaten
little all day, and was weak and faint in the intense heat of the sunny garden. Even the long
grass-walk under the filbert-hedge, was parched and dry in the glowing August sun. Yet her
sisters found her there when they returned, walking quickly up and down, as if to warm herself
on some winter's day. They were very weary; and not half so communicative as on the day before,
now that Jemima was craving for every detail to add to her agony.

This is an atom: 
"Yes! Leonard came up before Mr Farquhar. Oh! how hot it is, Jemima; do sit down, and I'll
tell you about it, but I can't if you keep walking so!"

This is an atom: 
"I can't sit still to-day," said Jemima, springing up from the turf as soon as she had sat
down. "Tell me! I can hear you while I walk about."

This is an atom: 
"Oh! but I can't shout; I can hardly speak I am so tired. Mr Farquhar brought Leonard--"

This is an atom: 
"You've told me that before," said Jemima, sharply.

This is an atom: 
"Well! I don't know what else to tell. Somebody had been since yesterday, and gathered nearly
all the strawberries off the grey rock. Jemima! Jemima!" said Elizabeth, faintly, "I am so
dizzy--I think I am ill."

This is an atom: 
The next minute the tired girl lay swooning on the grass. It was an outlet for Jemima's fierce
energy. With a strength she had never again, and never had known before, she lifted up her
fainting sister, and bidding Mary run and clear the way, she carried her in through the open
garden-door, up the wide old-fashioned stairs, and laid her on the bed in her own room, where
the breeze from the window came softly and pleasantly through the green shade of the vine-leaves
and jessamine.

This is an atom: 
"Give me the water. Run for mamma, Mary," said Jemima, as she saw that the fainting-fit did
not yield to the usual remedy of a horizontal position and the water sprinkling.

This is an atom: 
"Dear! dear Lizzie!" said Jemima, kissing the pale, unconscious face. "I think you loved me,
darling."

This is an atom: 
The long walk on the hot day had been too much for the delicate Elizabeth, who was fast outgrowing
her strength. It was many days before she regained any portion of her spirit and vigour. After
that fainting-fit, she lay listless and weary, without appetite or interest, through the long
sunny autumn weather, on the bed or on the couch in Jemima's room, whither she had been carried
at first. It was a comfort to Mrs Bradshaw to be able at once to discover what it was that
had knocked up Elizabeth; she did not rest easily until she had settled upon a cause for every
ailment or illness in the family. It was a stern consolation to Mr Bradshaw, during his time
of anxiety respecting his daughter, to be able to blame somebody. He could not, like his wife,
have taken comfort from an inanimate fact; he wanted the satisfaction of feeling that some
one had been in fault, or else this never could have happened. Poor Ruth did not need his implied
reproaches. When she saw her gentle Elizabeth lying feeble and languid, her heart blamed her
for thoughtlessness so severely as to make her take all Mr Bradshaw's words and hints as too
light censure for the careless way in which, to please her own child, she had allowed her two
pupils to fatigue themselves with such long walks. She begged hard to take her share of nursing.
Every spare moment she went to Mr Bradshaw's, and asked, with earnest humility, to be allowed
to pass them with Elizabeth; and, as it was often a relief to have her assistance, Mrs Bradshaw
received these entreaties very kindly, and desired her to go upstairs, where Elizabeth's pale
countenance brightened when she saw her, but where Jemima sat in silent annoyance that her
own room was now become open ground for one, whom her heart rose up against, to enter in and
be welcomed. Whether it was that Ruth, who was not an inmate of the house, brought with her
a fresher air, more change of thought to the invalid, I do not know, but Elizabeth always gave
her a peculiarly tender greeting; and if she had sunk down into languid fatigue, in spite of
all Jemima's endeavours to interest her, she roused up into animation when Ruth came in with
a flower, a book, or a brown and ruddy pear, sending out the warm fragrance it retained from
the sunny garden-wall at Chapel-house.

This is an atom: 
The jealous dislike which Jemima was allowing to grow up in her heart against Ruth was, as
she thought, never shown in word or deed. She was cold in manner, because she could not be
hypocritical; but her words were polite and kind in purport; and she took pains to make her
actions the same as formerly. But rule and line may measure out the figure of a man; it is
the soul that gives it life; and there was no soul, no inner meaning, breathing out in Jemima's
actions. Ruth felt the change acutely. She suffered from it some time before she ventured to
ask what had occasioned it. But, one day, she took Miss Bradshaw by surprise, when they were
alone together for a few minutes, by asking her if she had vexed her in any way, she was so
changed? It is sad when friendship has cooled so far as to render such a question necessary.
Jemima went rather paler than usual, and then made answer:

This is an atom: 
"Changed! How do you mean? How am I changed? What do I say or do different from what I used to do?"

This is an atom: 
But the tone was so constrained and cold, that Ruth's heart sank within her. She knew now,
as well as words could have told her, that not only had the old feeling of love passed away
from Jemima, but that it had gone unregretted, and no attempt had been made to recall it. Love
was very precious to Ruth now, as of old time. It was one of the faults of her nature to be
ready to make any sacrifices for those who loved her, and to value affection almost above its
price. She had yet to learn the lesson, that it is more blessed to love than to be beloved;
and lonely as the impressible years of her youth had been--without parents, without brother
or sister--it was, perhaps, no wonder that she clung tenaciously to every symptom of regard,
and could not relinquish the love of any one without a pang.

This is an atom: 
The doctor who was called in to Elizabeth prescribed sea-air as the best means of recruiting
her strength. Mr Bradshaw, who liked to spend money ostentatiously, went down straight to Abermouth,
and engaged a house for the remainder of the autumn; for, as he told the medical man, money
was no object to him in comparison with his children's health; and the doctor cared too little
about the mode in which his remedy was administered, to tell Mr Bradshaw that lodgings would
have done as well, or better, than the complete house he had seen fit to take. For it was now
necessary to engage servants, and take much trouble, which might have been obviated, and Elizabeth's
removal effected more quietly and speedily, if she had gone into lodgings. As it was, she was
weary of hearing all the planning and talking, and deciding and un-deciding, and re-deciding,
before it was possible for her to go. Her only comfort was in the thought that dear Mrs Denbigh
was to go with her.

This is an atom: 
It had not been entirely by way of pompously spending his money that Mr Bradshaw had engaged
this seaside house. He was glad to get his little girls and their governess out of the way;
for a busy time was impending, when he should want his head clear for electioneering purposes,
and his house clear for electioneering hospitality. He was the mover of a project for bringing
forward a man on the Liberal and Dissenting interest, to contest the election with the old
Tory member, who had on several successive occasions walked over the course, as he and his
family owned half the town, and votes and rent were paid alike to the landlord.

This is an atom: 
Kings of Eccleston had Mr Cranworth and his ancestors been this many a long year; their right
was so little disputed that they never thought of acknowledging the allegiance so readily paid
to them. The old feudal feeling between land-owner and tenant did not quake prophetically at
the introduction of manufactures; the Cranworth family ignored the growing power of the manufacturers,
more especially as the principal person engaged in the trade was a Dissenter. But notwithstanding
this lack of patronage from the one great family in the neighbourhood, the business flourished,
increased, and spread wide; and the Dissenting head thereof looked around, about the time of
which I speak, and felt himself powerful enough to defy the great Cranworth interest even in
their hereditary stronghold, and, by so doing, avenge the slights of many years--slights which
rankled in Mr Bradshaw's mind as much as if he did not go to chapel twice every Sunday, and
pay the largest pew-rent of any member of Mr Benson's congregation.

This is an atom: 
Accordingly, Mr Bradshaw had applied to one of the Liberal parliamentary agents in London--a
man whose only principle was to do wrong on the Liberal side; he would not act, right or wrong,
for a Tory, but for a Whig the latitude of his conscience had never yet been discovered. It
was possible Mr Bradshaw was not aware of the character of this agent; at any rate, he knew
he was the man for his purpose, which was to hear of some one who would come forward as a candidate
for the representation of Eccleston on the Dissenting interest.

This is an atom: 
"There are in round numbers about six hundred voters," said he; "two hundred are decidedly
in the Cranworth interest--dare not offend Mr Cranworth, poor souls! Two hundred more we may
calculate upon as pretty certain--factory hands, or people connected with our trade in some
way or another--who are indignant at the stubborn way in which Cranworth has contested the
right of water; two hundred are doubtful."

This is an atom: 
"Don't much care either way," said the parliamentary agent. "Of course, we must make them care."

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw rather shrunk from the knowing look with which this was said. He hoped that Mr
Pilson did not mean to allude to bribery; but he did not express this hope, because he thought
it would deter the agent from using this means, and it was possible it might prove to be the
only way. And if he (Mr Bradshaw) once embarked on such an enterprise, there must be no failure.
By some expedient or another, success must be certain, or he could have nothing to do with it.

This is an atom: 
The parliamentary agent was well accustomed to deal with all kinds and shades of scruples.
He was most at home with men who had none; but still he could allow for human weakness; and
he perfectly understood Mr Bradshaw.

This is an atom: 
"I have a notion I know of a man who will just suit your purpose. Plenty of money--does not
know what to do with it, in fact--tired of yachting, travelling; wants something new. I heard,
through some of the means of intelligence I employ, that not very long ago he was wishing for
a seat in Parliament."

This is an atom: 
"A Liberal?" said Mr Bradshaw.

This is an atom: 
"Decidedly. Belongs to a family who were in the Long Parliament in their day."

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw rubbed his hands.

This is an atom: 
"Dissenter?" asked he.

This is an atom: 
"No, no! Not so far as that. But very lax Church."

This is an atom: 
"What is his name?" asked Mr Bradshaw, eagerly.

This is an atom: 
"Excuse me. Until I am certain that he would like to come forward for Eccleston, I think I
had better not mention his name."

This is an atom: 
The anonymous gentleman did like to come forward, and his name proved to be Donne. He and Mr
Bradshaw had been in correspondence during all the time of Mr Ralph Cranworth's illness; and
when he died, everything was arranged ready for a start, even before the Cranworths had determined
who should keep the seat warm till the eldest son came of age, for the father was already member
for the county. Mr Donne was to come down to canvass in person, and was to take up his abode
at Mr Bradshaw's; and therefore it was that the seaside house, within twenty miles' distance
of Eccleston, was found to be so convenient as an infirmary and nursery for those members of
his family who were likely to be useless, if not positive encumbrances, during the forthcoming
election.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXII

This is an atom: 
The Liberal Candidate and His Precursor

This is an atom: 
Jemima did not know whether she wished to go to Abermouth or not. She longed for change. She
wearied of the sights and sounds of home. But yet she could not bear to leave the neighbourhood
of Mr Farquhar; especially as, if she went to Abermouth, Ruth would in all probability be left
to take her holiday at home.

This is an atom: 
When Mr Bradshaw decided that she was to go, Ruth tried to feel glad that he gave her the means
of repairing her fault towards Elizabeth; and she resolved to watch over the two girls most
faithfully and carefully, and to do all in her power to restore the invalid to health. But
a tremor came over her whenever she thought of leaving Leonard; she had never quitted him for
a day, and it seemed to her as if her brooding, constant care was his natural and necessary
shelter from all evils--from very death itself. She would not go to sleep at nights, in order
to enjoy the blessed consciousness of having him near her; when she was away from him teaching
her pupils, she kept trying to remember his face, and print it deep on her heart, against the
time when days and days would elapse without her seeing that little darling countenance. Miss
Benson would wonder to her brother that Mr Bradshaw did not propose that Leonard should accompany
his mother; he only begged her not to put such an idea into Ruth's head, as he was sure Mr
Bradshaw had no thoughts of doing any such thing, yet to Ruth it might be a hope, and then
a disappointment. His sister scolded him for being so cold-hearted; but he was full of sympathy,
although he did not express it, and made some quiet little sacrifices in order to set himself
at liberty to take Leonard a long walking expedition on the day when his mother left Eccleston.

This is an atom: 
Ruth cried until she could cry no longer, and felt very much ashamed of herself as she saw
the grave and wondering looks of her pupils, whose only feeling on leaving home was delight
at the idea of Abermouth, and into whose minds the possibility of death to any of their beloved
ones never entered. Ruth dried her eyes, and spoke cheerfully as soon as she caught the perplexed
expression of their faces; and by the time they arrived at Abermouth, she was as much delighted
with all the new scenery as they were, and found it hard work to resist their entreaties to
go rambling out on the seashore at once; but Elizabeth had undergone more fatigue that day
than she had had before for many weeks, and Ruth was determined to be prudent.

This is an atom: 
Meanwhile, the Bradshaws' house at Eccleston was being rapidly adapted for electioneering hospitality.
The partition-wall between the unused drawing-room and the school-room was broken down, in
order to admit of folding doors; the "ingenious" upholsterer of the town (and what town does
not boast of the upholsterer full of contrivances and resources, in opposition to the upholsterer
of steady capital and no imagination, who looks down with uneasy contempt on ingenuity?) had
come in to give his opinion, that "nothing could be easier than to convert a bathroom into
a bedroom, by the assistance of a little drapery to conceal the shower-bath," the string of
which was to be carefully concealed, for fear that the unconscious occupier of the bath-bed
might innocently take it for a bell-rope. The professional cook of the town had been already
engaged to take up her abode for a month at Mr Bradshaw's, much to the indignation of Betsy,
who became a vehement partisan of Mr Cranworth, as soon as ever she heard of the plan of her
deposition from sovereign authority in the kitchen, in which she had reigned supreme for fourteen
years. Mrs Bradshaw sighed and bemoaned herself in all her leisure moments, which were not
many, and wondered why their house was to be turned into an inn for this Mr Donne, when everybody
knew that the George was good enough for the Cranworths, who never thought of asking the electors
to the Hall;--and they had lived at Cranworth ever since Julius Caesar's time, and if that
was not being an old family, she did not know what was. The excitement soothed Jemima. There
was something to do. It was she who planned with the upholsterer; it was she who soothed Betsy
into angry silence; it was she who persuaded her mother to lie down and rest, while she herself
went out to buy the heterogeneous things required to make the family and house presentable
to Mr Donne and his precursor--the friend of the parliamentary agent. This latter gentleman
never appeared himself on the scene of action, but pulled all the strings notwithstanding.
The friend was a Mr Hickson, a lawyer--a briefless barrister, some people called him; but he
himself professed a great disgust to the law, as a "great sham," which involved an immensity
of underhand action, and truckling, and time-serving, and was perfectly encumbered by useless
forms and ceremonies, and dead obsolete words. So, instead of putting his shoulder to the wheel
to reform the law, he talked eloquently against it, in such a high-priest style, that it was
occasionally a matter of surprise how he could ever have made a friend of the parliamentary
agent before mentioned. But, as Mr Hickson himself said, it was the very corruptness of the
law which he was fighting against, in doing all he could to effect the return of certain members
to Parliament; these certain members being pledged to effect a reform in the law, according
to Mr Hickson. And, as he once observed confidentially, "If you had to destroy a hydra-headed
monster, would you measure swords with the demon as if he were a gentleman? Would you not rather
seize the first weapon that came to hand? And so do I. My great object in life, sir, is to
reform the law of England, sir. Once get a majority of Liberal members into the House, and
the thing is done. _Timotheus._ Would you, O Lucian, be classed among the atheists, like
Epicurus?

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ It lies not at my discretion what name shall be given me at present or hereafter, any
more than it did at my birth. But I wonder at the ignorance and
precipitancy of those who call Epicurus an atheist.

This is an atom: 
He saw on the same earth with himself a great variety of inferior creatures, some possessing
more sensibility and more thoughtfulness than others. Analogy would lead so contemplative
a reasoner to the conclusion that if many were inferior and in sight, others might be superior
and out of sight. He never disbelieved in the existence of the gods; he only disbelieved that
they troubled their heads with our concerns. Have they none of their own? If they are happy,
does their happiness depend on us, comparatively so imbecile and vile?
He believed, as nearly all nations do, in different ranks and orders of superhuman beings;
and perhaps he thought (but I never was in his confidence or counsels) that the higher were
rather in communication with the next to them in intellectual faculties, than with the most
remote. To me the suggestion appears by no means irrational, that if we are managed or cared
for at all by beings wiser than ourselves (which in truth would be no sign of any great
wisdom in them), it can only be by such as are very far from perfection, and who indulge us
in the commission of innumerable faults and follies, for their own speculation or
amusement.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ There is only one such; and he is the devil.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ If he delights in our wickedness, which you believe, he
must be incomparably the happiest of beings, which you do not
believe.

This is an atom: 
No god of Epicurus rests his elbow on his armchair with less energetic exertion or
discomposure.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ We lead holier and purer lives than such ignorant mortals as are not living under
Grace.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ I also live under Grace, O Timotheus!

This is an atom: 
and I venerate her for the pleasures I have received at her hands. I do not believe she has
quite deserted me. If my grey hairs are unattractive to her, and if the trace of her fingers
is lost in the wrinkles of my forehead, still I sometimes am told it is discernible even on
the latest and coldest of my writings.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ You are wilful in misapprehension. The Grace of which I speak is adverse to
pleasure and impurity.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ Rightly do you separate impurity and pleasure, which indeed soon fly asunder when
the improvident would unite them. But never believe that tenderness of heart signifies
corruption of morals, if you happen to find it (which indeed is unlikely) in the direction you
have taken; on the contrary, no two qualities are oftener found together, on mind as on
matter, than hardness and lubricity.

This is an atom: 
Believe me, Cousin Timotheus, when we come to eighty years of age we are all Essenes. In our kingdom
of heaven there is no marrying or giving in marriage; and austerity in ourselves, when Nature
holds over us the sharp instrument with which Jupiter operated on
Saturn, makes us austere to others.

This is an atom: 
But how happens it that you, both old and young, break every bond which connected you anciently
with the Essenes? Not only do you marry (a height of wisdom to which I never have attained,
although in others I commend it), but you never share your substance with the poorest of
your community, as they did, nor live simply and frugally, nor purchase nor employ slaves, nor
refuse rank and offices in the State, nor abstain from litigation, nor abominate and execrate
the wounds and cruelties of war. The Essenes did all this, and greatly more, if Josephus and
Philo, whose political and religious tenets are opposite to theirs, are credible and
trustworthy.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ Doubtless you would also wish us to retire into the
desert, and eschew the conversation of mankind.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ No, indeed; but I would wish the greater part of your people to eschew mine, for
they bring all the worst of the desert with them whenever they enter; its smothering heats,
its blinding sands, its sweeping suffocation.

This is an atom: 
Return to the pure spirit of the Essenes, without their asceticism; cease from controversy, and
drop party designations.

This is an atom: 
If you will not do this, do less, and be merely what you profess to be, which is quite enough
for an honest, a virtuous, and a religious man.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ Cousin Lucian, I did not come hither to receive a lecture from you.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ I have often given a dinner to a friend who did not come to dine with me.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ Then, I trust, you gave him something better for dinner
than bay-salt and dandelions.

This is an atom: 
If you will not assist us in nettling our enemies a little for their absurdities and impositions,
let me entreat you, however, to let us alone, and to make no remarks on us. I myself run into no
extravagances, like the Essenes, washing and fasting, and retiring into solitude. I am not
called to them; when I am, I go.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ I am apprehensive the Lord may afflict you with deafness in that ear.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ Nevertheless, I am indifferent to the world, and all things in it. This, I
trust, you will acknowledge to be true religion and true philosophy.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ That is not philosophy which betrays an indifference to those for whose benefit
philosophy was designed; and those are the whole human race. But I hold it to be the most
unphilosophical thing in the world to call away men from useful occupations and mutual help,
to profitless speculations and acrid controversies. Censurable enough, and contemptible, too,
is that supercilious philosopher, sneeringly sedate, who narrates in full and flowing periods
the persecutions and tortures of a fellow-man, led astray by his credulity, and ready to
die in the assertion of what in his soul he believes to be the truth. But hardly less
censurable, hardly less contemptible, is the tranquilly arrogant sectarian, who denies that
wisdom or honesty can exist beyond the limits of his own ill-lighted chamber.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ What! is he sanguinary?

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ Whenever he can be, he is; and he always has it in his power to be even worse than
that, for he refuses his custom to the industrious and honest shopkeeper who has been taught to
think differently from himself in matters which he has had no leisure to study, and by which,
if he had enjoyed that leisure, he would have been a less industrious
and a less expert artificer.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ We cannot countenance those hard-hearted men who refuse to hear the word of the
Lord.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ The hard-hearted knowing this of the tender-hearted, and receiving the declaration from
their own lips, will refuse to hear the word of the Lord all their lives.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ Well, well; it cannot be helped. I see, cousin, my hopes of obtaining a little
of your assistance in your own pleasant way are disappointed; but it is something to have conceived
a better hope of saving your soul, from your readiness to acknowledge your belief in
miracles.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ Miracles have existed in all ages and in all religions. Witnesses to some of them have
been numerous; to others of them fewer.

This is an atom: 
Occasionally, the witnesses have been disinterested in the result.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ Now indeed you speak truly and wisely.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ But sometimes the most honest and the most quiescent have either been unable or unwilling to
push themselves so forward as to see clearly and distinctly the
whole of the operation; and have listened to some knave who felt a
pleasure in deluding their credulity, or some other who himself was
either an enthusiast or a dupe.

This is an atom: 
It also may have happened in the ancient religions, of Egypt for instance, or of India, or even
of Greece, that narratives have been attributed to authors who never heard of them; and have
been circulated by honest men who firmly believed them; by half-honest, who indulged their
vanity in becoming members of a novel and bustling society; and by utterly dishonest, who, having
no other means of rising above the shoulders of the vulgar, threw dust into their eyes and
made them stoop.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ Ha! the rogues! It is nearly all over with them.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ Let us hope so. Parthenius and the Roman poet Ovidius Naso, have related the transformations
of sundry men, women, and gods.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ Idleness! Idleness! I never read such lying authors.

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ I myself have seen enough to incline me toward a belief in them.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ You? Why! you have always been thought an utter infidel; and now you are running,
hot and heedless as any mad dog, to the opposite extreme!

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ I have lived to see, not indeed one man, but certainly one animal turned into another; nay,
great numbers. I have seen sheep with the most placid faces in the morning, one nibbling the
tender herb with all its dew upon it; another, negligent of its own sustenance, and giving
it copiously to the tottering lamb aside it.

This is an atom: 
_Timotheus._ How pretty! half poetical!

This is an atom: 
_Lucian._ In the heat of the day I saw the very same sheep tearing off each other's fleeces
with long teeth and longer claws, and imitating so admirably the howl of wolves, that at last
the wolves came down on them in a body, and lent their best assistance at the general
devouring.
What is more remarkable, the people of the villages seemed to enjoy the sport; and, instead of
attacking the wolves, waited until they had filled their stomachs, ate the little that was
left, said piously and from the bottom of their hearts what you call _grace_, and went home
singing and piping.

This is an atom: 
BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
_Shipley._ There are very few men, even in the bushes and the
wilderness, who delight in the commission of cruelty; but nearly
all, throughout the earth, are censurable for the admission.

This is an atom: 
When we see a blow struck, we go on and think no more about it: yet every blow aimed at the
most distant of our fellow-creatures, is sure to come back, some time or other, to our
families and descendants. He who lights a fire in one quarter is ignorant to what other the
winds may carry it, and whether what is kindled in the wood may not break out again in the
cornfield.

This is an atom: 
_Franklin._ If we could restrain but one generation from deeds of violence, the foundation
for a new and a more graceful edifice of society would not only have been laid, but would have been
consolidated.

This is an atom: 
_Shipley._ We already are horrified at the bare mention of religious wars; we should then
be horrified at the mention of political. Why should they who, when they are affronted or
offended, abstain from inflicting blows, some from a sense of decorousness and others from
a sense of religion, be forward to instigate the infliction of ten thousand, all irremediable,
all murderous?
Every chief magistrate should be arbitrator and umpire in all differences between any two,
forbidding war. Much would be added to the dignity of the most powerful king by rendering him
an efficient member of such a grand Amphictyonic council. Unhappily they are persuaded in
childhood that a reign is made glorious by a successful war. What schoolmaster ever taught a
boy to question it? or indeed any point of political morality, or any incredible thing in
history? Caesar and Alexander are uniformly clement: Themistocles died by a draught of bull's
blood: Portia by swallowing red-hot pieces of charcoal.

This is an atom: 
_Franklin._ Certainly no woman or man could perform either of these feats. In my opinion it
lies beyond a doubt that Portia suffocated herself by the fumes
of charcoal; and that the Athenian, whose stomach must have been
formed on the model of other stomachs, and must therefore have
rejected a much less quantity of blood than would have poisoned
him, died by some chemical preparation, of which a bull's blood
might, or might not, have been part.

This is an atom: 
Schoolmasters who thus betray their trust, ought to be scourged by their scholars, like him of
their profession who underwent the just indignation of the Roman Consul. You shut up those who
are infected with the plague; why do you lay no coercion on those who are incurably possessed
by the legion devil of carnage? When a creature is of intellect so perverted that he can
discern no difference between a review and a battle, between the animating bugle and the dying
groan, it were expedient to remove him, as quietly as may be, from his devastation of God's earth
and his usurpation of God's authority.

This is an atom: 
Compassion points out the cell for him at the bottom of the hospital, and listens to hear the key
turned in the ward: until then the house is insecure.

This is an atom: 
_Shipley._ God grant our rulers wisdom, and our brethren peace!

This is an atom: 
_Franklin._ Here are but indifferent specimens and tokens. Those fellows throw stones pretty
well: if they practise much longer, they will hit us: let me entreat
you, my lord, to leave me here.

This is an atom: 
So long as the good people were contented with hooting and shouting at us, no great harm was
either done or apprehended: but now they are beginning to throw stones, perhaps they may
prove themselves more dexterous in action than their rulers have
done latterly in council.

This is an atom: 
_Shipley._ Take care, Doctor Franklin! _That_ was very near being the philosopher's stone.

This is an atom: 
_Franklin._ Let me pick it up, then, and send it to London by the
diligence.

This is an atom: 
But I am afraid your ministers, and the nation at large, are as
little in the way of wealth as of wisdom, in the experiment they
are making.

This is an atom: 
_Shipley._ While I was attending to you, William had started. Look! he has reached them:
they are listening to him.

This is an atom: 
Believe me, he has all the courage of an Englishman and of a
Christian; and, if the stoutest of them force him to throw off his
new black coat, the blusterer would soon think it better to have
listened to less polemical doctrine.

This is an atom: 
_Franklin._ Meantime a few of the town boys are come nearer, and
begin to grow troublesome.

This is an atom: 
I am sorry to requite your hospitality with such hard fare.

This is an atom: 
_Shipley._ True, these young bakers make their bread very gritty, but we must partake of it
together so long as you are with us.

This is an atom: 
_Franklin._ Be pleased, my lord, to give us grace; our repast is over; this is my boat.

This is an atom: 
_Shipley._ We will accompany you as far as to the ship. Thank God! we are now upon the water,
and all safe. Give me your hand, my good Doctor Franklin! and although you have failed in the
object of your mission, yet the intention will authorize me to
say, in the holy words of our Divine Redeemer, Blessed are the
peacemakers!

This is an atom: 
_Franklin._ My dear lord! if God ever blessed a man at the intercession of another, I may
reasonably and confidently hope in such a benediction. Never did one arise from a warmer, a
tenderer, or a purer heart.

This is an atom: 
_Shipley._ Infatuation! that England should sacrifice to her king so many thousands of her
bravest men, and ruin so many thousands of her most industrious,
in a vain attempt to destroy the very principles on which her
strength and her glory are founded!

This is an atom: 
The weakest prince that ever sat upon a throne, and the most needy and sordid Parliament that
ever pandered to distempered power, are thrusting our blindfold
nation from the pinnacle of prosperity.

This is an atom: 
_Franklin._ I believe _your_ king (from this moment it is permitted
me to call him _ours_ no longer) to be as honest and as wise a man
as any of those about him: but unhappily he can see no difference
between a review and a battle.

This is an atom: 
Such are the optics of most kings and rulers.
His Parliament, in both Houses, acts upon calculation.

This is an atom: 
There is hardly a family, in either, that does not anticipate the clear profit of several
thousands a year, to itself and its connexions.
Appointments to regiments and frigates raise the price of papers; and forfeited estates fly
confusedly about, and darken the air from the Thames to the Atlantic.

This is an atom: 
_Shipley._ It is lamentable to think that war, bringing with it every species of human misery,
should become a commercial speculation. Bad enough when it arises from revenge; another word
for honour.

This is an atom: 
_Franklin._ A strange one indeed! but not more strange than fifty others that come under the
same title. Wherever there is nothing of religion, nothing of reason, nothing of truth, we
come at once to honour; and here we draw the sword, dispense with what little of civilization
we ever pretended to, and murder or get murdered, as may happen. But these ceremonials both begin
and end with an appeal to God, who, before we appealed to Him, plainly told us we should
do no such thing, and that He would punish us most severely if we did. And yet, my lord, even
the gentlemen upon your bench turn a deaf ear to Him on these occasions: nay, they go further;
they pray to Him for success in that which He has forbidden so strictly, and when they have
broken His commandment, thank Him. Upon seeing these mockeries and impieties age after age
repeated, I have asked myself whether the depositaries and expounders
of religion have really any whatever of their own; or rather, like
the lawyers, whether they do not defend professionally a cause that
otherwise does not interest them in the least.

This is an atom: 
Surely, if these holy men really believed in a just retributive God, they would never dare to
utter the word _war_, without horror and deprecation.
_Shipley._ Let us attribute to infirmity what we must else attribute
to wickedness.
_Franklin._ Willingly would I: but children are whipped severely
for inobservance of things less evident, for disobedience of commands
less audible and less awful. I am loath to attribute cruelty to
your order: men so entirely at their ease have seldom any. Certain
I am that several of the bishops would not have patted Cain upon
the back while he was about to kill Abel; and my wonder is that the
very same holy men encourage their brothers in England to kill their
brothers in America; not one, not two nor three, but thousands,
many thousands.
_Shipley._ I am grieved at the blindness with which God has afflicted
us for our sins. These unhappy men are little aware what combustibles
they are storing under the Church, and how soon they may explode.
Even the wisest do not reflect on the most important and the most
certain of things; which is, that every act of inhumanity and
injustice goes far beyond what is apparent at the time of its
commission; that these, and all other things, have their consequences;
and that the consequences are infinite and eternal. If this one
truth alone could be deeply impressed upon the hearts of men, it
would regenerate the whole human race.
_Franklin._ In regard to politics, I am not quite certain whether
a politician may not be too far-sighted: but I am quite certain
that, if it be a fault, it is one into which few have fallen.
The policy of the Romans in the time of the republic, seems to have
been prospective. Some of the Dutch also, and of the Venetians,
used the telescope. But in monarchies the prince, not the people,
is consulted by the minister of the day; and what pleases the weakest
supersedes what is approved by the wisest.
_Shipley._ We have had great statesmen: Burleigh, Cromwell,
Marlborough, Somers: and whatever may have been in the eyes of a
moralist the vices of Walpole, none ever understood more perfectly,
or pursued more steadily, the direct and palpable interests of the
country. Since his administration, our affairs have never been
managed by men of business; and it was more than could have been
expected that, in our war against the French in Canada, the appointment
fell on an able commander.
_Franklin._ Such an anomaly is unlikely to recur. You have in the
English Parliament (I speak of both Houses) only two great men;
only two considerate and clear-sighted politicians; Chatham and
Burke. Three or four can say clever things; several have sonorous
voices; many vibrate sharp comminations from the embrasures of
portentously slit sleeves; and there are those to be found who
deliver their oracles out of wigs as worshipful as the curls of
Jupiter, however they may be grumbled at by the flour-mills they
have laid under such heavy contribution; yet nearly all of all
parties want alike the sagacity to discover that in striking America
you shake Europe; that kings will come out of the war either to be
victims or to be despots; and that within a quarter of a century
they will be hunted down like vermin by the most servile nations,
or slain in their palaces by their own courtiers. In a peace of
twenty years you might have paid off the greater part of your
National Debt, indeed as much of it as it would be expedient to
discharge, and you would have left your old enemy France labouring
and writhing under the intolerable and increasing weight of hers.
This is the only way in which you can ever quite subdue her; and
in this you subdue her without a blow, without a menace, and without
a wrong.
As matters now stand, you are calling her from attending to the
corruptions of her court, and inviting her from bankruptcy to
glory.
_Shipley._ I see not how bankruptcy can be averted by the expenditure
of war.
_Franklin._ It cannot. But war and glory are the same thing to
France, and she sings as shrilly and as gaily after a beating as
before. With a subsidy to a less amount than she has lately been
accustomed to squander in six weeks, and with no more troops than
would garrison a single fortress, she will enable us to set you at
defiance, and to do you a heavier injury in two campaigns than she
has been able to do in two centuries, although your king was in her
pay against you.And as one means of exhibiting his wealth, and so
raising himself up to the level of Mr Donne, he thought that if he could take the latter down
to Abermouth, and show him the place for which, "because his little girls had taken a fancy
to it," he was willing to give the fancy-price of fourteen thousand pounds, he should at last
make those half-shut dreamy eyes open wide, and their owner confess that, in wealth at least,
the Eccleston manufacturer stood on a par with him.

This is an atom: 
All these mingled motives caused the determination which made Ruth sit in the little inn-parlour
at Abermouth during the wild storm's passage.

This is an atom: 
She wondered if she had fulfilled all Mr Bradshaw's directions. She looked at the letter. Yes!
everything was done. And now home with her news, through the wet lane, where the little pools
by the roadside reflected the deep blue sky and the round white clouds with even deeper blue
and clearer white; and the rain-drops hung so thick on the trees, that even a little bird's
flight was enough to shake them down in a bright shower as of rain. When she told the news,
Mary exclaimed,

This is an atom: 
"Oh, how charming! Then we shall see this new member after all!" while Elizabeth added,

This is an atom: 
"Yes! I shall like to do that. But where must we be? Papa will want the dining-room and this
room, and where must we sit?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh!" said Ruth, "in the dressing-room next to my room. All that your papa wants always, is
that you are quiet and out of the way."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXIII

This is an atom: 
Recognition

This is an atom: 
Saturday came. Torn, ragged clouds were driven across the sky. It was not a becoming day for
the scenery, and the little girls regretted it much. First they hoped for a change at twelve
o'clock, and then at the afternoon tide-turning. But at neither time did the sun show his face.

This is an atom: 
"Papa will never buy this dear place," said Elizabeth, sadly, as she watched the weather. "The
sun is everything to it. The sea looks quite leaden to-day, and there is no sparkle on it.
And the sands, that were so yellow and sun-speckled on Thursday, are all one dull brown now."

This is an atom: 
"Never mind! to-morrow may be better," said Ruth, cheerily.

This is an atom: 
"I wonder what time they will come at?" inquired Mary.

This is an atom: 
"Your papa said they would be at the station at five o'clock. And the landlady at the Swan
said it would take them half an hour to get here."

This is an atom: 
"And they are to dine at six?" asked Elizabeth.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," answered Ruth. "And I think if we had our tea half an hour earlier, at half-past four,
and then went out for a walk, we should be nicely out of the way just during the bustle of
the arrival and dinner; and we could be in the drawing-room ready against your papa came in
after dinner."

This is an atom: 
"Oh! that would be nice," said they; and tea was ordered accordingly.

This is an atom: 
The south-westerly wind had dropped, and the clouds were stationary, when they went out on
the sands. They dug little holes near the in-coming tide, and made canals to them from the
water, and blew the light sea-foam against each other; and then stole on tiptoe near to the
groups of grey and white sea-gulls, which despised their caution, flying softly and slowly
away to a little distance as soon as they drew near. And in all this Ruth was as great a child
as any. Only she longed for Leonard with a mother's longing, as indeed she did every day, and
all hours of the day. By-and-by the clouds thickened yet more, and one or two drops of rain
were felt. It was very little, but Ruth feared a shower for her delicate Elizabeth, and besides,
the September evening was fast closing in the dark and sunless day. As they turned homewards
in the rapidly increasing dusk, they saw three figures on the sand near the rocks, coming in
their direction.

This is an atom: 
"Papa and Mr Donne!" exclaimed Mary. "Now we shall see him!"

This is an atom: 
"Which do you make out is him?" asked Elizabeth.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! the tall one, to be sure. Don't you see how papa always turns to him, as if he was speaking
to him and not to the other?"

This is an atom: 
"Who is the other?" asked Elizabeth.

This is an atom: 
"Mr Bradshaw said that Mr Farquhar and Mr Hickson would come with him. But that is not Mr Farquhar,
I am sure," said Ruth.

This is an atom: 
The girls looked at each other, as they always did, when Ruth mentioned Mr Farquhar's name;
but she was perfectly unconscious both of the look and of the conjectures which gave rise to it.

This is an atom: 
As soon as the two parties drew near, Mr Bradshaw called out in his strong voice,

This is an atom: 
"Well, my dears! we found there was an hour before dinner, so we came down upon the sands,
and here you are."

This is an atom: 
The tone of his voice assured them that he was in a bland and indulgent mood, and the two little
girls ran towards him. He kissed them, and shook hands with Ruth; told his companions that
these were the little girls who were tempting him to this extravagance of purchasing Eagle's
Crag; and then, rather doubtfully, and because he saw that Mr Donne expected it, he introduced
"My daughters' governess, Mrs Denbigh."

This is an atom: 
It was growing darker every moment, and it was time they should hasten back to the rocks, which
were even now indistinct in the grey haze. Mr Bradshaw held a hand of each of his daughters,
and Ruth walked alongside, the two strange gentlemen being on the outskirts of the party.

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw began to give his little girls some home news. He told them that Mr Farquhar was
ill, and could not accompany them; but Jemima and their mamma were quite well.

This is an atom: 
The gentleman nearest to Ruth spoke to her.

This is an atom: 
"Are you fond of the sea?" asked he. There was no answer, so he repeated his question in a
different form.

This is an atom: 
"Do you enjoy staying by the seaside? I should rather ask."

This is an atom: 
The reply was "Yes," rather breathed out in a deep inspiration than spoken in a sound. The
sands heaved and trembled beneath Ruth. The figures near her vanished into strange nothingness;
the sounds of their voices were as distant sounds in a dream, while the echo of one voice thrilled
through and through. She could have caught at his arm for support, in the awful dizziness which
wrapped her up, body and soul. That voice! No! if name, and face, and figure were all changed,
that voice was the same which had touched her girlish heart, which had spoken most tender words
of love, which had won, and wrecked her, and which she had last heard in the low mutterings
of fever. She dared not look round to see the figure of him who spoke, dark as it was. She
knew he was there--she heard him speak in the manner in which he used to address strangers
years ago; perhaps she answered him, perhaps she did not--God knew. It seemed as if weights
were tied to her feet--as if the steadfast rocks receded--as if time stood still;--it was so
long, so terrible, that path across the reeling sand.

This is an atom: 
At the foot of the rocks they separated. Mr Bradshaw, afraid lest dinner should cool, preferred
the shorter way for himself and his friends. On Elizabeth's account, the girls were to take
the longer and easier path, which wound upwards through a rocky field, where larks' nests abounded,
and where wild thyme and heather were now throwing out their sweets to the soft night air.

This is an atom: 
The little girls spoke in eager discussion of the strangers. They appealed to Ruth, but Ruth
did not answer, and they were too impatient to convince each other to repeat the question.
The first little ascent from the sands to the field surmounted, Ruth sat down suddenly and
covered her face with her hands. This was so unusual--their wishes, their good, was so invariably
the rule of motion or of rest in their walks--that the girls, suddenly checked, stood silent
and affrighted in surprise. They were still more startled when Ruth wailed aloud some inarticulate
words.

This is an atom: 
"Are you not well, dear Mrs Denbigh?" asked Elizabeth, gently, kneeling down on the grass by Ruth.

This is an atom: 
She sat facing the west. The low watery twilight was on her face as she took her hands away.
So pale, so haggard, so wild and wandering a look the girls had never seen on human countenance
before.

This is an atom: 
"Well! what are you doing here with me? You should not be with me," said she, shaking her head
slowly.

This is an atom: 
They looked at each other.

This is an atom: 
"You are sadly tired," said Elizabeth, soothingly. "Come home, and let me help you to bed.
I will tell papa you are ill, and ask him to send for a doctor."

This is an atom: 
Ruth looked at her as if she did not understand the meaning of her words. No more she did at
first. But by-and-by the dulled brain began to think most vividly and rapidly, and she spoke
in a sharp way which deceived the girls into a belief that nothing had been the matter.

This is an atom: 
"Yes! I was tired. I am tired. Those sands--oh! those sands, those weary, dreadful sands! But
that is all over now. Only my heart aches still. Feel how it flutters and beats," said she,
taking Elizabeth's hand, and holding it to her side. "I am quite well, though," she continued,
reading pity in the child's looks, as she felt the trembling, quivering beat. "We will go straight
to the dressing-room, and read a chapter; that will still my heart; and then I'll go to bed,
and Mr Bradshaw will excuse me, I know, this one night. I only ask for one night. Put on your
right frocks, dears, and do all you ought to do. But I know you will," said she, bending down
to kiss Elizabeth, and then, before she had done so, raising her head abruptly. "You are good
and dear girls--God keep you so!"

This is an atom: 
By a strong effort at self-command, she went onwards at an even pace, neither rushing nor pausing
to sob and think. The very regularity of motion calmed her. The front and back doors of the
house were on two sides, at right angles with each other. They all shrunk a little from the
idea of going in at the front door, now that the strange gentlemen were about, and, accordingly,
they went through the quiet farm-yard right into the bright, ruddy kitchen, where the servants
were dashing about with the dinner things. It was a contrast in more than colour to the lonely,
dusky field, which even the little girls perceived; and the noise, the warmth, the very bustle
of the servants, were a positive relief to Ruth, and for the time lifted off the heavy press
of pent-up passion. A silent house, with moonlit rooms, or with a faint gloom brooding over
the apartments, would have been more to be dreaded. Then, she must have given way, and cried
out. As it was, she went up the old awkward back stairs, and into the room they were to sit
in. There was no candle. Mary volunteered to go down for one; and when she returned she was
full of the wonders of preparation in the drawing-room, and ready and eager to dress, so as
to take her place there before the gentlemen had finished dinner. But she was struck by the
strange paleness of Ruth's face, now that the light fell upon it.

This is an atom: 
"Stay up here, dear Mrs Denbigh! We'll tell papa you are tired, and are gone to bed."

This is an atom: 
Another time Ruth would have dreaded Mr Bradshaw's displeasure; for it was an understood thing
that no one was to be ill or tired in his household without leave asked, and cause given and
assigned. But she never thought of that now. Her great desire was to hold quiet till she was
alone. Quietness it was not--it was rigidity; but she succeeded in being rigid in look and
movement, and went through her duties to Elizabeth (who preferred remaining with her upstairs)
with wooden precision. But her heart felt at times like ice, at times like burning fire; always
a heavy, heavy weight within her. At last Elizabeth went to bed. Still Ruth dared not think.
Mary would come upstairs soon; and with a strange, sick, shrinking yearning, Ruth awaited her--and
the crumbs of intelligence she might drop out about _him_. Ruth's sense of hearing was quickened
to miserable intensity as she stood before the chimney-piece, grasping it tight with both hands--gazing
into the dying fire, but seeing--not the dead grey embers, or the little sparks of vivid light
that ran hither and thither among the wood-ashes--but an old farm-house, and climbing, winding
road, and a little golden breezy common, with a rural inn on the hill-top, far, far away. And
through the thoughts of the past came the sharp sounds of the present--of three voices, one
of which was almost silence, it was so hushed. Indifferent people would only have guessed that
Mr Donne was speaking by the quietness in which the others listened; but Ruth heard the voice
and many of the words, though they conveyed no idea to her mind. She was too much stunned even
to feel curious to know to what they related. _He_ spoke. That was her one fact.

This is an atom: 
Presently up came Mary, bounding, exultant. Papa had let her stay up one quarter of an hour
longer, because Mr Hickson had asked. Mr Hickson was so clever! She did not know what to make
of Mr Donne, he seemed such a dawdle. But he was very handsome. Had Ruth seen him? Oh, no!
She could not, it was so dark on those stupid sands. Well, never mind, she would see him to-morrow.
She _must_ be well to-morrow. Papa seemed a good deal put out that neither she nor Elizabeth
were in the drawing-room to-night; and his last words were, "Tell Mrs Denbigh I hope" (and
papa's "hopes" always meant "expect") "she will be able to make breakfast at nine o'clock;"
and then she would see Mr Donne.

This is an atom: 
That was all Ruth heard about him. She went with Mary into her bedroom, helped her to undress,
and put the candle out. At length she was alone in her own room! At length!

This is an atom: 
But the tension did not give way immediately. She fastened her door, and threw open the window,
cold and threatening as was the night. She tore off her gown; she put her hair back from her
heated face. It seemed now as if she could not think--as if thought and emotion had been repressed
so sternly that they would not come to relieve her stupified brain. Till all at once, like
a flash of lightning, her life, past and present, was revealed to her in its minutest detail.
And when she saw her very present "Now," the strange confusion of agony was too great to be
borne, and she cried aloud. Then she was quite dead, and listened as to the sound of galloping
armies.

This is an atom: 
"If I might see him! If I might see him! If I might just ask him why he left me; if I had vexed
him in any way; it was so strange--so cruel! It was not him; it was his mother," said she,
almost fiercely, as if answering herself. "Oh, God! but he might have found me out before this,"
she continued, sadly. "He did not care for me, as I did for him. He did not care for me at
all," she went on wildly and sharply. "He did me cruel harm. I can never again lift up my face
in innocence. They think I have forgotten all, because I do not speak. Oh, darling love! am
I talking against you?" asked she, tenderly. "I am so torn and perplexed! You, who are the
father of my child!"

This is an atom: 
But that very circumstance, full of such tender meaning in many cases, threw a new light into
her mind. It changed her from the woman into the mother--the stern guardian of her child. She
was still for a time, thinking. Then she began again, but in a low, deep voice,

This is an atom: 
"He left me. He might have been hurried off, but he might have inquired--he might have learnt,
and explained. He left me to bear the burden and the shame; and never cared to learn, as he
might have done, of Leonard's birth. He has no love for his child, and I will have no love
for him."

This is an atom: 
She raised her voice while uttering this determination, and then, feeling her own weakness,
she moaned out, "Alas! alas!"

This is an atom: 
And then she started up, for all this time she had been rocking herself backwards and forwards
as she sat on the ground, and began to pace the room with hurried steps.

This is an atom: 
"What am I thinking of? Where am I? I who have been praying these years and years to be worthy
to be Leonard's mother. My God! what a depth of sin is in my heart! Why, the old time would
be as white as snow to what it would be now, if I sought him out, and prayed for the explanation,
which should re-establish him in my heart. I who have striven (or made a mock of trying) to
learn God's holy will, in order to bring up Leonard into the full strength of a Christian--I
who have taught his sweet innocent lips to pray, 'Lead us not into temptation, but deliver
us from evil;' and yet, somehow, I've been longing to give him to his father, who is--who is--"
she almost choked, till at last she cried sharp out, "Oh, my God! I do believe Leonard's father
is a bad man, and yet, oh! pitiful God, I love him; I cannot forget--I cannot!"

This is an atom: 
She threw her body half out of the window into the cold night air. The wind was rising, and
came in great gusts. The rain beat down on her. It did her good. A still, calm night would
not have soothed her as this did. The wild tattered clouds, hurrying past the moon, gave her
a foolish kind of pleasure that almost made her smile a vacant smile. The blast-driven rain
came on her again, and drenched her hair through and through. The words "stormy wind fulfilling
His word" came into her mind.

This is an atom: 
She sat down on the floor. This time her hands were clasped round her knees. The uneasy rocking
motion was stilled.

This is an atom: 
"I wonder if my darling is frightened with this blustering, noisy wind. I wonder if he is awake."

This is an atom: 
And then her thoughts went back to the various times of old, when, affrighted by the weather--sounds
so mysterious in the night--he had crept into her bed and clung to her, and she had soothed
him, and sweetly awed him into stillness and childlike faith, by telling him of the goodness
and power of God.

This is an atom: 
Of a sudden she crept to a chair, and there knelt as in the very presence of God, hiding her
face, at first not speaking a word (for did He not know her heart), but by-and-by moaning out,
amid her sobs and tears (and now for the first time she wept),

This is an atom: 
"Oh, my God, help me, for I am very weak. My God! I pray Thee be my rock and my strong fortress,
for I of myself am nothing. If I ask in His name, Thou wilt give it me. In the name of Jesus
Christ I pray for strength to do Thy will!"

This is an atom: 
She could not think, or, indeed, remember anything but that she was weak, and God was strong,
and "a very present help in time of trouble;" and the wind rose yet higher, and the house shook
and vibrated as, in measured time, the great and terrible gusts came from the four quarters
of the heavens and blew around it, dying away in the distance with loud and unearthly wails,
which were not utterly still before the sound of the coming blast was heard like the trumpets
of the vanguard of the Prince of Air.

This is an atom: 
There was a knock at the bedroom door--a little, gentle knock, and a soft child's voice.

This is an atom: 
"Mrs Denbigh, may I come in, please? I am so frightened!"

This is an atom: 
It was Elizabeth. Ruth calmed her passionate breathing by one hasty draught of water, and opened
the door to the timid girl.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Mrs Denbigh! did you ever hear such a night? I am so frightened! and Mary sleeps so sound."

This is an atom: 
Ruth was too much shaken to be able to speak all at once; but she took Elizabeth in her arms
to reassure her. Elizabeth stood back.

This is an atom: 
"Why, how wet you are, Mrs Denbigh! and there's the window open, I do believe! Oh, how cold
it is!" said she, shivering.

This is an atom: 
"Get into my bed, dear!" said Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"But do come too! The candle gives such a strange light with that long wick, and, somehow,
your face does not look like you. Please, put the candle out, and come to bed. I am so frightened,
and it seems as if I should be safer if you were by me."

This is an atom: 
Ruth shut the window, and went to bed. Elizabeth was all shivering and quaking. To soothe her,
Ruth made a great effort; and spoke of Leonard and his fears, and, in a low hesitating voice,
she spoke of God's tender mercy, but very humbly, for she feared lest Elizabeth should think
her better and holier than she was. The little girl was soon asleep, her fears forgotten; and
Ruth, worn out by passionate emotion, and obliged to be still for fear of awaking her bedfellow,
went off into a short slumber, through the depths of which the echoes of her waking sobs quivered
up.

This is an atom: 
When she awoke the grey light of autumnal dawn was in the room. Elizabeth slept on; but Ruth
heard the servants about, and the early farmyard sounds. After she had recovered from the shock
of consciousness and recollection, she collected her thoughts with a stern calmness. He was
here. In a few hours she must meet him. There was no escape, except through subterfuges and
contrivances that were both false and cowardly. How it would all turn out she could not say,
or even guess. But of one thing she was clear, and to one thing she would hold fast: that was,
that, come what might, she would obey God's law, and, be the end of all what it might, she
would say, "Thy will be done!" She only asked for strength enough to do this when the time
came. How the time would come--what speech or action would be requisite on her part, she did
not know--she did not even try to conjecture. She left that in His hands.

This is an atom: 
She was icy cold, but very calm, when the breakfast-bell rang. She went down immediately; because
she felt that there was less chance of a recognition if she were already at her place beside
the tea-urn, and busied with the cups, than if she came in after all were settled. Her heart
seemed to stand still, but she felt almost a strange exultant sense of power over herself.
She felt, rather than saw, that he was not there. Mr Bradshaw and Mr Hickson were, and so busy
talking election-politics that they did not interrupt their conversation even when they bowed
to her. Her pupils sat one on each side of her. Before they were quite settled, and while the
other two gentlemen yet hung over the fire, Mr Donne came in. Ruth felt as if that moment was
like death. She had a kind of desire to make some sharp sound, to relieve a choking sensation,
but it was over in an instant, and she sat on very composed and silent--to all outward appearance
the very model of a governess who knew her place. And by-and-by she felt strangely at ease
in her sense of power. She could even listen to what was being said. She had never dared as
yet to look at Mr Donne, though her heart burnt to see him once again. He sounded changed.
The voice had lost its fresh and youthful eagerness of tone, though in peculiarity of modulation
it was the same. It could never be mistaken for the voice of another person. There was a good
deal said at that breakfast, for none seemed inclined to hurry, although it was Sunday morning.
Ruth was compelled to sit there, and it was good for her that she did. That half-hour seemed
to separate the present Mr Donne very effectively from her imagination of what Mr Bellingham
had been. She was no analyser; she hardly even had learnt to notice character; but she felt
there was some strange difference between the people she had lived with lately and the man
who now leant back in his chair, listening in a careless manner to the conversation, but never
joining in, or expressing any interest in it, unless it somewhere, or somehow, touched himself.
Now, Mr Bradshaw always threw himself into a subject; it might be in a pompous, dogmatic sort
of way, but he did do it, whether it related to himself or not; and it was part of Mr Hickson's
trade to assume an interest if he felt it not. But Mr Donne did neither the one nor the other.
When the other two were talking of many of the topics of the day, he put his glass in his eye,
the better to examine into the exact nature of a cold game-pie at the other side of the table.
Suddenly Ruth felt that his attention was caught by her. Until now, seeing his short-sightedness,
she had believed herself safe; now her face flushed with a painful, miserable blush. But in
an instant she was strong and quiet. She looked up straight at his face; and, as if this action
took him aback, he dropped his glass, and began eating away with great diligence. She had seen
him. He was changed, she knew not how. In fact, the expression, which had been only occasional
formerly, when his worse self predominated, had become permanent. He looked restless and dissatisfied.
But he was very handsome still; and her quick eye had recognised, with a sort of strange pride,
that the eyes and mouth were like Leonard's. Although perplexed by the straightforward, brave
look she had sent right at him, he was not entirely baffled. He thought this Mrs Denbigh was
certainly like poor Ruth; but this woman was far handsomer. Her face was positively Greek;
and then such a proud, superb turn of her head; quite queenly! A governess in Mr Bradshaw's
family! Why, she might be a Percy or a Howard for the grandeur of her grace! Poor Ruth! This
woman's hair was darker, though; and she had less colour; altogether a more refined-looking
person. Poor Ruth! and, for the first time for several years, he wondered what had become of
her; though, of course, there was but one thing that could have happened, and perhaps it was
as well he did not know her end, for most likely it would have made him very uncomfortable.
He leant back in his chair, and, unobserved (for he would not have thought it gentlemanly to
look so fixedly at her if she or any one noticed him), he put up his glass again. She was speaking
to one of her pupils, and did not see him.

This is an atom: 
By Jove! it must be she, though! There were little dimples came out about the mouth as she
spoke, just like those he used to admire so much in Ruth, and which he had never seen in any
one else--the sunshine without the positive movement of a smile. The longer he looked the more
he was convinced; and it was with a jerk that he recovered himself enough to answer Mr Bradshaw's
question, whether he wished to go to church or not.

This is an atom: 
"Church? how far--a mile? No; I think I shall perform my devotions at home to-day."

This is an atom: 
He absolutely felt jealous when Mr Hickson sprang up to open the door as Ruth and her pupils
left the room. He was pleased to feel jealous again. He had been really afraid he was too much
"used-up" for such sensations. But Hickson must keep his place. What he was paid for was doing
the talking to the electors, not paying attention to the ladies in their families. Mr Donne
had noticed that Mr Hickson had tried to be gallant to Miss Bradshaw; let him, if he liked;
but let him beware how he behaved to this fair creature, Ruth or no Ruth. It certainly was
Ruth; only how the devil had she played her cards so well as to be the governess--the respected
governess, in such a family as Mr Bradshaw's?

This is an atom: 
Mr Donne's movements were evidently to be the guide of Mr Hickson's. Mr Bradshaw always disliked
going to church, partly from principle, partly because he never could find the places in the
Prayer-book. Mr Donne was in the drawing-room as Mary came down ready equipped; he was turning
over the leaves of the large and handsome Bible. Seeing Mary, he was struck with a new idea.

This is an atom: 
But two persons could explain the matter--a Tunisian guide named Abdul, and a rather mysterious
individual who follows a humble calling in the Rue Ben-Ziad, close
to the Tunis bazaars.

This is an atom: 
This latter is the Princess's personal attendant during her yearly
visit to Tunis.

This is an atom: 
He accompanies her everywhere, may be seen in the hall of her hotel when she is at home, on the
box of her carriage when she drives out, close behind her when she
is walking.

This is an atom: 
He is her shadow in Africa. Only when she goes back to Russia does he return to his profession
in the Rue Ben-Ziad.

This is an atom: 
This is the exact history of the accident which befell the Princess
in 1890.

This is an atom: 
In the spring of that year she arrived one night at Tunis.

This is an atom: 
She had not long been married to an honourable man whom she adored.

This is an atom: 
She was rich, pretty, and popular. Yet her life was clouded by a great fear that sometimes
made the darkness of night almost intolerable to her. She dreaded lest the darkness of
blindness should come upon her.

This is an atom: 
Both her mother, now dead, and her grandfather had laboured under this defect. They had been
born with sight, and had become totally blind ere they reached the age of forty. Princess
Danischeff--as we may call her for the purpose of this story--trembled when she thought of their
fate, and that it might be hers. Certain books that she read, certain conversations on the
subject of heredity that she heard in Petersburg society fed her terror. Occasionally, too,
when she stood under a strong light she felt a slight pain in her eyes. She never spoke of
her fear, but she fell into a condition of nervous exhaustion that alarmed her husband and her
physician. The latter recommended foreign travel as a tonic.
The former, who was detained in the capital by political affairs,
reluctantly agreed to a separation from his wife.

This is an atom: 
And thus it came about, that, late one night of spring, the Princess and her companion, the elderly
Countess de Rosnikoff, arrived in Tunis at the close of a tour in Algeria, and put up at the
Hotel Royal.

This is an atom: 
The bazaars of Tunis are among the best that exist in the world of bazaars, and, on the morning
after her arrival, the Princess was anxious to explore them with her companion. But Madame
de Rosnikoff was fatigued by her journey from Constantine.

This is an atom: 
She begged the Princess to go without her, desiring earnestly to be left in her bedroom with a cup
of weak tea and a French novel.
The Princess, therefore, ordered a guide and set forth to the
bazaars.

This is an atom: 
The guide's name was Abdul. He was a talkative young Eastern, and as he turned with the
Princess into the network of tiny alleys that spreads from the Bab-el-bahar to the bazaars, he
poured forth a flood of information about the marvels of his native
city.

This is an atom: 
The Princess listened idly.
That morning she was cruelly pre-occupied.

This is an atom: 
As she stepped out of the hotel into the bright sunshine she had felt a sharp pain in her
eyes, and now, though she held over her head a large green parasol,
the pain continued.

This is an atom: 
She looked at the light and thought of the darkness that might be coming upon her, and the
chatter of Abdul sounded vague in her ears. Presently, however, she was forced to attend to
him, for he asked her a direct question.

This is an atom: 
"To-day they sell jewels by auction near the MosquÃ©e Djama-ez-Zitouna," he said. "Would the
gracious Princess like to see the market of the jewels?"
The Princess put her hand to her eyes and assented in a low voice.

This is an atom: 
Abdul turned out of the sunshine into a narrow alley covered with a wooden roof. It was full of
shadows and of squatting men, who held out brown hands to the Princess as she passed. But she
was staring at the shadows and did not see the merchants of Goblin Market. Leaving this alley
Abdul led her abruptly into a dense crowd of Arabs, who were all
talking, gesticulating, and moving hither and thither, apparently
under the influence of extreme excitement.

This is an atom: 
Many of them held rings, bracelets, or brooches between their fingers, and some extended palms
upon which lay quantities of uncut jewels--turquoises, sapphires, and emeralds. At a little distance
a grave man was noting down something in a book. But the Princess scarcely observed the progress of the
jewel auction.
Her attention had been attracted by an extraordinary figure that stood near her. This was an immensely
tall Arab, dressed in a dingy brown robe, and wearing upon his shaven head, which narrowed almost
to a point at the back, a red fez with a large black tassel. His claw-like hands were covered
with rings and his bony wrists with bracelets. But the attention of the Princess was riveted
by his eyes. They were small and bright, and squinted horribly--so horribly, that it was
impossible to tell at what he was looking. These eyes gave to his face an expression of
diabolic and ruthless vigilance and cunning. He seemed at the same time to be seeing everything
and to be gazing definitely at nothing.

This is an atom: 
"That is Safti, the jewel doctor," murmured Abdul in the ear of the Princess.

This is an atom: 
"A jewel doctor! What is that?" asked the Princess.

This is an atom: 
"When you are sick he cures you with jewels."
"And what can he cure?" said the Princess, still looking at Safti, who was now bargaining
vociferously with a fat Arab for a piece of milk-white jade.

This is an atom: 
"All things. I was sick of a fever that comes with the summer. He gave me a stone crushed to a
powder, and I was well. He saved from death one of the Bey's sons, who was dying from hijada.

This is an atom: 
And then, too, he has a stone in a ring which can preserve sight to him who is going blind."

This is an atom: 
The Princess started violently.

This is an atom: 
"Impossible!" she cried.

This is an atom: 
"It is true," said Abdul. "It is a green stone--like that."
He pointed to an emerald which an Arab was holding up to the light.

This is an atom: 
The Princess put her hand to her eyes. They still ached, and her temples were throbbing
furiously.

This is an atom: 
"I cannot stay here," she said. "It is too hot. But---- tell the jewel doctor that I wish to
visit him. Where does he live?"

This is an atom: 
"In a little street, Rue Ben-Ziad, in a little house. But he is rich." Abdul spread his arms
abroad.

This is an atom: 
"When will the gracious Princess----?"
"This afternoon. At--at four o'clock you will take me."

This is an atom: 
Abdul spoke to Safti, who turned, squinted horribly at the Princess, and salaamed to her with
a curious and contradictory dignity, turning his fingers, covered with jewels, towards the
earth.

This is an atom: 
That afternoon, at four, when the venerable Madame de Rosnikoff was
still drinking her weak tea and reading her French novel, the
Princess and Abdul stood before the low wooden door of the jewel
doctor's house.

This is an atom: 
Abdul struck upon it, and the terrible physician appeared in the dark aperture, looking all
ways with his deformed eyes, which fascinated the Princess. Having ascertained that he could
speak a little broken French, like many of the Tunisian Arabs, she bade Abdul wait outside,
and entered the hovel of the jewel doctor, who shut close the door behind her.

This is an atom: 
The room in which she found herself was dark and scented.

This is an atom: 
Faint light from the street filtered in through an aperture in the
wall, across which was partially drawn a wooden shutter.

This is an atom: 
Round the room ran a divan covered with straw matting, and Safti now conducted the Princess
ceremoniously to this, and handed her a cup of thick coffee, which he took from a brass tray
that was placed upon a stand.

This is an atom: 
As she sipped the coffee and looked at the pointed head and twisted gaze of Safti, the Princess
heard some distant Arab at a street corner singing monotonously a
tuneless song, and the scent, the darkness, the reiterated song,
and the tall, strange creature standing silently before her gave
to her, in their combination, the atmosphere of a dream.

This is an atom: 
She found it difficult to speak, to explain her errand.

This is an atom: 
At length she said: "You are a doctor? You can cure the sick?"
Safti salaamed.

This is an atom: 
"With jewels? Is that possible?"
"Jewels are the only medicine," Safti replied, speaking with sudden volubility. "With the ruby I
cure madness, with the white jade the disease of the hijada, and
with the bloodstone haemorrhage.

This is an atom: 
I have made a man who was ill of fever wear a topaz, and he arose from bed and walked happily
in the street."
"And with an emerald," interrupted the Princess; "have you not preserved sight with an
emerald?

This is an atom: 
They told me so."
Safti's expression suddenly became grim and suspicious.

This is an atom: 
"Who said that?" he asked sharply.

This is an atom: 
"Abdul. Is it true? Can it be true?"

This is an atom: 
Her cheeks were flushed. She spoke almost with violence, laying her hand upon his arm. Safti
seemed to stare hard into the corners of the little room. Perhaps he was really looking at
the Princess.

This is an atom: 
At length he said: "It is true."
"I will give any price you ask for it," said the Princess.

This is an atom: 
"You!" said Safti. "But you--"
Suddenly he lifted his lean hands, took the face of the Princess between them quite gently,
and turned it towards the small window. She had begun to tremble. Holding her soft cheeks with his
brown fingers, Safti remained motionless for a long time, during
which it seemed to the Princess that he was looking away from her
at some distant object.

This is an atom: 
She watched his frightful and surreptitious eyes, that never told the truth, she heard the
distant Arab's everlasting song, and her dream became a nightmare. At last Safti dropped his
hands and said:

This is an atom: 
"It may be that some day you will need my emerald."
The Princess felt as if at that moment a bullet entered her heart.

This is an atom: 
"Give it me--give it me!" she cried. "I am rich. I------"
"I do not sell my medicines," Safti answered. "Those who use them must live near me, here in
Tunis. When they are healed they give back to me the jewel that has saved them. But you--you
live far off."
With the swiftness of a woman the Princess saw that persuasion would be useless. Safti's face
looked hard as brown wood. She seemed to recover from her emotion, and said quietly:

This is an atom: 
"At least you will let me see the emerald?"
Safti went to a small bureau that stood at the back of the room,
opened one of its drawers with a key which he drew from beneath his
dingy robe, lifted a small silver box carefully out, returned to
the Princess, and put the box into her hand.

This is an atom: 
"Open it," he said.

This is an atom: 
She obeyed, and took out a very small and antique gold ring, in which was set a rather dull
emerald. Safti drew it gently from her, and put it upon the forefinger of her left hand.
It was so tiny that it would not pass beyond the joint of the finger, and it looked ugly
and odd upon the Princess, who wore many beautiful rings. Now that she saw it she felt the
superstition that had sprung from her terror dying within her. Safti, with his crooked eyes,
must have read her thought in her face, for he said:

This is an atom: 
"The Princess is wrong. That medicine could cure her. The one who wears it for three months
in each year can never be blind."
Taking the emerald from her finger, he touched her two eyes with it, and it seemed to the
Princess that, as he did so, the pain she felt in them withdrew. Her desire for the jewel
instantly returned.

This is an atom: 
"Let me wear it," she said, putting forth all her charm to soften the jewel doctor. "Let me
take it with me to Russia. I will make you rich."
Safti shook his head.

This is an atom: 
"The Princess may wear it here, in Tunis," he replied. "Not elsewhere."
She began to temporise, hoping to conquer his resistance later.

This is an atom: 
"I may take it with me now?" she asked.

This is an atom: 
"At a fee."

This is an atom: 
"I will pay it."
The jewel doctor went to the door, and called in Abdul. Five minutes later the Princess
passed the singing Arab at the corner of the street, Rue Ben-Ziad. She had signed a paper
pledging herself to return the emerald to Safti at the end of forty-eight hours, and to pay
125 francs for her possession of it during that time. And she wore the emerald on the forefinger
of her left hand.

This is an atom: 
On the following morning Madame de Rosnikoff said to the Princess:

This is an atom: 
"I hate Tunis. It has an evil climate. The tea here is too strong, and I feel sure the drains
are bad. Last night I was feverish. I am always feverish when I am near bad drains."

This is an atom: 
The Princess, who had slept well, and had waked with no pain in her eyes, answered these
complaints cheerily, made the Countess some tea that was really weak, and drove her out in
the sunshine to see Carthage. The Countess did not see it, because there is no longer a
Carthage. She went to bed that night in a bad humour, and again complained of drains the next
morning. This time the Princess did not heed her, for she was thinking of the hour when she
must return the emerald to Safti.

This is an atom: 
"What an ugly ring that is," said the old Countess. "Where did you get it? It is too small.
Why do you wear it?"

This is an atom: 
"I--I bought it in the bazaars," answered the Princess.

This is an atom: 
"My dear, you wasted your money," said the companion; and she went to bed with another French
novel.

This is an atom: 
That afternoon the Princess implored Safti to sell her the emerald, and as he persistently
declined she renewed her lease of it for another forty-eight hours. As she left the jewel
doctor's home she did not notice that he spoke some words in a low and eager voice to Abdul,
pointing towards her as he did so. Nor did she see the strange bustle of varied life in the
street as she walked slowly under the great Moorish arch of the Porte de France. She was deeply
thoughtful.

This is an atom: 
Since she had worn the ugly ring of Safti she had suffered no pain from her eyes, and a strange
certainty had gradually come upon her that, while the emerald was in her possession, she
would be safe from the terrible disease of which she had so long lived in terror. Yet Safti
would not let her have the ring.

This is an atom: 
And she could not live for ever in Tunis.

This is an atom: 
Already she had prolonged her stay abroad, and was due in Russia,
where her anxious husband awaited her.

This is an atom: 
She knew not what to do. Suddenly an idea occurred to her.

This is an atom: 
It made her flush red and tingle with shame.
She glanced up, and saw the lustrous eyes of Abdul fixed intently upon her. As he left her
at the door of the hotel he said,
"The Princess will stay long in Tunis?"

This is an atom: 
"Another week at least, Abdul," she answered carelessly. "You can go home now. I shall not want
you any more to-day."
And she walked into the hotel without looking at him again. When she was in her room she sent
for a list of the steamers sailing daily from Tunis for the different
ports of Africa and Europe.
Presently she came to the bedside of Madame de Rosnikoff.
"Countess," she said, "you are no better?"
"How can I be? The drains are bad, and the tea here is too strong."

This is an atom: 
"There is a boat that leaves for Sicily at midnight--for Marsala.
Shall we go in her?" 
The old lady bounded on her pillow.
"Straight on by Italy to Russia?" she cried joyfully.
The Princess nodded. A fierce excitement shone in her pretty eyes,
and her little hands were trembling as she looked down at the dull
emerald of Safti.

This is an atom: 
*****
At eleven o'clock that night the Princess and the Countess got into
a carriage, drove to the edge of the huge salt lake by which Tunis
lies and went on board the Stella d'Italia.
The sky was starless. The winds were still, and it was very dark.
As the ship glided out from the shore the old Countess hurried
below. But the Princess remained on deck, leaning upon the bulwark,
and gazing at the fading lights of the city where Safti dwelt. Two
flames seemed burning in her heart, a fierce flame of joy, a fierce
flame of contempt--of contempt for herself. For was she not a common
thief? She looked at Safti's ring on her finger, and flushed scarlet
in the darkness. Yet she was joyful, triumphant, as she heard the
beating of the ship's heart, and saw the lights of Tunis growing
fainter in the distance, and felt the onward movement of the _Stella
d'Italia_ through the night. She felt herself nearer to Russia with
each throb of the machinery. And from Russia she would expiate her
sin. From Russia she would compensate Safti for his loss. The lights
of Tunis grew fainter. She thought of the open sea.
But suddenly she felt that the ship was slowing down. The engines
beat more feebly, then ceased to beat. The ship glided on for a
moment in silence, and stopped. A cold fear ran over the Princess.
She called to a sailor.
"Why," she said, "why do we stop? Is anything wrong?"
He pointed to some lights on the port side.
"We are off Hammam-Lif, madame," he said. "We are going to lie to
for half-an-hour to take in cargo."
To the Princess that half-hour seemed all eternity. She remained
upon deck, and whenever she heard the splash of oars as a boat drew
near, or the guttural sound of an Arab voice, she trembled, and,
staring into the blackness, fancied that she saw the tall figure,
the pointed head, and the deformed eyes of the jewel doctor. But
the minutes passed. The cargo was all got on board.
The boats drew off. And once again the ship shuddered as the heart
of her began to beat, and the ebon water ran backward from her
prow.
Then the Princess was glad. She laid the hand on which shone Safti's
emerald upon the bulwark, and gazed towards the sea, turning her
back upon the lights of Hammam-Lif. She thought of safety, of Russia.
She did not hear a soft step drawing near upon the deck behind her.
She did not see the flash of steel descending to the bulwark on
which her hand was laid.
But suddenly the horrible cry of a woman in agony rang through the
night. It was instantly succeeded by a splash in the water, as a
tall figure dived over the vessel's side.
When the sun rose on the following day over the minarets of Tunis
the _Stella d'ltalia_, with the Princess on board, was far out at
sea.
The emerald of Safti was once more in the little house in the Rue
Ben-Ziad.

This is an atom: 
It was still upon the Princess's finger.Ruth sat with her head drooping, more from exhaustion after a season of effort than because
she shunned Mr Donne's looks. He had so lost his power over her--his power, which had stirred
her so deeply the night before--that, except as one knowing her error and her shame, and making
a cruel use of such knowledge, she had quite separated him from the idol of her youth. And
yet, for the sake of that first and only love, she would gladly have known what explanation
he could offer to account for leaving her. It would have been something gained to her own self-respect,
if she had learnt that he was not then, as she felt him to be now, cold and egotistical, caring
for no one and nothing but what related to himself.

This is an atom: 
Home, and Leonard--how strangely peaceful the two seemed! Oh, for the rest that a dream about
Leonard would bring!

This is an atom: 
Mary and Elizabeth went to bed immediately after prayers, and Ruth accompanied them. It was
planned that the gentlemen should leave early the next morning. They were to breakfast half
an hour sooner, to catch the railway train; and this by Mr Donne's own arrangement, who had
been as eager about his canvassing, the week before, as it was possible for him to be, but
who now wished Eccleston and the Dissenting interest therein very fervently at the devil.

This is an atom: 
Just as the carriage came round, Mr Bradshaw turned to Ruth: "Any message for Leonard beyond
love, which is a matter of course?"

This is an atom: 
Ruth gasped--for she saw Mr Donne catch at the name; she did not guess the sudden sharp jealousy
called out by the idea that Leonard was a grown-up man.

This is an atom: 
"Who is Leonard?" said he to the little girl standing by him; he did not know which she was.

This is an atom: 
"Mrs Denbigh's little boy," answered Mary.

This is an atom: 
Under some pretence or other, he drew near to Ruth; and in that low voice, which she had learnt
to loathe, he said,

This is an atom: 
"Our child!"

This is an atom: 
By the white misery that turned her face to stone--by the wild terror in her imploring eyes--by
the gasping breath which came out as the carriage drove away--he knew that he had seized the
spell to make her listen at last.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXIV

This is an atom: 
The Meeting on the Sands

This is an atom: 
"He will take him away from me! He will take the child from me!"

This is an atom: 
These words rang like a tolling bell through Ruth's head. It seemed to her that her doom was
certain. Leonard would be taken from her! She had a firm conviction--not the less firm because
she knew not on what it was based--that a child, whether legitimate or not, belonged of legal
right to the father. And Leonard, of all children, was the prince and monarch. Every man's
heart would long to call Leonard "Child!" She had been too strongly taxed to have much power
left her to reason coolly and dispassionately, just then, even if she had been with any one
who could furnish her with information from which to draw correct conclusions. The one thought
haunted her night and day--"He will take my child away from me!" In her dreams she saw Leonard
borne away into some dim land, to which she could not follow. Sometimes he sat in a swiftly-moving
carriage, at his father's side, and smiled on her as he passed by, as if going to promised
pleasure. At another time he was struggling to return to her; stretching out his little arms,
and crying to her for the help she could not give. How she got through the days, she did not
know; her body moved about and habitually acted, but her spirit was with her child. She thought
often of writing and warning Mr Benson of Leonard's danger; but then she shrank from recurring
to circumstances, all mention of which had ceased years ago; the very recollection of which
seemed buried deep for ever. Besides, she feared occasioning discord or commotion in the quiet
circle in which she lived. Mr Benson's deep anger against her betrayer had been shown too clearly
in the old time to allow her to think that he would keep it down without expression now. He
would cease to do anything to forward his election; he would oppose him as much as he could;
and Mr Bradshaw would be angry, and a storm would arise, from the bare thought of which Ruth
shrank with the cowardliness of a person thoroughly worn out with late contest. She was bodily
wearied with her spiritual buffeting.

This is an atom: 
One morning, three or four days after their departure, she received a letter from Miss Benson.
She could not open it at first, and put it on one side, clenching her hand over it all the
time. At last she tore it open. Leonard was safe as yet. There were a few lines in his great
round hand, speaking of events no larger than the loss of a beautiful "alley." There was a
sheet from Miss Benson. She always wrote letters in the manner of a diary. "Monday we did so-and-so;
Tuesday, so-and-so, &c." Ruth glanced rapidly down the page. Yes, here it was! Sick, fluttering
heart, be still!

This is an atom: 
"In the middle of the damsons, when they were just on the fire, there was a knock at the door.
My brother was out, and Sally was washing up, and I was stirring the preserve with my great
apron and bib on; so I bade Leonard come in from the garden and open the door. But I would
have washed his face first, if I had known who it was! It was Mr Bradshaw and the Mr Donne
that they hope to send up to the House of Commons, as member of Parliament for Eccleston, and
another gentleman, whose name I never heard. They had come canvassing; and when they found
my brother was out, they asked Leonard if they could see me. The child said, 'Yes! if I could
leave the damsons;' and straightway came to call me, leaving them standing in the passage.
I whipped off my apron, and took Leonard by the hand, for I fancied I should feel less awkward
if he was with me; and then I went and asked them all into the study, for I thought I should
like them to see how many books Thurstan had got. Then they began talking politics at me in
a very polite manner, only I could not make head or tail of what they meant; and Mr Donne took
a deal of notice of Leonard, and called him to him; and I am sure he noticed what a noble,
handsome boy he was, though his face was very brown and red, and hot with digging, and his
curls all tangled. Leonard talked back as if he had known him all his life, till, I think,
Mr Bradshaw thought he was making too much noise, and bid him remember he ought to be seen,
not heard. So he stood as still and stiff as a soldier, close to Mr Donne; and as I could not
help looking at the two, and thinking how handsome they both were in their different ways,
I could not tell Thurstan half the messages the gentlemen left for him. But there was one thing
more I must tell you, though I said I would not. When Mr Donne was talking to Leonard, he took
off his watch and chain and put it round the boy's neck, who was pleased enough, you may be
sure. I bade him give it back to the gentleman, when they were all going away; and I was quite
surprised, and very uncomfortable, when Mr Donne said he had given it to Leonard, and that
he was to keep it for his own. I could see Mr Bradshaw was annoyed, and he and the other gentleman
spoke to Mr Donne, and I heard them say, 'too barefaced;' and I shall never forget Mr Donne's
proud, stubborn look back at them, nor his way of saying, 'I allow no one to interfere with
what I choose to do with my own.' And he looked so haughty and displeased, I durst say nothing
at the time. But when I told Thurstan, he was very grieved and angry; and said he had heard
that our party were bribing, but that he never could have thought they would have tried to
do it at his house. Thurstan is very much out of spirits about this election altogether; and,
indeed, it does make sad work up and down the town. However, he sent back the watch with a
letter to Mr Bradshaw; and Leonard was very good about it, so I gave him a taste of the new
damson-preserve on his bread for supper."

This is an atom: 
Although a stranger might have considered this letter wearisome from the multiplicity of the
details, Ruth craved greedily after more. What had Mr Donne said to Leonard? Had Leonard liked
his new acquaintance? Were they likely to meet again? After wondering and wondering over these
points, Ruth composed herself by the hope that in a day or two she should hear again; and to
secure this end, she answered the letters by return of post. That was on Thursday. On Friday
she had another letter, in a strange hand. It was from Mr Donne. No name, no initials were
given. If it had fallen into another person's hands, they could not have recognised the writer,
nor guessed to whom it was sent. It contained simply these words:

This is an atom: 
"For our child's sake, and in his name, I summon you to appoint a place where I can speak,
and you can listen, undisturbed. The time must be on Sunday; the limit of distance may be the
circumference of your power of walking. My words may be commands, but my fond heart entreats.
More I shall not say now, but, remember! your boy's welfare depends on your acceding to this
request. Address B. D., Post-Office, Eccleston."

This is an atom: 
Ruth did not attempt to answer this letter till the last five minutes before the post went
out. She could not decide until forced to it. Either way she dreaded. She was very nearly leaving
the letter altogether unanswered. But suddenly she resolved she would know all, the best, the
worst. No cowardly dread of herself, or of others, should make her neglect aught that came
to her in her child's name. She took up a pen and wrote:

This is an atom: 
"The sands below the rocks, where we met you the other night. Time, afternoon church."

This is an atom: 
Sunday came.

This is an atom: 
"I shall not go to church this afternoon. You know the way, of course; and I can trust you
to go steadily by yourselves."

This is an atom: 
When they came to kiss her before leaving her, according to their fond wont, they were struck
by the coldness of her face and lips.

This is an atom: 
"Are you not well, dear Mrs Denbigh? How cold you are!"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, darling! I am well;" and tears sprang into her eyes as she looked at their anxious little
faces. "Go now, dears. Five o'clock will soon be here, and then we will have tea."

This is an atom: 
"And that will warm you!" said they, leaving the room.

This is an atom: 
"And then it will be over," she murmured--"over."

This is an atom: 
It never came into her head to watch the girls as they disappeared down the lane on their way
to church. She knew them too well to distrust their doing what they were told. She sat still,
her head bowed on her arms for a few minutes, and then rose up and went to put on her walking
things. Some thoughts impelled her to sudden haste. She crossed the field by the side of the
house, ran down the steep and rocky path, and was carried by the impetus of her descent far
out on the level sands--but not far enough for her intent. Without looking to the right hand
or to the left, where comers might be seen, she went forwards to the black posts, which, rising
above the heaving waters, marked where the fishermen's nets were laid. She went straight towards
this place, and hardly stinted her pace even where the wet sands were glittering with the receding
waves. Once there, she turned round, and in a darting glance, saw that as yet no one was near.
She was perhaps half-a-mile or more from the grey, silvery rocks, which sloped away into brown
moorland, interspersed with a field here and there of golden, waving corn. Behind were purple
hills, with sharp, clear outlines, touching the sky. A little on one side from where she stood,
she saw the white cottages and houses which formed the village of Abermouth, scattered up and
down, and, on a windy hill, about a mile inland, she saw the little grey church, where even
now many were worshipping in peace.

This is an atom: 
"Pray for me!" she sighed out, as this object caught her eye.

This is an atom: 
And now, close under the heathery fields, where they fell softly down and touched the sands,
she saw a figure moving in the direction of the great shadow made by the rocks--going towards
the very point where the path from Eagle's Crag came down to the shore.

This is an atom: 
"It is he!" said she to herself. And she turned round and looked seaward. The tide had turned;
the waves were slowly receding, as if loath to lose the hold they had, so lately, and with
such swift bounds, gained on the yellow sands. The eternal moan they have made since the world
began filled the ear, broken only by the skirl of the grey sea-birds as they alighted in groups
on the edge of the waters, or as they rose up with their measured, balancing motion, and the
sunlight caught their white breasts. There was no sign of human life to be seen; no boat, or
distant sail, or near shrimper. The black posts there were all that spoke of men's work or
labour. Beyond a stretch of the waters, a few pale grey hills showed like films; their summits
clear, though faint, their bases lost in a vapoury mist.

This is an atom: 
On the hard, echoing sands, and distinct from the ceaseless murmur of the salt sea waves, came
footsteps--nearer--nearer. Very near they were when Ruth, unwilling to show the fear that rioted
in her heart, turned round, and faced Mr Donne.

This is an atom: 
He came forward, with both hands extended.

This is an atom: 
"This is kind! my own Ruth," said he. Ruth's arms hung down motionless at her sides.

This is an atom: 
"What! Ruth, have you no word for me?"

This is an atom: 
"I have nothing to say," said Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"Why, you little revengeful creature! And so I am to explain all before you will even treat
me with decent civility."

This is an atom: 
"I do not want explanations," said Ruth, in a trembling tone. "We must not speak of the past.
You asked me to come in Leonard's--in my child's name, and to hear what you had to say about him."

This is an atom: 
"But what I have to say about him relates to you even more. And how can we talk about him without
recurring to the past? That past, which you try to ignore--I know you cannot do it in your
heart--is full of happy recollections to me. Were you not happy in Wales?" he said, in his
tenderest tone.

This is an atom: 
But there was no answer; not even one faint sigh, though he listened intently.

This is an atom: 
"You dare not speak; you dare not answer me. Your heart will not allow you to prevaricate,
and you know you were happy."

This is an atom: 
Suddenly Ruth's beautiful eyes were raised to him, full of lucid splendour, but grave and serious
in their expression; and her cheeks, heretofore so faintly tinged with the tenderest blush,
flashed into a ruddy glow.

This is an atom: 
"I was happy. I do not deny it. Whatever comes, I will not blench from the truth. I have answered
you."

This is an atom: 
"And yet," replied he, secretly exulting in her admission, and not perceiving the inner strength
of which she must have been conscious before she would have dared to make it--"and yet, Ruth,
we are not to recur to the past! Why not? If it was happy at the time, is the recollection
of it so miserable to you?"

This is an atom: 
He tried once more to take her hand, but she quietly stepped back.

This is an atom: 
"I came to hear what you had to say about my child," said she, beginning to feel very weary.

This is an atom: 
"_Our_ child, Ruth."

This is an atom: 
She drew herself up, and her face went very pale.

This is an atom: 
"What have you to say about him?" asked she, coldly.

This is an atom: 
"Much," exclaimed he--"much that may affect his whole life. But it all depends upon whether
you will hear me or not."

This is an atom: 
"I listen."

This is an atom: 
"Good Heavens! Ruth, you will drive me mad. Oh! what a changed person you are from the sweet,
loving creature you were! I wish you were not so beautiful." She did not reply, but he caught
a deep, involuntary sigh.

This is an atom: 
"Will you hear me if I speak, though I may not begin all at once to talk of this boy--a boy
of whom any mother--any parent, might be proud? I could see that, Ruth. I have seen him; he
looked like a prince in that cramped, miserable house, and with no earthly advantages. It is
a shame he should not have every kind of opportunity laid open before him."

This is an atom: 
There was no sign of maternal ambition on the motionless face, though there might be some little
spring in her heart, as it beat quick and strong at the idea of the proposal she imagined he
was going to make of taking her boy away to give him the careful education she had often craved
for him. She should refuse it, as she would everything else which seemed to imply that she
acknowledged a claim over Leonard; but yet sometimes, for her boy's sake, she had longed for
a larger opening--a more extended sphere.

This is an atom: 
"Ruth! you acknowledge we were happy once;--there were circumstances which, if I could tell
you them all in detail, would show you how in my weak, convalescent state I was almost passive
in the hands of others. Ah, Ruth! I have not forgotten the tender nurse who soothed me in my
delirium. When I am feverish, I dream that I am again at Llan-dhu, in the little old bed-chamber,
and you, in white--which you always wore then, you know--flitting about me."

This is an atom: 
The tears dropped, large and round, from Ruth's eyes--she could not help it--how could she?

This is an atom: 
"We were happy then," continued he, gaining confidence from the sight of her melted mood, and
recurring once more to the admission which he considered so much in his favour. "Can such happiness
never return?" Thus he went on, quickly, anxious to lay before her all he had to offer, before
she should fully understand his meaning.

This is an atom: 
"If you would consent, Leonard should be always with you--educated where and how you liked--money
to any amount you might choose to name should be secured to you and him--if only, Ruth--if
only those happy days might return."

This is an atom: 
Ruth spoke.

This is an atom: 
"I said that I was happy, because I had asked God to protect and help me--and I dared not tell
a lie. I was happy. Oh! what is happiness or misery that we should talk about them now?"

This is an atom: 
Mr Donne looked at her, as she uttered these words, to see if she was wandering in her mind,
they seemed to him so utterly strange and incoherent.

This is an atom: 
"I dare not think of happiness--I must not look forward to sorrow. God did not put me here
to consider either of these things."

This is an atom: 
"My dear Ruth, compose yourself! There is no hurry in answering the question I asked."

This is an atom: 
"What was it?" said Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"I love you so, I cannot live without you. I offer you my heart, my life--I offer to place
Leonard wherever you would have him placed. I have the power and the means to advance him in
any path of life you choose. All who have shown kindness to you shall be rewarded by me, with
a gratitude even surpassing your own. If there is anything else I can do that you can suggest,
I will do it."

This is an atom: 
"Listen to me!" said Ruth, now that the idea of what he proposed had entered her mind. "When
I said that I was happy with you long ago, I was choked with shame as I said it. And yet it
may be a vain, false excuse that I make for myself. I was very young; I did not know how such
a life was against God's pure and holy will--at least, not as I know it now; and I tell you
truth--all the days of my years since I have gone about with a stain on my hidden soul--a stain
which made me loathe myself, and envy those who stood spotless and undefiled; which made me
shrink from my child--from Mr Benson, from his sister, from the innocent girls whom I teach--nay,
even I have cowered away from God Himself; and what I did wrong then, I did blindly to what
I should do now if I listened to you."

This is an atom: 
She was so strongly agitated that she put her hands over her face, and sobbed without restraint.
Then, taking them away, she looked at him with a glowing face, and beautiful, honest, wet eyes,
and tried to speak calmly, as she asked if she needed to stay longer (she would have gone away
at once but that she thought of Leonard, and wished to hear all that his father might have
to say). He was so struck anew by her beauty, and understood her so little, that he believed
that she only required a little more urging to consent to what he wished; for in all she had
said there was no trace of the anger and resentment for his desertion of her, which he had
expected would be a prominent feature--the greatest obstacle he had to encounter. The deep
sense of penitence she expressed, he mistook for earthly shame; which he imagined he could
soon soothe away.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, I have much more to say. I have not said half. I cannot tell you how fondly I will--how
fondly I do love you--how my life shall be spent in ministering to your wishes. Money, I see--I
know, you despise--"

This is an atom: 
"Mr Bellingham! I will not stay to hear you speak to me so again. I have been sinful, but it
is not you who should--" She could not speak, she was so choking with passionate sorrow.

This is an atom: 
He wanted to calm her, as he saw her shaken with repressed sobs. He put his hand on her arm.
She shook it off impatiently, and moved away in an instant.

This is an atom: 
"Ruth!" said he, nettled by her action of repugnance, "I begin to think you never loved me."

This is an atom: 
"I!--I never loved you! Do you dare to say so?"

This is an atom: 
Her eyes flamed on him as she spoke. Her red, round lip curled into beautiful contempt.

This is an atom: 
"Why do you shrink so from me?" said he, in his turn getting impatient.

This is an atom: 
"I did not come here to be spoken to in this way," said she. "I came, if by any chance I could
do Leonard good. I would submit to many humiliations for his sake--but to no more from you."

This is an atom: 
"Are not you afraid to brave me so?" said he. "Don't you know how much you are in my power?"

This is an atom: 
She was silent. She longed to go away, but dreaded lest he should follow her, where she might
be less subject to interruption than she was here--near the fisherman's nets, which the receding
tide was leaving every moment barer and more bare, and the posts they were fastened to more
blackly uprising above the waters.

This is an atom: 
Mr Donne put his hands on her arms as they hung down before her--her hands tightly clasped
together.

This is an atom: 
"Ask me to let you go," said he. "I will, if you will ask me." He looked very fierce and passionate
and determined. The vehemence of his action took Ruth by surprise, and the painful tightness
of the grasp almost made her exclaim. But she was quite still and mute.

This is an atom: 
"Ask me," said he, giving her a little shake. She did not speak. Her eyes, fixed on the distant
shore, were slowly filling with tears. Suddenly a light came through the mist that obscured
them, and the shut lips parted. She saw some distant object that gave her hope.

This is an atom: 
"It is Stephen Bromley," said she. "He is coming to his nets. They say he is a very desperate,
violent man, but he will protect me."

This is an atom: 
"You obstinate, wilful creature!" said Mr Donne, releasing his grasp. "You forget that one
word of mine could undeceive all these good people at Eccleston; and that if I spoke out ever
so little, they would throw you off in an instant. Now!" he continued, "do you understand how
much you are in my power?"

This is an atom: 
"Mr and Miss Benson know all--they have not thrown me off," Ruth gasped out. "Oh! for Leonard's
sake! you would not be so cruel."

This is an atom: 
"Then do not you be cruel to him--to me. Think once more!"

This is an atom: 
"I think once more;" she spoke solemnly. "To save Leonard from the shame and agony of knowing
my disgrace, I would lie down and die. Oh! perhaps it would be best for him--for me, if I might;
my death would be a stingless grief--but to go back into sin would be the real cruelty to him.
The errors of my youth may be washed away by my tears--it was so once when the gentle, blessed
Christ was upon earth; but now, if I went into wilful guilt, as you would have me, how could
I teach Leonard God's holy will? I should not mind his knowing my past sin, compared to the
awful corruption it would be if he knew me living now, as you would have me, lost to all fear
of God--" Her speech was broken by sobs. "Whatever may be my doom--God is just--I leave myself
in His hands. I will save Leonard from evil. Evil would it be for him if I lived with you.
I will let him die first!" She lifted her eyes to heaven, and clasped and wreathed her hands
together tight. Then she said: "You have humbled me enough, sir. I shall leave you now."

This is an atom: 
She turned away resolutely. The dark, grey fisherman was at hand. Mr Donne folded his arms,
and set his teeth, and looked after her.

This is an atom: 
"What a stately step she has! How majestic and graceful all her attitudes were! She thinks
she has baffled me now. We will try something more, and bid a higher price." He unfolded his
arms, and began to follow her. He gained upon her, for her beautiful walk was now wavering
and unsteady. The works which had kept her in motion were running down fast.

This is an atom: 
"Ruth!" said he, overtaking her. "You shall hear me once more. Aye, look round! Your fisherman
is near. He may hear me, if he chooses--hear your triumph. I am come to offer to marry you,
Ruth; come what may, I will have you. Nay--I will make you hear me. I will hold this hand till
you have heard me. To-morrow I will speak to any one in Eccleston you like--to Mr Bradshaw;
Mr ----, the little minister, I mean. We can make it worth while for him to keep our secret,
and no one else need know but what you are really Mrs Denbigh. Leonard shall still bear this
name, but in all things else he shall be treated as my son. He and you would grace any situation.
I will take care the highest paths are open to him!"

This is an atom: 
He looked to see the lovely face brighten into sudden joy; on the contrary, the head was still
hung down with a heavy droop.

This is an atom: 
"I cannot," said she; her voice was very faint and low.

This is an atom: 
"It is sudden for you, my dearest. But be calm. It will all be easily managed. Leave it to me."

This is an atom: 
"I cannot," repeated she, more distinct and clear, though still very low.

This is an atom: 
"Why! what on earth makes you say that?" asked he, in a mood to be irritated by any repetition
of such words.

This is an atom: 
"I do not love you. I did once. Don't say I did not love you then; but I do not now. I could
never love you again. All you have said and done since you came with Mr Bradshaw to Abermouth
first, has only made me wonder how I ever could have loved you. We are very far apart. The
time that has pressed down my life like brands of hot iron, and scarred me for ever, has been
nothing to you. You have talked of it with no sound of moaning in your voice--no shadow over
the brightness of your face; it has left no sense of sin on your conscience, while me it haunts
and haunts; and yet I might plead that I was an ignorant child--only I will not plead anything,
for God knows all-- But this is only one piece of our great difference--"

This is an atom: 
"You mean that I am no saint," he said, impatient at her speech. "Granted. But people who are
no saints have made very good husbands before now. Come, don't let any morbid, overstrained
conscientiousness interfere with substantial happiness--happiness both to you and to me--for
I am sure I can make you happy--aye! and make you love me, too, in spite of your pretty defiance.
I love you so dearly I must win love back. And here are advantages for Leonard, to be gained
by you quite in a holy and legitimate way."

This is an atom: 
She stood very erect.

This is an atom: 
"If there was one thing needed to confirm me, you have named it. You shall have nothing to
do with my boy, by my consent, much less by my agency. I would rather see him working on the
roadside than leading such a life--being such a one as you are. You have heard my mind now,
Mr Bellingham. You have humbled me--you have baited me; and if at last I have spoken out too
harshly, and too much in a spirit of judgment, the fault is yours. If there were no other reason
to prevent our marriage but the one fact that it would bring Leonard into contact with you,
that would be enough."

This is an atom: 
"It is enough!" said he, making her a low bow. "Neither you nor your child shall ever more
be annoyed by me. I wish you a good evening."

This is an atom: 
They walked apart--he back to the inn, to set off instantly, while the blood was hot within
him, from the place where he had been so mortified--she to steady herself along till she reached
the little path, more like a rude staircase than anything else, by which she had to climb to
the house.

This is an atom: 
She did not turn round for some time after she was fairly lost to the sight of any one on the
shore; she clambered on, almost stunned by the rapid beating of her heart. Her eyes were hot
and dry; and at last became as if she were suddenly blind. Unable to go on, she tottered into
the tangled underwood which grew among the stones, filling every niche and crevice, and little
shelving space, with green and delicate tracery. She sank down behind a great overhanging rock,
which hid her from any one coming up the path. An ash-tree was rooted in this rock, slanting
away from the sea-breezes that were prevalent in most weathers; but this was a still, autumnal
Sabbath evening. As Ruth's limbs fell, so they lay. She had no strength, no power of volition
to move a finger. She could not think or remember. She was literally stunned. The first sharp
sensation which roused her from her torpor was a quick desire to see him once more; up she
sprang, and climbed to an out-jutting dizzy point of rock, but a little above her sheltered
nook, yet commanding a wide view over the bare, naked sands;--far away below, touching the
rippling water-line, was Stephen Bromley, busily gathering in his nets; besides him there was
no living creature visible. Ruth shaded her eyes, as if she thought they might have deceived
her; but no, there was no one there. She went slowly down to her old place, crying sadly as
she went.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! if I had not spoken so angrily to him--the last things I said were so bitter--so reproachful!--and
I shall never, never see him again!"

This is an atom: 
She could not take in the general view and scope of their conversation--the event was too near
her for that; but her heart felt sore at the echo of her last words, just and true as their
severity was. Her struggle, her constant flowing tears, which fell from very weakness, made
her experience a sensation of intense bodily fatigue; and her soul had lost the power of throwing
itself forward, or contemplating anything beyond the dreary present, when the expanse of grey,
wild, bleak moors, stretching wide away below a sunless sky, seemed only an outward sign of
the waste world within her heart, for which she could claim no sympathy;--for she could not
even define what its woes were; and if she could, no one would understand how the present time
was haunted by the terrible ghost of the former love.

This is an atom: 
"I am so weary! I am so weary!" she moaned aloud at last. "I wonder if I might stop here, and
just die away."

This is an atom: 
She shut her eyes, until through the closed lids came a ruddy blaze of light. The clouds had
parted away, and the sun was going down in a crimson glory behind the distant purple hills.
The whole western sky was one flame of fire. Ruth forgot herself in looking at the gorgeous
sight. She sat up gazing, and, as she gazed, the tears dried on her cheeks; and, somehow, all
human care and sorrow were swallowed up in the unconscious sense of God's infinity. The sunset
calmed her more than any words, however wise and tender, could have done. It even seemed to
give her strength and courage; she did not know how or why, but so it was.

This is an atom: 
She rose, and went slowly towards home. Her limbs were very stiff, and every now and then she
had to choke down an unbidden sob. Her pupils had been long returned from church, and had busied
themselves in preparing tea--an occupation which had probably made them feel the time less long.

This is an atom: 
If they had ever seen a sleep-walker, they might have likened Ruth to one for the next few
days, so slow and measured did her movements seem--so far away was her intelligence from all
that was passing around her--so hushed and strange were the tones of her voice. They had letters
from home announcing the triumphant return of Mr Donne as M.P. for Eccleston. Mrs Denbigh heard
the news without a word, and was too languid to join in the search after purple and yellow
flowers with which to deck the sitting-room at Eagle's Crag.

This is an atom: 
A letter from Jemima came the next day, summoning them home. Mr Donne and his friends had left
the place, and quiet was restored in the Bradshaw household; so it was time that Mary's and
Elizabeth's holiday should cease. Mrs Denbigh had also a letter--a letter from Miss Benson,
saying that Leonard was not quite well. There was so much pains taken to disguise anxiety,
that it was very evident much anxiety was felt; and the girls were almost alarmed by Ruth's
sudden change from taciturn langour to eager, vehement energy. Body and mind seemed strained
to exertion. Every plan that could facilitate packing and winding-up affairs at Abermouth,
every errand and arrangement that could expedite their departure by one minute, was done by
Ruth with stern promptitude. She spared herself in nothing. She made them rest, made them lie
down, while she herself lifted weights and transacted business with feverish power, never resting,
and trying never to have time to think.

This is an atom: 
For in remembrance of the Past there was Remorse,--how had she forgotten Leonard these last
few days!--how had she repined and been dull of heart to her blessing! And in anticipation
of the Future there was one sharp point of red light in the darkness which pierced her brain
with agony, and which she would not see or recognise--and saw and recognised all the more for
such mad determination--which is not the true shield against the bitterness of the arrows of Death.

This is an atom: 
When the seaside party arrived in Eccleston, they were met by Mrs and Miss Bradshaw and Mr
Benson. By a firm resolution, Ruth kept from shaping the question, "Is he alive?" as if by
giving shape to her fears she made their realisation more imminent. She said merely, "How is
he?" but she said it with drawn, tight, bloodless lips, and in her eyes Mr Benson read her
anguish of anxiety.

This is an atom: 
"He is very ill, but we hope he will soon be better. It is what every child has to go through."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXV

This is an atom: 
Jemima Makes a Discovery

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw had been successful in carrying his point. His member had been returned; his proud
opponents mortified. So the public thought he ought to be well pleased; but the public were
disappointed to see that he did not show any of the gratification they supposed him to feel.

This is an atom: 
The truth was, that he had met with so many small mortifications during the progress of the
election, that the pleasure which he would otherwise have felt in the final success of his
scheme was much diminished.

This is an atom: 
He had more than tacitly sanctioned bribery; and now that the excitement was over, he regretted
it; not entirely from conscientious motives, though he was uneasy from a slight sense of wrong-doing;
but he was more pained, after all, to think that, in the eyes of some of his townsmen, his
hitherto spotless character had received a blemish. He, who had been so stern and severe a
censor on the undue influence exercised by the opposite party in all preceding elections, could
not expect to be spared by their adherents now, when there were rumours that the hands of the
scrupulous Dissenters were not clean. Before, it had been his boast that neither friend nor
enemy could say one word against him; now, he was constantly afraid of an indictment for bribery,
and of being compelled to appear before a Committee to swear to his own share in the business.

This is an atom: 
His uneasy, fearful consciousness made him stricter and sterner than ever; as if he would quench
all wondering, slanderous talk about him in the town by a renewed austerity of uprightness;
that the slack-principled Mr Bradshaw of one month of ferment and excitement might not be confounded
with the highly-conscientious and deeply-religious Mr Bradshaw, who went to chapel twice a
day, and gave a hundred pounds a-piece to every charity in the town, as a sort of thank-offering
that his end was gained.

This is an atom: 
But he was secretly dissatisfied with Mr Donne. In general, that gentleman had been rather
too willing to act in accordance with any one's advice, no matter whose; as if he had thought
it too much trouble to weigh the wisdom of his friends, in which case Mr Bradshaw's would have,
doubtless, proved the most valuable. But now and then he unexpectedly, and utterly without
reason, took the conduct of affairs into his own hands, as when he had been absent without
leave only just before the day of nomination. No one guessed whither he had gone; but the fact
of his being gone was enough to chagrin Mr Bradshaw, who was quite ready to pick a quarrel
on this very head, if the election had not terminated favourably. As it was, he had a feeling
of proprietorship in Mr Donne which was not disagreeable. He had given the new M.P. his seat;
his resolution, his promptitude, his energy, had made Mr Donne "our member;" and Mr Bradshaw
began to feel proud of him accordingly. But there had been no one circumstance during this
period to bind Jemima and Mr Farquhar together. They were still misunderstanding each other
with all their power. The difference in the result was this: Jemima loved him all the more,
in spite of quarrels and coolness. He was growing utterly weary of the petulant temper of which
he was never certain; of the reception which varied day after day, according to the mood she
was in and the thoughts that were uppermost; and he was almost startled to find how very glad
he was that the little girls and Mrs Denbigh were coming home. His was a character to bask
in peace; and lovely, quiet Ruth, with her low tones and quiet replies, her delicate waving
movements, appeared to him the very type of what a woman should be--a calm, serene soul, fashioning
the body to angelic grace.

This is an atom: 
It was, therefore, with no slight interest that Mr Farquhar inquired daily after the health
of little Leonard. He asked at the Bensons' house; and Sally answered him, with swollen and
tearful eyes, that the child was very bad--very bad indeed. He asked at the doctor's; and the
doctor told him, in a few short words, that "it was only a bad kind of measles, and that the
lad might have a struggle for it, but he thought he would get through. Vigorous children carried
their force into everything; never did things by halves; if they were ill, they were sure to
be in a high fever directly; if they were well, there was no peace in the house for their rioting.
For his part," continued the doctor, "he thought he was glad he had had no children; as far
as he could judge, they were pretty much all plague and no profit." But as he ended his speech
he sighed; and Mr Farquhar was none the less convinced that common report was true, which represented
the clever, prosperous surgeon of Eccleston as bitterly disappointed at his failure of offspring.

This is an atom: 
While these various interests and feelings had their course outside the Chapel-house, within
there was but one thought which possessed all the inmates. When Sally was not cooking for the
little invalid, she was crying; for she had had a dream about green rushes, not three months
ago, which, by some queer process of oneiromancy she interpreted to mean the death of a child;
and all Miss Benson's endeavours were directed to making her keep silence to Ruth about this
dream. Sally thought that the mother ought to be told; what were dreams sent for but for warnings?
But it was just like a pack of Dissenters, who would not believe anything like other folks.
Miss Benson was too much accustomed to Sally's contempt for Dissenters, as viewed from the
pinnacle of the Establishment, to pay much attention to all this grumbling; especially as Sally
was willing to take as much trouble about Leonard as if she believed he was going to live,
and that his recovery depended upon her care. Miss Benson's great object was to keep her from
having any confidential talks with Ruth; as if any repetition of the dream could have deepened
the conviction in Ruth's mind that the child would die.

This is an atom: 
It seemed to her that his death would only be the fitting punishment for the state of indifference
towards him--towards life and death--towards all things earthly or divine, into which she had
suffered herself to fall since her last interview with Mr Donne. She did not understand that
such exhaustion is but the natural consequence of violent agitation and severe tension of feeling.
The only relief she experienced was in constantly serving Leonard; she had almost an animal's
jealousy lest any one should come between her and her young. Mr Benson saw this jealous suspicion,
although he could hardly understand it; but he calmed his sister's wonder and officious kindness,
so that the two patiently and quietly provided all that Ruth might want, but did not interfere
with her right to nurse Leonard. But when he was recovering, Mr Benson, with the slight tone
of authority he knew how to assume when need was, bade Ruth lie down and take some rest, while
his sister watched. Ruth did not answer, but obeyed in a dull, weary kind of surprise at being
so commanded. She lay down by her child, gazing her fill at his calm slumber; and as she gazed,
her large white eyelids were softly pressed down as with a gentle irresistible weight, and
she fell asleep.

This is an atom: 
She dreamed that she was once more on the lonely shore, striving to carry Leonard away from
some pursuer--some human pursuer--she knew he was human, and she knew who he was, although
she dared not say his name even to herself, he seemed so close and present, gaining on her
flying footsteps, rushing after her as with the sound of the roaring tide. Her feet seemed
heavy weights fixed to the ground; they would not move. All at once, just near the shore, a
great black whirlwind of waves clutched her back to her pursuer; she threw Leonard on to land,
which was safety; but whether he reached it or no, or was swept back like her into a mysterious
something too dreadful to be borne, she did not know, for the terror awakened her. At first
the dream seemed yet a reality, and she thought that the pursuer was couched even there, in
that very room, and the great boom of the sea was still in her ears. But as full consciousness
returned, she saw herself safe in the dear old room--the haven of rest--the shelter from storms.
A bright fire was glowing in the little old-fashioned, cup-shaped grate, niched into a corner
of the wall, and guarded on either side by whitewashed bricks, which rested on hobs. On one
of these the kettle hummed and buzzed, within two points of boiling whenever she or Leonard
required tea. In her dream that home-like sound had been the roaring of the relentless sea,
creeping swiftly on to seize its prey. Miss Benson sat by the fire, motionless and still; it
was too dark to read any longer without a candle; but yet on the ceiling and upper part of
the walls the golden light of the setting sun was slowly moving--so slow, and yet a motion
gives the feeling of rest to the weary yet more than perfect stillness. The old clock on the
staircase told its monotonous click-clack, in that soothing way which more marked the quiet
of the house than disturbed with any sense of sound. Leonard still slept that renovating slumber,
almost in her arms, far from that fatal pursuing sea, with its human form of cruelty. The dream
was a vision; the reality which prompted the dream was over and past--Leonard was safe--she
was safe; all this loosened the frozen springs, and they gushed forth in her heart, and her
lips moved in accordance with her thoughts.

This is an atom: 
"What were you saying, my darling?" said Miss Benson, who caught sight of the motion, and fancied
she was asking for something. Miss Benson bent over the side of the bed on which Ruth lay,
to catch the low tones of her voice.

This is an atom: 
"I only said," replied Ruth, timidly, "thank God! I have so much to thank Him for, you don't know."

This is an atom: 
"My dear, I am sure we have all of us cause to be thankful that our boy is spared. See! he
is wakening up; and we will have a cup of tea together."

This is an atom: 
Leonard strode on to perfect health; but he was made older in character and looks by his severe
illness. He grew tall and thin, and the lovely child was lost in the handsome boy. He began
to wonder, and to question. Ruth mourned a little over the vanished babyhood, when she was
all in all, and over the childhood, whose petals had fallen away; it seemed as though two of
her children were gone--the one an infant, the other a bright, thoughtless darling; and she
wished that they could have remained quick in her memory for ever, instead of being absorbed
in loving pride for the present boy. But these were only fanciful regrets, flitting like shadows
across a mirror. Peace and thankfulness were once more the atmosphere of her mind; nor was
her unconsciousness disturbed by any suspicion of Mr Farquhar's increasing approbation and
admiration, which he was diligently nursing up into love for her. She knew that he had sent--she
did not know how often he had brought--fruit for the convalescent Leonard. She heard, on her
return from her daily employment, that Mr Farquhar had brought a little gentle pony on which
Leonard, weak as he was, might ride. To confess the truth, her maternal pride was such that
she thought that all kindness shown to such a boy as Leonard was but natural; she believed
him to be

This is an atom: 
A child whom all that looked on, loved.

This is an atom: 
As in truth he was; and the proof of this was daily shown in many kind inquiries, and many
thoughtful little offerings, besides Mr Farquhar's. The poor (warm and kind of heart to all
sorrow common to humanity) were touched with pity for the young widow, whose only child lay
ill, and nigh unto death. They brought what they could--a fresh egg, when eggs were scarce--a
few ripe pears that grew on the sunniest side of the humblest cottage, where the fruit was
regarded as a source of income--a call of inquiry, and a prayer that God would spare the child,
from an old crippled woman, who could scarcely drag herself so far as the Chapel-house, yet
felt her worn and weary heart stirred with a sharp pang of sympathy, and a very present remembrance
of the time when she too was young, and saw the life-breath quiver out of her child, now an
angel in that heaven which felt more like home to the desolate old creature than this empty
earth. To all such, when Leonard was better, Ruth went, and thanked them from her heart. She
and the old cripple sat hand in hand over the scanty fire on the hearth of the latter, while
she told in solemn, broken, homely words, how her child sickened and died. Tears fell like
rain down Ruth's cheeks; but those of the old woman were dry. All tears had been wept out of
her long ago, and now she sat patient and quiet, waiting for death. But after this, Ruth "clave
unto her," and the two were henceforward a pair of friends. Mr Farquhar was only included in
the general gratitude which she felt towards all who had been kind to her boy.

This is an atom: 
The winter passed away in deep peace after the storms of the autumn, yet every now and then
a feeling of insecurity made Ruth shake for an instant. Those wild autumnal storms had torn
aside the quiet flowers and herbage that had gathered over the wreck of her early life, and
shown her that all deeds, however hidden and long passed by, have their eternal consequences.
She turned sick and faint whenever Mr Donne's name was casually mentioned. No one saw it; but
she felt the miserable stop in her heart's beating, and wished that she could prevent it by
any exercise of self-command. She had never named his identity with Mr Bellingham, nor had
she spoken about the seaside interview. Deep shame made her silent and reserved on all her
life before Leonard's birth; from that time she rose again in her self-respect, and spoke as
openly as a child (when need was) of all occurrences which had taken place since then; except
that she could not, and would not, tell of this mocking echo, this haunting phantom, this past,
that would not rest in its grave. The very circumstance that it was stalking abroad in the
world, and might reappear at any moment, made her a coward: she trembled away from contemplating
what the reality had been; only she clung more faithfully than before to the thought of the
great God, who was a rock in the dreary land, where no shadow was.

This is an atom: 
Autumn and winter, with their lowering skies, were less dreary than the woeful, desolate feelings
that shed a gloom on Jemima. She found too late that she had considered Mr Farquhar so securely
her own for so long a time, that her heart refused to recognise him as lost to her, unless
her reason went through the same weary, convincing, miserable evidence day after day, and hour
after hour. He never spoke to her now, except from common civility. He never cared for her
contradictions; he never tried, with patient perseverance, to bring her over to his opinions;
he never used the wonted wiles (so tenderly remembered now they had no existence but in memory)
to bring her round out of some wilful mood--and such moods were common enough now! Frequently
she was sullenly indifferent to the feelings of others--not from any unkindness, but because
her heart seemed numb and stony, and incapable of sympathy. Then afterwards her self-reproach
was terrible--in the dead of night, when no one saw it. With a strange perversity, the only
intelligence she cared to hear, the only sights she cared to see, were the circumstances which
gave confirmation to the idea that Mr Farquhar was thinking of Ruth for a wife. She craved
with stinging curiosity to hear something of their affairs every day; partly because the torture
which such intelligence gave was almost a relief from the deadness of her heart to all other
interests.

This is an atom: 
And so spring (_gioventu dell'anno_) came back to her, bringing all the contrasts which spring
alone can bring to add to the heaviness of the soul. The little winged creatures filled the
air with bursts of joy; the vegetation came bright and hopefully onwards, without any check
of nipping frost. The ash-trees in the Bradshaws' garden were out in leaf by the middle of
May, which that year wore more the aspect of summer than most Junes do. The sunny weather mocked
Jemima, and the unusual warmth oppressed her physical powers. She felt very weak and languid;
she was acutely sensible that no one else noticed her want of strength; father, mother, all
seemed too full of other things to care if, as she believed, her life was waning. She herself
felt glad that it was so. But her delicacy was not unnoticed by all. Her mother often anxiously
asked her husband if he did not think Jemima was looking ill; nor did his affirmation to the
contrary satisfy her, as most of his affirmations did. She thought every morning, before she
got up, how she could tempt Jemima to eat, by ordering some favourite dainty for dinner; in
many other little ways she tried to minister to her child; but the poor girl's own abrupt irritability
of temper had made her mother afraid of openly speaking to her about her health.

This is an atom: 
Ruth, too, saw that Jemima was not looking well. How she had become an object of dislike to
her former friend she did not know; but she was sensible that Miss Bradshaw disliked her now.
She was not aware that this feeling was growing and strengthening almost into repugnance, for
she seldom saw Jemima out of school-hours, and then only for a minute or two. But the evil
element of a fellow-creature's dislike oppressed the atmosphere of her life. That fellow-creature
was one who had once loved her so fondly, and whom she still loved, although she had learnt
to fear her, as we fear those whose faces cloud over when we come in sight--who cast unloving
glances at us, of which we, though not seeing, are conscious, as of some occult influence;
and the cause of whose dislike is unknown to us, though every word and action seems to increase
it. I believe that this sort of dislike is only shown by the jealous, and that it renders the
disliker even more miserable, because more continually conscious than the object; but the growing
evidence of Jemima's feeling made Ruth very unhappy at times. This very May, too, an idea had
come into her mind, which she had tried to repress--namely, that Mr Farquhar was in love with
her. It annoyed her extremely; it made her reproach herself that she ever should think such
a thing possible. She tried to strangle the notion, to drown it, to starve it out by neglect--its
existence caused her such pain and distress.

This is an atom: 
The worst was, he had won Leonard's heart, who was constantly seeking him out; or, when absent,
talking about him. The best was some journey connected with business, which would take him
to the Continent for several weeks; and, during that time, surely this disagreeable fancy of
his would die away, if untrue; and if true, some way would be opened by which she might put
a stop to all increase of predilection on his part, and yet retain him as a friend for Leonard--that
darling for whom she was far-seeing and covetous, and miserly of every scrap of love and kindly
regard.

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar would not have been flattered if he had known how much his departure contributed
to Ruth's rest of mind on the Saturday afternoon on which he set out on his journey. It was
a beautiful day; the sky of that intense quivering blue which seemed as though you could look
through it for ever, yet not reach the black, infinite space which is suggested as lying beyond.
Now and then a thin, torn, vaporous cloud floated slowly within the vaulted depth; but the
soft air that gently wafted it was not perceptible among the leaves on the trees, which did
not even tremble. Ruth sat at her work in the shadow formed by the old grey garden wall; Miss
Benson and Sally--the one in the parlour window-seat mending stockings, the other hard at work
in her kitchen--were both within talking distance, for it was weather for open doors and windows;
but none of the three kept up any continued conversation; and in the intervals Ruth sang low
a brooding song, such as she remembered her mother singing long ago. Now and then she stopped
to look at Leonard, who was labouring away with vehement energy at digging over a small plot
of ground, where he meant to prick out some celery plants that had been given to him. Ruth's
heart warmed at the earnest, spirited way in which he thrust his large spade deep down into
the brown soil, his ruddy face glowing, his curly hair wet with the exertion; and yet she sighed
to think that the days were over when her deeds of skill could give him pleasure. Now, his
delight was in acting himself; last year, not fourteen months ago, he had watched her making
a daisy-chain for him, as if he could not admire her cleverness enough; this year--this week,
when she had been devoting every spare hour to the simple tailoring which she performed for
her boy (she had always made every article he wore, and felt almost jealous of the employment),
he had come to her with a wistful look, and asked when he might begin to have clothes made
by a man?

This is an atom: 
Ever since the Wednesday when she had accompanied Mary and Elizabeth, at Mrs Bradshaw's desire,
to be measured for spring clothes by the new Eccleston dressmaker, she had been looking forward
to this Saturday afternoon's pleasure of making summer trousers for Leonard; but the satisfaction
of the employment was a little taken away by Leonard's speech. It was a sign, however, that
her life was very quiet and peaceful, that she had leisure to think upon the thing at all;
and often she forgot it entirely in her low, chanting song, or in listening to the thrush warbling
out his afternoon ditty to his patient mate in the holly-bush below.

This is an atom: 
The distant rumble of carts through the busy streets (it was market-day) not only formed a
low rolling bass to the nearer and pleasanter sounds, but enhanced the sense of peace by the
suggestion of the contrast afforded to the repose of the garden by the bustle not far off.

This is an atom: 
But besides physical din and bustle, there is mental strife and turmoil.

This is an atom: 
That afternoon, as Jemima was restlessly wandering about the house, her mother desired her
to go on an errand to Mrs Pearson's, the new dressmaker, in order to give some directions about
her sisters' new frocks. Jemima went, rather than have the trouble of resisting; or else she
would have preferred staying at home, moving or being outwardly quiet according to her own
fitful will. Mrs Bradshaw, who, as I have said, had been aware for some time that something
was wrong with her daughter, and was very anxious to set it to rights if she only knew how,
had rather planned this errand with a view to dispel Jemima's melancholy.

This is an atom: 
"And, Mimie, dear," said her mother, "when you are there, look out for a new bonnet for yourself;
she has got some very pretty ones, and your old one is so shabby."

This is an atom: 
"It does for me, mother," said Jemima, heavily. "I don't want a new bonnet."

This is an atom: 
"But I want you to have one, my lassie. I want my girl to look well and nice."

This is an atom: 
There was something of homely tenderness in Mrs Bradshaw's tone that touched Jemima's heart.
She went to her mother, and kissed her with more of affection than she had shown to any one
for weeks before; and the kiss was returned with warm fondness.

This is an atom: 
"I think you love me, mother," said Jemima.

This is an atom: 
"We all love you, dear, if you would but think so. And if you want anything, or wish for anything,
only tell me, and with a little patience I can get your father to give it you, I know. Only
be happy, there's a good girl."

This is an atom: 
"Be happy! as if one could by an effort of will!" thought Jemima, as she went along the street,
too absorbed in herself to notice the bows of acquaintances and friends, but instinctively
guiding herself right among the throng and press of carts, and gigs, and market people in High
Street.

This is an atom: 
But her mother's tones and looks, with their comforting power, remained longer in her recollection
than the inconsistency of any words spoken. When she had completed her errand about the frocks,
she asked to look at some bonnets, in order to show her recognition of her mother's kind thought.

This is an atom: 
Mrs Pearson was a smart, clever-looking woman of five or six and thirty. She had all the variety
of small-talk at her finger-ends that was formerly needed by barbers to amuse the people who
came to be shaved. She had admired the town till Jemima was weary of its praises, sick and
oppressed by its sameness, as she had been these many weeks.

This is an atom: 
"Here are some bonnets, ma'am, that will be just the thing for you--elegant and tasty, yet
quite of the simple style, suitable to young ladies. Oblige me by trying on this white silk!"

This is an atom: 
Jemima looked at herself in the glass; she was obliged to own it was very becoming, and perhaps
not the less so for the flush of modest shame which came into her cheeks as she heard Mrs Pearson's
open praises of the "rich, beautiful hair," and the "Oriental eyes" of the wearer.

This is an atom: 
"I induced the young lady who accompanied your sisters the other day--the governess, is she,
ma'am?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes--Mrs Denbigh is her name," said Jemima, clouding over.

This is an atom: 
"Thank you, ma'am. Well, I persuaded Mrs Denbigh to try on that bonnet, and you can't think
how charming she looked in it; and yet I don't think it became her as much as it does you."

This is an atom: 
"Mrs Denbigh is very beautiful," said Jemima, taking off the bonnet, and not much inclined
to try on any other.

This is an atom: 
"Very, ma'am. Quite a peculiar style of beauty. If I might be allowed, I should say that hers
was a Grecian style of loveliness, while yours was Oriental. She reminded me of a young person
I once knew in Fordham." Mrs Pearson sighed an audible sigh.

This is an atom: 
"In Fordham!" said Jemima, remembering that Ruth had once spoken of the place as one in which
she had spent some time, while the county in which it was situated was the same in which Ruth
was born. "In Fordham! Why, I think Mrs Denbigh comes from that neighbourhood."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, ma'am! she cannot be the young person I mean--I am sure, ma'am--holding the position she
does in your establishment. I should hardly say I knew her myself; for I only saw her two or
three times at my sister's house; but she was so remarked for her beauty, that I remember her
face quite well--the more so, on account of her vicious conduct afterwards."

This is an atom: 
"Her vicious conduct!" repeated Jemima, convinced by these words that there could be no identity
between Ruth and the "young person" alluded to. "Then it could not have been our Mrs Denbigh."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, no, ma'am! I am sure I should be sorry to be understood to have suggested anything of
the kind. I beg your pardon if I did so. All I meant to say--and perhaps that was a liberty
I ought not to have taken, considering what Ruth Hilton was--"

This is an atom: 
"Ruth Hilton!" said Jemima, turning suddenly round, and facing Mrs Pearson.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, ma'am, that was the name of the young person I allude to."

This is an atom: 
"Tell me about her--what did she do?" asked Jemima, subduing her eagerness of tone and look
as best she might, but trembling as on the verge of some strange discovery.

This is an atom: 
"I don't know whether I ought to tell you, ma'am--it is hardly a fit story for a young lady;
but this Ruth Hilton was an apprentice to my sister-in-law, who had a first-rate business in
Fordham, which brought her a good deal of patronage from the county families; and this young
creature was very artful and bold, and thought sadly too much of her beauty; and, somehow,
she beguiled a young gentleman, who took her into keeping (I am sure, ma'am, I ought to apologise
for polluting your ears--)"

This is an atom: 
"Go on," said Jemima, breathlessly.

This is an atom: 
"I don't know much more. His mother followed him into Wales. She was a lady of a great deal
of religion, and of a very old family, and was much shocked at her son's misfortune in being
captivated by such a person; but she led him to repentance, and took him to Paris, where, I
think, she died; but I am not sure, for, owing to family differences, I have not been on terms
for some years with my sister-in-law, who was my informant."

This is an atom: 
"Who died?" interrupted Jemima--"the young man's mother, or--or Ruth Hilton?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh dear, ma'am! pray don't confuse the two. It was the mother, Mrs-- I forget the name--something
like Billington. It was the lady who died."

This is an atom: 
"And what became of the other?" asked Jemima, unable, as her dark suspicion seemed thickening,
to speak the name.

This is an atom: 
"The girl? Why, ma'am, what could become of her? Not that I know exactly--only one knows they
can but go from bad to worse, poor creatures! God forgive me, if I am speaking too transiently
of such degraded women, who, after all, are a disgrace to our sex."

This is an atom: 
"Then you know nothing more about her?" asked Jemima.

This is an atom: 
"I did hear that she had gone off with another gentleman that she met with in Wales, but I'm
sure I can't tell who told me."

This is an atom: 
There was a little pause. Jemima was pondering on all she had heard. Suddenly she felt that
Mrs Pearson's eyes were upon her, watching her; not with curiosity, but with a newly-awakened
intelligence;--and yet she must ask one more question; but she tried to ask it in an indifferent,
careless tone, handling the bonnet while she spoke.

This is an atom: 
"How long is it since all this--all you have been telling me about--happened?" (Leonard was
eight years old.)

This is an atom: 
"Why--let me see. It was before I was married, and I was married three years, and poor dear
Pearson has been deceased five--I should say going on for nine years this summer. Blush roses
would become your complexion, perhaps, better than these lilacs," said she, as with superficial
observation she watched Jemima turning the bonnet round and round on her hand--the bonnet that
her dizzy eyes did not see.

This is an atom: 
"Thank you. It is very pretty. But I don't want a bonnet. I beg your pardon for taking up your
time." And with an abrupt bow to the discomfited Mrs Pearson, she was out and away in the open
air, threading her way with instinctive energy along the crowded street. Suddenly she turned
round, and went back to Mrs Pearson's with even more rapidity than she had been walking away
from the house.

This is an atom: 
"I have changed my mind," said she, as she came, breathless, up into the show-room. "I will
take the bonnet. How much is it?"

This is an atom: 
"Allow me to change the flowers; it can be done in an instant, and then you can see if you
would not prefer the roses; but with either foliage it is a lovely little bonnet," said Mrs
Pearson, holding it up admiringly on her hand.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! never mind the flowers--yes! change them to roses." And she stood by, agitated (Mrs Pearson
thought with impatience), all the time the milliner was making the alteration with skilful,
busy haste.

This is an atom: 
"By the way," said Jemima, when she saw the last touches were being given, and that she must
not delay executing the purpose which was the real cause of her return--"Papa, I am sure, would
not like your connecting Mrs Denbigh's name with such a--story as you have been telling me."

This is an atom: 
"Oh dear! ma'am, I have too much respect for you all to think of doing such a thing! Of course
I know, ma'am, that it is not to be cast up to any lady that she is like anybody disreputable."

This is an atom: 
"But I would rather you did not name the likeness to any one," said Jemima; "not to any one.
Don't tell any one the story you have told me this morning."

This is an atom: 
"Indeed, ma'am, I should never think of such a thing! My poor husband could have borne witness
that I am as close as the grave where there is anything to conceal."

This is an atom: 
"Oh dear!" said Jemima, "Mrs Pearson, there is nothing to conceal; only you must not speak
about it."

This is an atom: 
"I certainly shall not do it, ma'am; you may rest assured of me."

This is an atom: 
This time Jemima did not go towards home, but in the direction of the outskirts of the town,
on the hilly side. She had some dim recollection of hearing her sisters ask if they might not
go and invite Leonard and his mother to tea; and how could she face Ruth, after the conviction
had taken possession of her heart that she, and the sinful creature she had just heard of,
were one and the same?

This is an atom: 
It was yet only the middle of the afternoon; the hours were early in the old-fashioned town
of Eccleston. Soft white clouds had come slowly sailing up out of the west; the plain was flecked
with thin floating shadows, gently borne along by the westerly wind that was waving the long
grass in the hay-fields into alternate light and shade. Jemima went into one of these fields,
lying by the side of the upland road. She was stunned by the shock she had received. The diver,
leaving the green sward, smooth and known, where his friends stand with their familiar smiling
faces, admiring his glad bravery--the diver, down in an instant in the horrid depths of the
sea, close to some strange, ghastly, lidless-eyed monster, can hardly more feel his blood curdle
at the near terror than did Jemima now. Two hours ago--but a point of time on her mind's dial--she
had never imagined that she should ever come in contact with any one who had committed open
sin; she had never shaped her conviction into words and sentences, but still it was _there_,
that all the respectable, all the family and religious circumstances of her life, would hedge
her in, and guard her from ever encountering the great shock of coming face to face with vice.
Without being pharisaical in her estimation of herself, she had all a Pharisee's dread of publicans
and sinners, and all a child's cowardliness--that cowardliness which prompts it to shut its
eyes against the object of terror, rather than acknowledge its existence with brave faith.
Her father's often reiterated speeches had not been without their effect. He drew a clear line
of partition, which separated mankind into two great groups, to one of which, by the grace
of God, he and his belonged; while the other was composed of those whom it was his duty to
try and reform, and bring the whole force of his morality to bear upon, with lectures, admonitions,
and exhortations--a duty to be performed, because it was a duty--but with very little of that
Hope and Faith which is the Spirit that maketh alive. Jemima had rebelled against these hard
doctrines of her father's, but their frequent repetition had had its effect, and led her to
look upon those who had gone astray with shrinking, shuddering recoil, instead of with a pity
so Christ-like as to have both wisdom and tenderness in it.

This is an atom: 
And now she saw among her own familiar associates one, almost her housefellow, who had been
stained with that evil most repugnant to her womanly modesty, that would fain have ignored
its existence altogether. She loathed the thought of meeting Ruth again. She wished that she
could take her up, and put her down at a distance somewhere--anywhere--where she might never
see or hear of her more; never be reminded, as she must be whenever she saw her, that such
things were in this sunny, bright, lark-singing earth, over which the blue dome of heaven bent
softly down as Jemima sat in the hayfield that June afternoon; her cheeks flushed and red,
but her lips pale and compressed, and her eyes full of a heavy, angry sorrow. It was Saturday,
and the people in that part of the country left their work an hour earlier on that day. By
this, Jemima knew it must be growing time for her to be at home. She had had so much of conflict
in her own mind of late, that she had grown to dislike struggle, or speech, or explanation;
and so strove to conform to times and hours much more than she had done in happier days. But
oh! how full of hate her heart was growing against the world! And oh! how she sickened at the
thought of seeing Ruth! Who was to be trusted more, if Ruth--calm, modest, delicate, dignified
Ruth--had a memory blackened by sin?

This is an atom: 
As she went heavily along, the thought of Mr Farquhar came into her mind. It showed how terrible
had been the stun, that he had been forgotten until now. With the thought of him came in her
first merciful feeling towards Ruth. This would never have been, had there been the least latent
suspicion in Jemima's jealous mind that Ruth had purposely done aught--looked a look--uttered
a word--modulated a tone--for the sake of attracting. As Jemima recalled all the passages of
their intercourse, she slowly confessed to herself how pure and simple had been all Ruth's
ways in relation to Mr Farquhar. It was not merely that there had been no coquetting, but there
had been simple unconsciousness on Ruth's part, for so long a time after Jemima had discovered
Mr Farquhar's inclination for her; and when at length she had slowly awakened to some perception
of the state of his feelings, there had been a modest, shrinking dignity of manner, not startled,
or emotional, or even timid, but pure, grave, and quiet; and this conduct of Ruth's, Jemima
instinctively acknowledged to be of necessity transparent and sincere. Now, and here, there
was no hypocrisy; but some time, somewhere, on the part of somebody, what hypocrisy, what lies
must have been acted, if not absolutely spoken, before Ruth could have been received by them
all as the sweet, gentle, girlish widow, which she remembered they had all believed Mrs Denbigh
to be when first she came among them! Could Mr and Miss Benson know? Could they be a party
to the deceit? Not sufficiently acquainted with the world to understand how strong had been
the temptation to play the part they did, if they wished to give Ruth a chance, Jemima could
not believe them guilty of such deceit as the knowledge of Mrs Denbigh's previous conduct would
imply; and yet how it darkened the latter into a treacherous hypocrite, with a black secret
shut up in her soul for years--living in apparent confidence, and daily household familiarity
with the Bensons for years, yet never telling the remorse that ought to be corroding her heart!
Who was true? Who was not? Who was good and pure? Who was not? The very foundations of Jemima's
belief in her mind were shaken.

This is an atom: 
Could it be false? Could there be two Ruth Hiltons? She went over every morsel of evidence.
It could not be. She knew that Mrs Denbigh's former name had been Hilton. She had heard her
speak casually, but charily, of having lived in Fordham. She knew she had been in Wales but
a short time before she made her appearance in Eccleston. There was no doubt of the identity.
Into the middle of Jemima's pain and horror at the afternoon's discovery, there came a sense
of the power which the knowledge of this secret gave her over Ruth; but this was no relief,
only an aggravation of the regret with which Jemima looked back on her state of ignorance.
It was no wonder that when she arrived at home, she was so oppressed with headache that she
had to go to bed directly.

This is an atom: 
"Quiet, mother! quiet, dear, dear mother" (for she clung to the known and tried goodness of
her mother more than ever now), "that is all I want." And she was left to the stillness of
her darkened room, the blinds idly flapping to and fro in the soft evening breeze, and letting
in the rustling sound of the branches which waved close to her window, and the thrush's gurgling
warble, and the distant hum of the busy town.

This is an atom: 
Her jealousy was gone--she knew not how or where. She might shun and recoil from Ruth, but
she now thought that she could never more be jealous of her. In her pride of innocence, she
felt almost ashamed that such a feeling could have had existence. Could Mr Farquhar hesitate
between her own self and one who-- No! she could not name what Ruth had been, even in thought.
And yet he might never know, so fair a seeming did her rival wear. Oh! for one ray of God's
holy light to know what was seeming, and what was truth, in this traitorous hollow earth! It
might be--she used to think such things possible, before sorrow had embittered her--that Ruth
had worked her way through the deep purgatory of repentance up to something like purity again;
God only knew! If her present goodness was real--if, after having striven back thus far on
the heights, a fellow-woman was to throw her down into some terrible depth with her unkind,
incontinent tongue, that would be too cruel! And yet, if--there was such woeful uncertainty
and deceit somewhere--if Ruth-- No! that Jemima, with noble candour, admitted was impossible.
Whatever Ruth had been, she was good, and to be respected as such, now. It did not follow that
Jemima was to preserve the secret always; she doubted her own power to do so, if Mr Farquhar
came home again, and were still constant in his admiration of Mrs Denbigh, and if Mrs Denbigh
gave him any--the least encouragement. But this last she thought, from what she knew of Ruth's
character, was impossible. Only, what was impossible after this afternoon's discovery? At any
rate, she would watch and wait. Come what might, Ruth was in her power. And, strange to say,
this last certainty gave Jemima a kind of protecting, almost pitying, feeling for Ruth. Her
horror at the wrong was not diminished; but the more she thought of the struggles that the
wrong-doer must have made to extricate herself, the more she felt how cruel it would be to
baffle all by revealing what had been. But for her sisters' sake she had a duty to perform;
she must watch Ruth. He received me with great politeness, and conducted me, through another
gate and covered way, to a second square more spacious than the first. In the centre was a
most beautiful white marble basin, into which played a fountain
of water clear as crystal.

This is an atom: 
Over it was a kind of rotunda, supported by columns of elegant black
marble.

This is an atom: 
This superb square is paved with small pieces of marble, intermixed
with pebbles of various colours, in the mosaic style.

This is an atom: 
It is formed by four wings of the building. The front wing, exclusive of its magnificent entrance,
contains several apartments and waiting-rooms, occupied by the great officers of state; the
right, the library, and the treasury of the Emperor; the left, a superb mosque, and a school-room
for the use of the Emperor's children, where they are taught to read and write, and study the
Alcoran; and finally, the back, the great hall of audience, in which His Imperial Majesty was
seated cross-legged upon a kind of couch, under a crimson velvet canopy, most beautifully
decorated with figured work in gold.

This is an atom: 
I was introduced by Sidy Ameth; and after making my obsequious reverence, I stood at a great
distance, waiting the Imperial commands, when His Majesty was graciously pleased to order
me, by signs, to draw near, and then, by means of an interpreter, he informed me, that, in
consequence of the good I had done his subjects during my residence at Larache, he had long
been anxious to see and consult me. He desired me to ask any favours I chose, either for myself
or my country, and they should be granted immediately. I thanked His Majesty for his condescension,
and then presented him with a patent pistol, with seven barrels, which he examined very
attentively in every part, and appeared highly pleased with its construction.

This is an atom: 
He commanded the hall to be cleared, and in a very friendly and familiar way told me the nature
of his complaint; after which he summoned the chief eunuch, and desired me to follow him to
the seraglio, to prescribe for his favourite Sultana, who was seriously indisposed. On leaving
the hall of audience, we turned to the left, and arrived at a gate,
which terminated the piazza on the right side of the square.

This is an atom: 
Through this gate we entered a large passage, paved with marble; on each side were marble
benches, upon which the eunuch informed me, the inferior eunuchs and the female attendants of
the seraglio slept. This passage conducted us to another square, on the right of which is the
Imperial bath.

This is an atom: 
It is almost impossible to form an idea of the elegance and convenience of this structure,
which is used only by the Emperor.

This is an atom: 
Adjoining the bath is a refectory, which is constantly supplied
with every kind of refreshment.

This is an atom: 
The other sides of this square contained the apartments of two or more ladies of His Imperial
Majesty. It would be tedious to enumerate the several squares through which I passed; they
differ only in splendour and magnificence, according to the rank
and taste of those ladies to whom they belong: they all communicate
from one piazza to another, by means of passages, such as I have
described.

This is an atom: 
I was extremely indebted to my black conductor for giving me an opportunity of seeing the whole
of the seraglio; for I returned by a much less circuitous route
than that by which I went, the apartments of the Sultana being just
behind the Imperial bath.

This is an atom: 
But where shall I find words to give you an adequate idea of their lovely inhabitant? Conceive
every thing that is beautiful, and you may possibly arrive near
the mark.

This is an atom: 
She is rather below the middle size, exquisitely fair, and well
proportioned.

This is an atom: 
When I first saw her, she was in a very doubtful state, and I reported accordingly to the
Emperor; he was sensibly affected, and besought me to exert my
utmost skill, to preserve a life of so much value to him.

This is an atom: 
Happily, my efforts have been crowned with success, and I hope a
very short time will restore her to perfect health.

This is an atom: 
She controls him in every thing, and is considered, from her absolute
dominion over him, as the fountain of all favours.

This is an atom: 
The gardens of the seraglio are beautifully laid out by Europeans, and contain several elegant
pavilions and summer-houses, where the ladies take tea and recreate
themselves; baths, fountains, and solitary retreats for those
inclined to meditation: in short, nothing is wanting to render this
a Complete terrestrial paradise, but liberty, the deprivation of
which must embitter every enjoyment.

This is an atom: 
Muley Solyman, the present Emperor, is about thirty-eight years of
age, in height about six feet two inches, of a tolerably fair
complexion, with remarkably fine teeth, large dark eyes, aquiline
nose, and black beard; the _tout ensemble_ of his countenance noble
and majestic.

This is an atom: 
He governs Barbary with discretion and moderation; in the distribution
of justice, or in rewarding his subjects, he is just and impartial;
in his private conduct no less pious and exemplary, than, in his
public capacity, firm and resolute, prompt and courageous.

This is an atom: 
In my next letter I shall give you a brief account of the succession
of Sovereigns from the time of _Edris_ to the present reigning
family.

This is an atom: 
LETTER XII.

This is an atom: 
_Succession of the Sovereigns from their Founder to the present
Emperor._ 
Fez, ---- 1806.

This is an atom: 
Edris; the founder of Mahometanism in Barbary, was succeeded by his
posthumous son, _Edris the Second_, who founded the first monarchy,
after that of Mahomet, in these regions; and it was called the
Kingdom of the West.

This is an atom: 
The family of Edris continued to reign for about a hundred and fifty
years; but was disturbed, during the tenth century, by several
intestine divisions, excited by a crowd of usurpers, which terminated
in the total extinction of the Edrissites.

This is an atom: 
The tribe of Mequinici seized on several provinces, and founded, on the ruins of the ancient, the
present city of Mequinez.

This is an atom: 
_Abu-Tessifin_, a Maraboot, or Monk, taking advantage of the divisions which convulsed these
countries, and above all of the credulity of this fickle people, sent several of his disciples
to preach and excite the multitude to revolt, under the pretext
of recovering their liberties.

This is an atom: 
This great impostor was the chief of the tribe of _Lamthunes_,
surnamed _Morabethoon_, on account of the extreme rigour with which
they observed the forms of the new religion.

This is an atom: 
This tribe resided between Mount Atlas and the Desert. The Moors being weary of their Arabian
rulers, flocked in crowds to the standard of Tessefin, who soon found himself at the head
of a large army, by means of which he conquered, many provinces,
and established himself Sovereign of Mauritania.

This is an atom: 
He was succeeded by his son _Joseph-Ben-Tessefin_, who in 1086
finished the city of Morakesh, or Morocco, which his father had
begun, and there fixed his seat of government.

This is an atom: 
In 1097 he seized on the kingdom of Fez, and united it to that of Morocco: he also joined his forces
to those of the Mahometans in Spain, and conquered the city of Seville, subdued all Andalusia,
Grenada, and Murcia, penetrated as far as Cordova, and defeated the army of Alphonso VI. of
Spain. After which he returned, loaded with spoils, to Morocco, where he died. He was succeeded
by his son _Aly_, who likewise passed over into Spain, but was defeated and slain by Alphonso
at the battle of Moriella.

This is an atom: 
His son _Brahem_, an indolent prince, and much addicted to pleasure, was proclaimed King of
Morocco.

This is an atom: 
His profligacy favoured the ambitious projects of a Mahometan preacher, named _Mahomet Abdallah_. This
impostor assumed the name of _Mahedi, Commander of the Faithful_, and drew a host of people
to his standard.

This is an atom: 
In the course of his mission, he met another preacher, at the head
of a multitude of followers, who also styled himself _Mahedi_, or
_the Prophet_ expected at the end of ages.

This is an atom: 
These two adventurers, consulting their mutual interest, coalesced, and having completely succeeded
in seducing the people, by projects of reformation, _Abdallah_ was proclaimed King of Morocco,
and _Abdul-Momen_, the other imposter, General of the Faithful. This haying effected the
destruction of Brahem, he contrived to dispatch his colleague so privately as to avoid the
imputation of being accessary to his death, and succeeded him in the sovereignty. He demolished
all the palaces and mosques of the Kings in Morocco, and laid the greater part of that city
in ruins, it having shut its gates against him when, he presented himself before it; and he
destroyed the young son of Brahem with his own hands. He afterwards, however, rebuilt Morocco, and
died in 1155, in possession of the sovereign power.

This is an atom: 
He was succeeded by his son Joseph, who passed over into Spain, and engaging with the armies
of the Kings of Portugal and Leon, he was killed by a fall from
his horse.

This is an atom: 
His son _Abu-Jacob_, surnamed _Almonsor_ the Invincible, assumed the government, suppressed
the divisions that distracted the country, and, rendered himself so powerful and formidable,
that the Mahometan Kings in Spain elected him as their supreme ruler. After performing
numberless gallant exploits, he disappeared on a sudden, as some assert, to perform the pilgrimage
to Mecca; but it is most probable, he was secretly murdered and buried by the descendants of Abdallah.
His son ascended the throne, but died in a very short time of grief, in consequence of his
losses in Spain.
He was the last King of this family.

This is an atom: 
_Abdallah_, the Governor of Fez, of the tribe of Benimecius, usurped
the crown of his master.

This is an atom: 
Of his successors, the only prince who took part in the Mahometan wars in Spain was _Abul
Hassen_, who conquered Gibraltar, and built the fort which still retains the name of the _Moorish
Castle_.

This is an atom: 
He was dethroned and assassinated by his son, _Abul Hassen_, a ferocious and ambitious tyrant,
who left a son, named _Abu-Said_, of a very depraved character, in whose reign Ceuta, after a
long siege, was taken by Don John, King of Portugal.

This is an atom: 
These usurpers were completely extirpated by the house of Merini, which family in its turn
was overcome by _Muley Mahomet_, a Xeriffe of the same tribe, who seized the reins of
government.
His successors did not long enjoy the fruit of their usurpation, but were most dreadfully
disturbed by a series of revolutions and murders, fomented and
perpetrated by the mountaineers, a resolute, ferocious, and restless
people, who, after raising the various parts of the country in arms
one against the other, and subjecting them to all the calamities
of civil war, cruelly butchered _Muley Achmet_, the last of the
sons of _Muley Sidan_ and proclaimed their chief, _Crom-el-Hadgy_,
a bloodthirsty ruffian, of low birth, and eminent in cruelties, in
his stead.

This is an atom: 
This tyrant, to secure his new acquisition, inhumanly massacred all the male descendants of
the Xeriffes.
He soon became the object of universal detestation, and was poignarded by his Sultana on the day
of marriage. She was of the family of the Xeriffes, and consented to marry him, only that
she might have a better opportunity of sacrificing him to her revenge, for the murder of her
family.

This is an atom: 
After the tragical end of the descendants of the Xeriffes, these countries, but more especially
the province of Tafilet, experienced all the horrors of famine and pestilence, for several
years. The people of Tafilet considered it as a judgment from their Prophet for their injustice;
and, to appease him, they made a pilgrimage to Mecca, and easily prevailed on a Xeriffe, a
descendant of Mahomet, named _Muley Aly_, who resided in a town near Medina, to accompany
them back to this country. In the mean time, the seasons having become more genial, the harvests
were so abundant, that this credulous and superstitious people attributed the change entirely
to the arrival of the pious Xeriffe. He was unanimously proclaimed King of Tafilet, by the name
of _Muley Xeriffe_; and as such acknowledged by the other provinces,
with the exception of Morocco and its environs, which were then in
the possession of _Crom-el-Hadgy_, who having ended his career in
the manner described, was soon followed by his son; and the ancient
families who had ruled the empire being completely extinct, the new
King of Tafilet, from his birth, religion, and the public election,
was confirmed the legitimate Sovereign of the whole county.

This is an atom: 
Muley Xeriffe was the founder of the dynasty of _Fileli_, from which the present reigning
family is descended.

This is an atom: 
This country, totally exhausted by divisions and civil wars, acquired
the enjoyments of peace and plenty, during the reign of this prince,
who resided at Tafilet, and caused the Governors, who were entrusted
with provinces, to rule with equity.

This is an atom: 
He made it his whole study to render this fickle and turbulent
people happy; the latter part of his reign was perfectly undisturbed,
and his death was universally and justly lamented.

This is an atom: 
He was succeeded by his eldest son, who was proclaimed, without the disturbances usual on those
occasions, by the name of _Muley Mahomet_.

This is an atom: 
This prince, equally just and pious with his father, reigned for some time very peaceably;
and from his exemplary conduct would have continued to do so to
his death, to the increasing prosperity of his subjects, but for
his brother, _Muley Arshid_, an ambitious prince, who, endowed with
an intelligent mind, equal to the vast project he had in contemplation,
raised a rebellion, with a view to seize on the sovereign power.

This is an atom: 
At the head of a numerous party, in a pitched battle, he was however defeated, and taken
prisoner, by his brother _Muley Mahomet_.
But he recovered his liberty, by the aid of a negro slave, whom he rewarded by striking off
his head at the very instant he had enabled the monster to recover his liberty.

This is an atom: 
After wandering about for some time, stirring up the minds of the
people to revolt, Muley Arshid fled to the mountains of Rif, where
he offered his services to the Sovereign of those districts, who,
unfortunately discovering the abilities of the stranger, confided
to him the administration of his territories, when, after having
by stratagem and prodigality gained the troops and the people to
his interests, he dethroned and inhumanly butchered his royal
benefactor.

This is an atom: 
He then defeated his brother _Mahomet_, and closely besieged him in Tafilet, whence that good
prince died of grief. To enumerate the bloody exploits of this prince would extend my letter
to a volume; suffice it therefore to say, that his reign was short, and the remembrance of
it never to be effaced. He died in 1672 of a fractured skull, in consequence of a fall from
his horse.

This is an atom: 
He was succeeded by his brother _Muley Ishmael_, who distinguished himself by some brave actions;
and his reign would have formed a grand epoch in the history of this country, had he not stained
it by a succession of tyranny and cruelties, too shocking to dwell upon. He died in 1727
at the advanced age of eighty-one, leaving behind him a numerous offspring. This prince, in
order to ensure his despotic and arbitrary power, contrived to form a regular army of foreign
soldiers, which he effected, partly from the negro families, then
settled in Barbary, but principally from a vast number of blacks
which he obtained from the coast of Guinea.

This is an atom: 
_Muley-Achmet-Daiby_, one of the numerous sons of Ishmael, ascended the throne of Morocco,
and, after reigning two years, died of a dropsy. His successor, _Muley Abdallah_, by far
surpassed all his predecessors in point of vices and cruelty.

This is an atom: 
His conduct was so flagrant, that he was deposed no less than six times, but as often re-elected.
Amidst civil wars, divisions, and devastations, the plague again made its appearance, and
committed the same dreadful ravages as in the reign of _Ishmael_.

This is an atom: 
Being reinstated for the sixth time, _Abdallah_ took advantage of the troubles occasioned by this terrible
disease, to excite divisions among his negro soldiers, by whose power alone he had suffered
all his humiliations. Vast numbers of this warlike race fell the victims of his treachery,
and he succeeded in reducing them so low, that they were no longer a subject of dread to him.
Having thus freed himself of all cause of restraint, he recovered his power, and, if possible,
plunged deeper than ever into the gulf of iniquity; and each succeeding day was stained with
crimes of the blackest hue. The only sentiments with which he inspired his unhappy people
were those of terror and disgust. At length, worn out with age, he died at Fez in 1757; and
was succeeded by his son _Sidi Mahomet_, who had begun to reform several abuses, during the
latter part of his father's reign, when he had been entrusted with the government of
Morocco.

This is an atom: 
This prince, the father of the present Emperor, was endowed with an intelligent mind, and
possessed nothing of the barbarian. His political views, and excellent regulations, soon restored
the order of things. He directed all his care to the welfare of his people, both at home and
abroad; he concluded, and renewed, several advantageous commercial
treaties, with England, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark,
and Holland, with all of whom he maintained a good understanding
till 1777; when, gained over by the courts of France and Spain, he
broke the treaty with England, and refused to supply Gibraltar with
fresh provisions.

This is an atom: 
He appointed officers of the strictest integrity, and of moderate and resolute characters, to
the government of his provinces; and the whole period of his reign was exempt from those horrible
cruelties which had almost invariably disgraced the sceptres of his predecessors. He died at
an advanced age, at _Rabat_, on the 11th of April 1790.

This is an atom: 
After the old Emperor's death, the states of Barbary became convulsed by the civil discords,
attended with great effusion of bloody occasioned by Sidi Mahomet's numerous sons, who
severally aspired to the crown. The contest was for a long time doubtful and bloody; but at
length, Muley Yezid was proclaimed Emperor, by a powerful party. As the whole country was
up in arms, he had to combat with many difficulties in establishing himself on the throne. He
was no sooner confirmed in his power, than he exercised it with uncommon cruelty towards his
captives. Under the idea of striking terror into the minds of his subjects, by the force of
example, and deterring them from revolting again, he inflicted the most dreadful punishment
on those who had opposed his authority; some he caused to be hung up by the feet, and suffered
to perish for want of sustenance; others, to be crucified at the
gates of the city; and several high priests, and officers of state,
he deprived of the blessing of sight.

This is an atom: 
But his cruelty and inhumanity did not rest here. In the above proceedings he might possibly
urge in palliation a regard to his personal safety, and the possession of a crown which he
held by so precarious a tenure as the caprice of a multitude, who might wrest it from him
with as little scruple as they had bestowed it, if not awed by some terrible example; but
where shall we seek an excuse for his execrable barbarity to the poor Jews in his dominions,
whom he ordered to be massacred, without distinction? The carnage was most horrible; and the
property of this persecuted people was indiscriminately plundered by their rapacious murderers. Six
young Jewesses, who ventured to intercede for their unhappy fathers and relations, were burned
alive. My blood runs cold at the idea of such depravity; and I shrink, from the reflection that
our own history will furnish us with annals, almost or fully as replete with horror as the one I
am now relating.

This is an atom: 
It is not all surprising that such unjustifiable cruelty should
kindle disgust in the minds of those who were not totally divested
of the feelings of humanity.

This is an atom: 
Several of his provinces rebelled, but he successively reduced them to obedience; and in the
last battle which he fought, before the city of Morocco, and gained, he was severely wounded.
The rebel army was surrounded, and defeated with great slaughter. _Muley Yezid_ was carried
to the castle, and his wound dressed; but his treatment was so improper, that, after lingering a
few days in the most excruciating torture, he died in 1794.

This is an atom: 
The present Emperor, _Muley Solyman_, was the youngest prince, and
lived retired in the city of Fez, assiduously occupied in studying
the Alcoran and the laws of the empire, in order to qualify himself
for the office of high-priest, which he was intended to fill.

This is an atom: 
From this retreat he was called by the priests, the highest in repute as saints, in the
neighbourhood of Fez, and a small party of the Moorish militia, and by them prevailed upon to
come forward as a candidate for the crown, in opposition to his three brothers, who were waging war
with each other, at the head of numerous forces. In the midst of this anarchy and confusion,
the young prince was proclaimed Emperor at Fez, by the name of _Muley Solyman_; and having
collected a strong force, aided by the counsels of a number of brave and experienced officers,
he advanced to Mequinez, which he reduced, after two successive pitched battles. This place
was defended by one of his brothers, who shortly after acknowledged him as Emperor, joined
him, and brought over to his interests a great number of friends and partisans. He served
Solyman faithfully ever after, which enabled him to withstand the united forces of his two
other brothers. At length, owing to the little harmony that prevailed in the armies of his
competitors, he effected his purpose. Taking advantage of their increasing animosity, he
advanced towards Morocco, fighting and conquering the whole way. He entered the capital in
triumph, after a general and decisive battle; and he was again proclaimed Emperor.

This is an atom: 
This brave young prince had now reduced Barbary entirely under his sway, with the exception
of the kingdom of Tangiers. Thither the two unfortunate princes retired, in order to make a
last and desperate stand; but after a variety of struggles, to regain some degree of ascendancy,
one was compelled to solicit the protection of the Dey of Algiers, and the other was taken prisoner,
and banished to a remote province.

This is an atom: 
From that period, the Emperor has dedicated the whole of his time
and pursuits to the amelioration of his people's condition, by
improving his financial resources, and appointing over his provinces,
mild and humane Governors, whom he strictly superintends, occasionally
deposing such as have deviated from his orders, and often inflicting
upon these his representatives the most severe corporal punishments,
previous to their imprisonment for life.

This is an atom: 
LETTER XIII.

This is an atom: 
_Responsibility of the Governors--Empire beautiful and productive--Humane Efforts of the
Emperor--Blind Submission to his Will--Great Number of Negroes
naturalized--The Moors might be truly formidable.

This is an atom:

Fez.

This is an atom: 
Having extended my last letter to an unusual length, I broke off
rather abruptly; I shall therefore resume the subject in this.

This is an atom: 
The Governors commanding large districts or provinces in Barbary, are answerable for the crimes
and misdemeanors committed in their governments, if they fail to bring the offenders to
public justice; consequently they impose very heavy fines on the community, to impel them
to seize, and deliver to them, the murderer or robber. The sudden and frequent changes in the public
offices keep the most powerful Governors in the empire in continual awe and depression; and
the fear of being, in an instant, hurled from the height of prosperity to the lowest abyss
of adversity, usually prevents them from amassing great wealth, as it is sure to pass into
the Emperor's treasury on their disgrace; and the same cause prevents the forming of dangerous
cabals. Yet some of them contrive, during their short-lived administration, to squeeze from
their wretched vassals as much money as they can, by every fraudful artifice and despotic
violence.

This is an atom: 
The sufferers murmur, and complain; but the government appears to wink at the oppression for a time,
and reserves its dreadful vengeance till the annual review, on the plains of Fez, where the
collected spoils of the cruel peculator are seized, and himself deposed, imprisoned, and the whole
fruit of his rapine transferred to the royal treasury.

This is an atom: 
This empire is one of the most beautiful and fertile countries, perhaps in the world; but the
despotism under which it has groaned, and the capricious humours of its former rulers, destroyed,
and prevented the effects of industry; besides, the rapacity of the Sheiks, who are the
Bashaws of the country, carried off every thing that labour could collect.
Every creature in Eccleston may know
what he is; do you think they will spare him their scorn? 'Cannot bear it,' indeed! Before
you went into your sin, you should have thought whether you could bear the consequences or
not--have had some idea how far your offspring would be degraded and scouted, till the best
thing that could happen to him would be for him to be lost to all sense of shame, dead to all
knowledge of guilt, for his mother's sake."

This is an atom: 
Ruth spoke out. She stood like a wild creature at bay, past fear now. "I appeal to God against
such a doom for my child. I appeal to God to help me. I am a mother, and as such I cry to God
for help--for help to keep my boy in His pitying sight, and to bring him up in His holy fear.
Let the shame fall on me! I have deserved it, but he--he is so innocent and good."

This is an atom: 
Ruth had caught up her shawl, and was tying on her bonnet with her trembling hands. What if
Leonard was hearing of her shame from common report? What would be the mysterious shock of
the intelligence? She must face him, and see the look in his eyes, before she knew whether
he recoiled from her; he might have his heart turned to hate her, by their cruel jeers.

This is an atom: 
Jemima stood by, dumb and pitying. Her sorrow was past her power. She helped in arranging the
dress, with one or two gentle touches, which were hardly felt by Ruth, but which called out
all Mr Bradshaw's ire afresh; he absolutely took her by the shoulders and turned her by force
out of the room. In the hall, and along the stairs, her passionate woeful crying was heard.
The sound only concentrated Mr Bradshaw's anger on Ruth. He held the street-door open wide,
and said, between his teeth, "If ever you, or your bastard, darken this door again, I will
have you both turned out by the police!"

This is an atom: 
He need not have added this, if he had seen Ruth's face.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXVII

This is an atom: 
Preparing to Stand on the Truth

This is an atom: 
As Ruth went along the accustomed streets, every sight and every sound seemed to bear a new
meaning, and each and all to have some reference to her boy's disgrace. She held her head down,
and scudded along dizzy with fear, lest some word should have told him what she had been, and
what he was, before she could reach him. It was a wild, unreasoning fear, but it took hold
of her as strongly as if it had been well founded. And, indeed, the secret whispered by Mrs
Pearson, whose curiosity and suspicion had been excited by Jemima's manner, and confirmed since
by many a little corroborating circumstance, had spread abroad, and was known to most of the
gossips in Eccleston before it reached Mr Bradshaw's ears.

This is an atom: 
As Ruth came up to the door of the Chapel-house, it was opened, and Leonard came out, bright
and hopeful as the morning, his face radiant at the prospect of the happy day before him. He
was dressed in the clothes it had been such a pleasant pride to her to make for him. He had
the dark blue ribbon tied round his neck that she had left out for him that very morning, with
a smiling thought of how it would set off his brown, handsome face. She caught him by the hand
as they met, and turned him, with his face homewards, without a word. Her looks, her rushing
movement, her silence, awed him; and although he wondered, he did not stay to ask why she did
so. The door was on the latch; she opened it, and only said, "Upstairs," in a hoarse whisper.
Up they went into her own room. She drew him in, and bolted the door; and then, sitting down,
she placed him (she had never let go of him) before her, holding him with her hands on each
of his shoulders, and gazing into his face with a woeful look of the agony that could not find
vent in words. At last she tried to speak; she tried with strong bodily effort, almost amounting
to convulsion. But the words would not come; it was not till she saw the absolute terror depicted
on his face that she found utterance; and then the sight of that terror changed the words from
what she meant them to have been. She drew him to her, and laid her head upon his shoulder;
hiding her face even there.

This is an atom: 
"My poor, poor boy! my poor, poor darling! Oh! would that I had died--I had died, in my innocent
girlhood!"

This is an atom: 
"Mother! mother!" sobbed Leonard. "What is the matter? Why do you look so wild and ill? Why
do you call me your 'poor boy'? Are we not going to Scaurside-hill? I don't much mind it, mother;
only please don't gasp and quiver so. Dearest mother, are you ill? Let me call Aunt Faith!"

This is an atom: 
Ruth lifted herself up, and put away the hair that had fallen over and was blinding her eyes.
She looked at him with intense wistfulness.

This is an atom: 
"Kiss me, Leonard!" said she--"kiss me, my darling, once more in the old way!" Leonard threw
himself into her arms and hugged her with all his force, and their lips clung together as in
the kiss given to the dying.

This is an atom: 
"Leonard!" said she at length, holding him away from her, and nerving herself up to tell him
all by one spasmodic effort--"listen to me." The boy stood breathless and still, gazing at
her. On her impetuous transit from Mr Bradshaw's to the Chapel-house, her wild, desperate thought
had been that she would call herself by every violent, coarse name which the world might give
her--that Leonard should hear those words applied to his mother first from her own lips; but
the influence of his presence--for he was a holy and sacred creature in her eyes, and this
point remained steadfast, though all the rest were upheaved--subdued her; and now it seemed
as if she could not find words fine enough, and pure enough, to convey the truth that he must
learn, and should learn from no tongue but hers.

This is an atom: 
"Leonard--when I was very young I did very wrong. I think God, who knows all, will judge me
more tenderly than men--but I did wrong in a way which you cannot understand yet" (she saw
the red flush come into his cheek, and it stung her as the first token of that shame which
was to be his portion through life)--"in a way people never forget, never forgive. You will
hear me called the hardest names that ever can be thrown at women--I have been, to-day; and,
my child, you must bear it patiently, because they will be partly true. Never get confused,
by your love for me, into thinking that what I did was right.--Where was I?" said she, suddenly
faltering, and forgetting all she had said and all she had got to say; and then, seeing Leonard's
face of wonder, and burning shame and indignation, she went on more rapidly, as fearing lest
her strength should fail before she had ended.

This is an atom: 
"And, Leonard," continued she, in a trembling, sad voice, "this is not all. The punishment
of punishments lies awaiting me still. It is to see you suffer for my wrongdoing. Yes, darling!
they will speak shameful things of you, poor innocent child! as well as of me, who am guilty.
They will throw it in your teeth through life, that your mother was never married--was not
married when you were born--"

This is an atom: 
"Were not you married? Are not you a widow?" asked he abruptly, for the first time getting
anything like a clear idea of the real state of the case.

This is an atom: 
"No! May God forgive me, and help me!" exclaimed she, as she saw a strange look of repugnance
cloud over the boy's face, and felt a slight motion on his part to extricate himself from her
hold. It was as slight, as transient as it could be--over in an instant. But she had taken
her hands away, and covered up her face with them as quickly--covered up her face in shame
before her child; and in the bitterness of her heart she was wailing out, "Oh, would to God
I had died--that I had died as a baby--that I had died as a little baby hanging at my mother's
breast!"

This is an atom: 
"Mother," said Leonard, timidly putting his hand on her arm; but she shrunk from him, and continued
her low, passionate wailing. "Mother," said he, after a pause, coming nearer, though she saw
it not--"mammy darling," said he, using the caressing name, which he had been trying to drop
as not sufficiently manly, "mammy, my own, own dear, dear, darling mother, I don't believe
them--I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't!" He broke out into a wild burst of crying as he said
this. In a moment her arms were round the poor boy, and she was hushing him up like a baby
on her bosom. "Hush, Leonard! Leonard, be still, my child! I have been too sudden with you!--I
have done you harm--oh! I have done you nothing but harm," cried she, in a tone of bitter self-reproach.

This is an atom: 
"No, mother," said he, stopping his tears, and his eyes blazing out with earnestness; "there
never was such a mother as you have been to me, and I won't believe any one who says it. I
won't; and I'll knock them down if they say it again, I will!" He clenched his fist, with a
fierce, defiant look on his face.

This is an atom: 
"You forget, my child," said Ruth, in the sweetest, saddest tone that ever was heard, "I said
it of myself; I said it because it was true." Leonard threw his arms tight round her, and hid
his face against her bosom. She felt him pant there like some hunted creature. She had no soothing
comfort to give him. "Oh, that she and he lay dead!"

This is an atom: 
At last, exhausted, he lay so still and motionless, that she feared to look. She wanted him
to speak, yet dreaded his first words. She kissed his hair, his head, his very clothes, murmuring
low, inarticulate, moaning sounds.

This is an atom: 
"Leonard," said she, "Leonard, look up at me! Leonard, look up!" But he only clung the closer,
and hid his face the more.

This is an atom: 
"My boy!" said she, "what can I do or say? If I tell you never to mind it--that it is nothing--I
tell you false. It is a bitter shame and a sorrow that I have drawn down upon you. A shame,
Leonard, because of me, your mother; but, Leonard, it is no disgrace or lowering of you in
the eyes of God." She spoke now as if she had found the clue which might lead him to rest and
strength at last. "Remember that, always. Remember that, when the time of trial comes--and
it seems a hard and cruel thing that you should be called reproachful names by men, and all
for what was no fault of yours--remember God's pity and God's justice; and though my sin shall
have made you an outcast in the world--oh, my child, my child!"--(she felt him kiss her, as
if mutely trying to comfort her--it gave her strength to go on)--"remember, darling of my heart,
it is only your own sin that can make you an outcast from God."

This is an atom: 
She grew so faint that her hold of him relaxed. He looked up affrighted. He brought her water--he
threw it over her; in his terror at the notion that she was going to die and leave him, he
called her by every fond name, imploring her to open her eyes.

This is an atom: 
When she partially recovered, he helped her to the bed, on which she lay still, wan and death-like.
She almost hoped the swoon that hung around her might be Death, and in that imagination she
opened her eyes to take a last look at her boy. She saw him pale and terror-stricken; and pity
for his affright roused her, and made her forget herself in the wish that he should not see
her death, if she were indeed dying.

This is an atom: 
"Go to Aunt Faith!" whispered she; "I am weary, and want sleep."

This is an atom: 
Leonard arose slowly and reluctantly. She tried to smile upon him, that what she thought would
be her last look might dwell in his remembrance as tender and strong; she watched him to the
door; she saw him hesitate, and return to her. He came back to her, and said in a timid, apprehensive
tone:

This is an atom: 
"Mother--will _they_ speak to me about--it?"

This is an atom: 
Ruth closed her eyes, that they might not express the agony she felt, like a sharp knife, at
this question. Leonard had asked it with a child's desire of avoiding painful and mysterious
topics,--from no personal sense of shame as she understood it, shame beginning thus early,
thus instantaneously.

This is an atom: 
"No," she replied. "You may be sure they will not."

This is an atom: 
So he went. But now she would have been thankful for the unconsciousness of fainting; that
one little speech bore so much meaning to her hot, irritable brain. Mr and Miss Benson, all
in their house, would never speak to the boy--but in his home alone would he be safe from what
he had already learnt to dread. Every form in which shame and opprobrium could overwhelm her
darling, haunted her. She had been exercising strong self-control for his sake ever since she
had met him at the house-door; there was now a reaction. His presence had kept her mind on
its perfect balance. When that was withdrawn, the effect of the strain of power was felt. And
athwart the fever-mists that arose to obscure her judgment, all sorts of will-o'-the-wisp plans
flittered before her; tempting her to this and that course of action--to anything rather than
patient endurance--to relieve her present state of misery by some sudden spasmodic effort,
that took the semblance of being wise and right. Gradually all her desires, all her longing,
settled themselves on one point. What had she done--what could she do, to Leonard, but evil?
If she were away, and gone no one knew where--lost in mystery, as if she were dead--perhaps
the cruel hearts might relent, and show pity on Leonard; while her perpetual presence would
but call up the remembrance of his birth. Thus she reasoned in her hot, dull brain; and shaped
her plans in accordance.

This is an atom: 
Leonard stole downstairs noiselessly. He listened to find some quiet place where he could hide
himself. The house was very still. Miss Benson thought the purposed expedition had taken place,
and never dreamed but that Ruth and Leonard were on distant, sunny Scaurside-hill; and after
a very early dinner, she had set out to drink tea with a farmer's wife who lived in the country
two or three miles off. Mr Benson meant to have gone with her; but while they were at dinner,
he had received an unusually authoritative note from Mr Bradshaw desiring to speak with him,
so he went to that gentleman's house instead. Sally was busy in her kitchen, making a great
noise (not unlike a groom rubbing down a horse) over her cleaning. Leonard stole into the sitting-room,
and crouched behind the large old-fashioned sofa to ease his sore, aching heart, by crying
with all the prodigal waste and abandonment of childhood.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson was shown into Mr Bradshaw's own particular room. The latter gentleman was walking
up and down, and it was easy to perceive that something had occurred to chafe him to great anger.

This is an atom: 
"Sit down, sir!" said he to Mr Benson, nodding to a chair.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson sat down. But Mr Bradshaw continued his walk for a few minutes longer without speaking.
Then he stopped abruptly, right in front of Mr Benson; and in a voice which he tried to render
calm, but which trembled with passion--with a face glowing purple as he thought of his wrongs
(and real wrongs they were), he began:

This is an atom: 
"Mr Benson, I have sent for you to ask--I am almost too indignant at the bare suspicion to
speak as becomes me--but did you--I really shall be obliged to beg your pardon, if you are
as much in the dark as I was yesterday as to the character of that woman who lives under your
roof?"

This is an atom: 
There was no answer from Mr Benson. Mr Bradshaw looked at him very earnestly. His eyes were
fixed on the ground--he made no inquiry--he uttered no expression of wonder or dismay. Mr Bradshaw
ground his foot on the floor with gathering rage; but just as he was about to speak, Mr Benson
rose up--a poor deformed old man--before the stern and portly figure that was swelling and
panting with passion.

This is an atom: 
"Hear me, sir!" (stretching out his hand as if to avert the words which were impending). "Nothing
you can say, can upbraid me like my own conscience; no degradation you can inflict, by word
or deed, can come up to the degradation I have suffered for years, at being a party to a deceit,
even for a good end--"

This is an atom: 
"For a good end!--Nay! what next?"

This is an atom: 
The taunting contempt with which Mr Bradshaw spoke these words almost surprised himself by
what he imagined must be its successful power of withering; but in spite of it, Mr Benson lifted
his grave eyes to Mr Bradshaw's countenance, and repeated:

This is an atom: 
"For a good end. The end was not, as perhaps you consider it to have been, to obtain her admission
into your family--nor yet to put her in the way of gaining her livelihood; my sister and I
would willingly have shared what we have with her; it was our intention to do so at first,
if not for any length of time, at least as long as her health might require it. Why I advised
(perhaps I only yielded to advice) a change of name--an assumption of a false state of widowhood--was
because I earnestly desired to place her in circumstances in which she might work out her self-redemption;
and you, sir, know how terribly the world goes against all such as have sinned as Ruth did.
She was so young, too."

This is an atom: 
"You mistake, sir; my acquaintance has not lain so much among that class of sinners as to give
me much experience of the way in which they are treated. But, judging from what I have seen,
I should say they meet with full as much leniency as they deserve; and supposing they do not--I
know there are plenty of sickly sentimentalists just now who reserve all their interest and
regard for criminals--why not pick out one of these to help you in your task of washing the
blackamoor white? Why choose me to be imposed upon--my household into which to intrude your
protÃ©gÃ©e? Why were my innocent children to be exposed to corruption? I say," said Mr Bradshaw,
stamping his foot, "how dared you come into this house, where you were looked upon as a minister
of religion, with a lie in your mouth? How dared you single me out, of all people, to be gulled
and deceived, and pointed at through the town as the person who had taken an abandoned woman
into his house to teach his daughters?"

This is an atom: 
"I own my deceit was wrong and faithless."

This is an atom: 
"Yes! you can own it, now it is found out! There is small merit in that, I think!"

This is an atom: 
"Sir! I claim no merit. I take shame to myself. I did not single you out. You applied to me
with your proposal that Ruth should be your children's governess."

This is an atom: 
"Pah!"

This is an atom: 
"And the temptation was too great-- No! I will not say that--but the temptation was greater
than I could stand--it seemed to open out a path of usefulness."

This is an atom: 
"Now, don't let me hear you speak so," said Mr Bradshaw, blazing up. "I can't stand it. It
is too much to talk in that way when the usefulness was to consist in contaminating my innocent
girls."

This is an atom: 
"God knows that if I had believed there had been any danger of such contamination--God knows
how I would have died sooner than have allowed her to enter your family. Mr Bradshaw, you believe
me, don't you?" asked Mr Benson, earnestly.

This is an atom: 
"I really must be allowed the privilege of doubting what you say in future," said Mr Bradshaw,
in a cold, contemptuous manner.

This is an atom: 
"I have deserved this," Mr Benson replied. "But," continued he, after a moment's pause, "I
will not speak of myself, but of Ruth. Surely, sir, the end I aimed at (the means I took to
obtain it were wrong; you cannot feel that more than I do) was a right one; and you will not--you
cannot say, that your children have suffered from associating with her. I had her in my family,
under the watchful eyes of three anxious persons for a year or more; we saw faults--no human
being is without them--and poor Ruth's were but slight venial errors; but we saw no sign of
a corrupt mind--no glimpse of boldness or forwardness--no token of want of conscientiousness;
she seemed, and was, a young and gentle girl, who had been led astray before she fairly knew
what life was."

This is an atom: 
"I suppose most depraved women have been innocent in their time," said Mr Bradshaw, with bitter
contempt.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Mr Bradshaw! Ruth was not depraved, and you know it. You cannot have seen her--have known
her daily, all these years, without acknowledging that!" Mr Benson was almost breathless, awaiting
Mr Bradshaw's answer. The quiet self-control which he had maintained so long, was gone now.

This is an atom: 
"I saw her daily--I did _not_ know her. If I had known her, I should have known she was fallen
and depraved, and consequently not fit to come into my house, nor to associate with my pure
children."

This is an atom: 
"Now I wish God would give me power to speak out convincingly what I believe to be His truth,
that not every woman who has fallen is depraved; that many--how many the Great Judgment Day
will reveal to those who have shaken off the poor, sore, penitent hearts on earth--many, many
crave and hunger after a chance for virtue--the help which no man gives to them--help--that
gentle, tender help which Jesus gave once to Mary Magdalen." Mr Benson was almost choked by
his own feelings.

This is an atom: 
"Come, come, Mr Benson, let us have no more of this morbid way of talking. The world has decided
how such women are to be treated; and, you may depend upon it, there is so much practical wisdom
in the world that its way of acting is right in the long run, and that no one can fly in its
face with impunity, unless, indeed, they stoop to deceit and imposition."

This is an atom: 
"I take my stand with Christ against the world," said Mr Benson, solemnly, disregarding the
covert allusion to himself. "What have the world's ways ended in? Can we be much worse than
we are?"

This is an atom: 
"Speak for yourself, if you please."

This is an atom: 
"Is it not time to change some of our ways of thinking and acting? I declare before God, that
if I believe in any one human truth, it is this--that to every woman who, like Ruth, has sinned,
should be given a chance of self-redemption--and that such a chance should be given in no supercilious
or contemptuous manner, but in the spirit of the holy Christ."

This is an atom: 
"Such as getting her into a friend's house under false colours."

This is an atom: 
"I do not argue on Ruth's case. In that I have acknowledged my error. I do not argue on any
case. I state my firm belief, that it is God's will that we should not dare to trample any
of His creatures down to the hopeless dust; that it is God's will that the women who have fallen
should be numbered among those who have broken hearts to be bound up, not cast aside as lost
beyond recall. If this be God's will, as a thing of God it will stand; and He will open a way."

This is an atom: 
"I should have attached much more importance to all your exhortation on this point if I could
have respected your conduct in other matters. As it is, when I see a man who has deluded himself
into considering falsehood right, I am disinclined to take his opinion on subjects connected
with morality; and I can no longer regard him as a fitting exponent of the will of God. You
perhaps understand what I mean, Mr Benson. I can no longer attend your chapel."

This is an atom: 
If Mr Benson had felt any hope of making Mr Bradshaw's obstinate mind receive the truth, that
he acknowledged and repented of his connivance at the falsehood by means of which Ruth had
been received into the Bradshaw family, this last sentence prevented his making the attempt.
He simply bowed and took his leave--Mr Bradshaw attending him to the door with formal ceremony.

This is an atom: 
He felt acutely the severance of the tie which Mr Bradshaw had just announced to him. He had
experienced many mortifications in his intercourse with that gentleman, but they had fallen
off from his meek spirit like drops of water from a bird's plumage; and now he only remembered
the acts of substantial kindness rendered (the ostentation all forgotten)--many happy hours
and pleasant evenings--the children whom he had loved dearer than he thought till now--the
young people about whom he had cared, and whom he had striven to lead aright. He was but a
young man when Mr Bradshaw first came to his chapel; they had grown old together; he had never
recognised Mr Bradshaw as an old familiar friend so completely as now when they were severed.

This is an atom: 
It was with a heavy heart that he opened his own door. He went to his study immediately; he
sat down to steady himself into his position.

This is an atom: 
How long he was there--silent and alone--reviewing his life--confessing his sins--he did not
know; but he heard some unusual sound in the house that disturbed him--roused him to present
life. A slow, languid step came along the passage to the front door--the breathing was broken
by many sighs.

This is an atom: 
Ruth's hand was on the latch when Mr Benson came out. Her face was very white, except two red
spots on each cheek--her eyes were deep-sunk and hollow, but glittered with feverish lustre.
"Ruth!" exclaimed he. She moved her lips, but her throat and mouth were too dry for her to speak.

This is an atom: 
"Where are you going?" asked he; for she had all her walking things on, yet trembled so, even
as she stood, that it was evident she could not walk far without falling.

This is an atom: 
She hesitated--she looked up at him, still with the same dry glittering eyes. At last she whispered
(for she could only speak in a whisper), "To Helmsby--I am going to Helmsby."

This is an atom: 
"Helmsby! my poor girl--may God have mercy upon you!" for he saw she hardly knew what she was
saying. "Where is Helmsby?"

This is an atom: 
"I don't know. In Lincolnshire, I think."

This is an atom: 
"But why are you going there?"

This is an atom: 
"Hush! he's asleep," said she, as Mr Benson had unconsciously raised his voice.

This is an atom: 
"Who is asleep?" asked Mr Benson.

This is an atom: 
"That poor little boy," said she, beginning to quiver and cry.

This is an atom: 
"Come here!" said he, authoritatively, drawing her into the study.

This is an atom: 
"Sit down in that chair. I will come back directly."

This is an atom: 
He went in search of his sister, but she had not returned. Then he had recourse to Sally, who
was as busy as ever about her cleaning.

This is an atom: 
"How long has Ruth been at home?" asked he.

This is an atom: 
"Ruth! She has never been at home sin' morning. She and Leonard were to be off for the day
somewhere or other with them Bradshaw girls."

This is an atom: 
"Then she has had no dinner?"

This is an atom: 
"Not here, at any rate. I can't answer for what she may have done at other places."

This is an atom: 
"And Leonard--where is he?"

This is an atom: 
"How should I know? With his mother, I suppose. Leastways, that was what was fixed on. I've
enough to do of my own, without routing after other folks."

This is an atom: 
She went on scouring in no very good temper. Mr Benson stood silent for a moment.

This is an atom: 
"Sally," he said, "I want a cup of tea. Will you make it as soon as you can; and some dry toast
too? I'll come for it in ten minutes."

This is an atom: 
Struck by something in his voice, she looked up at him for the first time.

This is an atom: 
"What ha' ye been doing to yourself, to look so grim and grey? Tiring yourself all to tatters,
looking after some naught, I'll be bound! Well! well! I mun make ye your tea, I reckon; but
I did hope as you grew older you'd ha' grown wiser!"

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson made no reply, but went to look for Leonard, hoping that the child's presence might
bring back to his mother the power of self-control. He opened the parlour-door, and looked
in, but saw no one. Just as he was shutting it, however, he heard a deep, broken, sobbing sigh;
and, guided by the sound, he found the boy lying on the floor, fast asleep, but with his features
all swollen and disfigured by passionate crying.

This is an atom: 
"Poor child! This was what she meant, then," thought Mr Benson. "He has begun his share of
the sorrows too," he continued, pitifully. "No! I will not waken him back to consciousness."
So he returned alone into the study. Ruth sat where he had placed her, her head bent back,
and her eyes shut. But when he came in she started up.

This is an atom: 
"I must be going," she said, in a hurried way.

This is an atom: 
"Nay, Ruth, you must not go. You must not leave us. We cannot do without you. We love you too
much."

This is an atom: 
"Love me!" said she, looking at him wistfully. As she looked, her eyes filled slowly with tears.
It was a good sign, and Mr Benson took heart to go on.

This is an atom: 
"Yes! Ruth. You know we do. You may have other things to fill up your mind just now, but you
know we love you; and nothing can alter our love for you. You ought not to have thought of
leaving us. You would not, if you had been quite well."

This is an atom: 
"Do you know what has happened?" she asked, in a low, hoarse voice.

This is an atom: 
"Yes. I know all," he answered. "It makes no difference to us. Why should it?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh! Mr Benson, don't you know that my shame is discovered?" she replied, bursting into tears--"and
I must leave you, and leave Leonard, that you may not share in my disgrace."

This is an atom: 
"You must do no such thing. Leave Leonard! You have no right to leave Leonard. Where could
you go to?"

This is an atom: 
"To Helmsby," she said, humbly. "It would break my heart to go, but I think I ought, for Leonard's
sake. I know I ought." She was crying sadly by this time, but Mr Benson knew the flow of tears
would ease her brain. "It will break my heart to go, but I know I must."

This is an atom: 
"Sit still here at present," said he, in a decided tone of command. He went for the cup of
tea. He brought it to her without Sally's being aware for whom it was intended.

This is an atom: 
"Drink this!" He spoke as you would do to a child, if desiring it to take medicine. "Eat some
toast." She took the tea, and drank it feverishly; but when she tried to eat, the food seemed
to choke her. Still she was docile, and she tried.

This is an atom: 
"I cannot," said she at last, putting down the piece of toast. There was a return to something
of her usual tone in the words. She spoke gently and softly; no longer in the shrill, hoarse
voice she had used at first. Mr Benson sat down by her.

This is an atom: 
"Now, Ruth, we must talk a little together. I want to understand what your plan was. Where
is Helmsby? Why did you fix to go there?"

This is an atom: 
"It is where my mother lived," she answered. "Before she was married she lived there; and wherever
she lived, the people all loved her dearly; and I thought--I think, that for her sake some
one would give me work. I meant to tell them the truth," said she, dropping her eyes; "but
still they would, perhaps, give me some employment--I don't care what--for her sake. I could
do many things," said she, suddenly looking up. "I am sure I could weed--I could in gardens--if
they did not like to have me in their houses. But perhaps some one, for my mother's sake--oh!
my dear, dear mother!--do you know where and what I am?" she cried out, sobbing afresh.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson's heart was very sore, though he spoke authoritatively, and almost sternly.

This is an atom: 
"Ruth! you must be still and quiet. I cannot have this. I want you to listen to me. Your thought
of Helmsby would be a good one, if it was right for you to leave Eccleston; but I do not think
it is. I am certain of this, that it would be a great sin in you to separate yourself from
Leonard. You have no right to sever the tie by which God has bound you together."

This is an atom: 
"But if I am here they will all know and remember the shame of his birth; and if I go away
they may forget--"

This is an atom: 
"And they may not. And if you go away, he may be unhappy or ill; and you, who above all others
have--and have from God--remember _that_, Ruth!--the power to comfort him, the tender patience
to nurse him, have left him to the care of strangers. Yes; I know! But we ourselves are as
strangers, dearly as we love him, compared to a mother. He may turn to sin, and want the long
forbearance, the serene authority of a parent; and where are you? No dread of shame, either
for yourself, or even for him, can ever make it right for you to shake off your responsibility."
All this time he was watching her narrowly, and saw her slowly yield herself up to the force
of what he was saying.

This is an atom: 
"Besides, Ruth," he continued, "we have gone on falsely hitherto. It has been my doing, my
mistake, my sin. I ought to have known better. Now, let us stand firm on the truth. You have
no new fault to repent of. Be brave and faithful. It is to God you answer, not to men. The
shame of having your sin known to the world, should be as nothing to the shame you felt at
having sinned. We have dreaded men too much, and God too little, in the course we have taken.
But now be of good cheer. Perhaps you will have to find your work in the world very low--not
quite working in the fields," said he, with a gentle smile, to which she, downcast and miserable,
could give no response. "Nay, perhaps, Ruth," he went on, "you may have to stand and wait for
some time; no one may be willing to use the services you would gladly render; all may turn
aside from you, and may speak very harshly of you. Can you accept all this treatment meekly,
as but the reasonable and just penance God has laid upon you--feeling no anger against those
who slight you, no impatience for the time to come (and come it surely will--I speak as having
the word of God for what I say) when He, having purified you, even as by fire, will make a
straight path for your feet? My child, it is Christ the Lord who has told us of this infinite
mercy of God. Have you faith enough in it to be brave, and bear on, and do rightly in patience
and in tribulation?"

This is an atom: 
Ruth had been hushed and very still until now, when the pleading earnestness of his question
urged her to answer:

This is an atom: 
"Yes!" said she. "I hope--I believe I can be faithful for myself, for I have sinned and done
wrong. But Leonard--" She looked up at him.

This is an atom: 
"But Leonard," he echoed. "Ah! there it is hard, Ruth. I own the world is hard and persecuting
to such as he." He paused to think of the true comfort for this sting. He went on. "The world
is not everything, Ruth; nor is the want of men's good opinion and esteem the highest need
which man has. Teach Leonard this. You would not wish his life to be one summer's day. You
dared not make it so, if you had the power. Teach him to bid a noble, Christian welcome to
the trials which God sends--and this is one of them. Teach him not to look on a life of struggle,
and perhaps of disappointment and incompleteness, as a sad and mournful end, but as the means
permitted to the heroes and warriors in the army of Christ, by which to show their faithful
following. Tell him of the hard and thorny path which was trodden once by the bleeding feet
of One. Ruth! think of the Saviour's life and cruel death, and of His divine faithfulness.
Oh, Ruth!" exclaimed he, "when I look and see what you may be--what you _must_ be to that boy,
I cannot think how you could be coward enough, for a moment, to shrink from your work! But
we have all been cowards hitherto," he added, in bitter self-accusation. "God help us to be
so no longer!"

This is an atom: 
Ruth sat very quiet. Her eyes were fixed on the ground, and she seemed lost in thought. At
length she rose up.

This is an atom: 
"Mr Benson!" said she, standing before him, and propping herself by the table, as she was trembling
sadly from weakness, "I mean to try very, very hard, to do my duty to Leonard--and to God,"
she added, reverently. "I am only afraid my faith may sometimes fail about Leonard--"

This is an atom: 
"Ask, and it shall be given unto you. That is no vain or untried promise, Ruth!"

This is an atom: 
She sat down again, unable longer to stand. There was another long silence.

This is an atom: 
"I must never go to Mr Bradshaw's again," she said at last, as if thinking aloud.

This is an atom: 
"No, Ruth, you shall not," he answered.

This is an atom: 
"But I shall earn no money!" added she, quickly, for she thought that he did not perceive the
difficulty that was troubling her.

This is an atom: 
"You surely know, Ruth, that while Faith and I have a roof to shelter us, or bread to eat,
you and Leonard share it with us."

This is an atom: 
"I know--I know your most tender goodness," said she, "but it ought not to be."

This is an atom: 
"It must be at present," he said, in a decided manner. "Perhaps before long you may have some
employment; perhaps it may be some time before an opportunity occurs."

This is an atom: 
"Hush," said Ruth; "Leonard is moving about in the parlour. I must go to him."

This is an atom: 
But when she stood up, she turned so dizzy, and tottered so much, that she was glad to sit
down again immediately.

This is an atom: 
"You must rest here. I will go to him," said Mr Benson. He left her; and when he was gone,
she leaned her head on the back of the chair, and cried quietly and incessantly; but there
was a more patient, hopeful, resolved feeling in her heart, which all along, through all the
tears she shed, bore her onwards to higher thoughts, until at last she rose to prayers.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson caught the new look of shrinking shame in Leonard's eye, as it first sought, then
shunned, meeting his. He was pained, too, by the sight of the little sorrowful, anxious face,
on which, until now, hope and joy had been predominant. The constrained voice, the few words
the boy spoke, when formerly there would have been a glad and free utterance--all this grieved
Mr Benson inexpressibly, as but the beginning of an unwonted mortification, which must last
for years. He himself made no allusion to any unusual occurrence; he spoke of Ruth as sitting,
overcome by headache, in the study for quietness: he hurried on the preparations for tea, while
Leonard sat by in the great arm-chair, and looked on with sad, dreamy eyes. He strove to lessen
the shock which he knew Leonard had received, by every mixture of tenderness and cheerfulness
that Mr Benson's gentle heart prompted; and now and then a languid smile stole over the boy's
face. When his bedtime came, Mr Benson told him of the hour, although he feared that Leonard
would have but another sorrowful crying of himself to sleep; but he was anxious to accustom
the boy to cheerful movement within the limits of domestic law, and by no disobedience to it
to weaken the power of glad submission to the Supreme; to begin the new life that lay before
him, where strength to look up to God as the Law-giver and Ruler of events would be pre-eminently
required. When Leonard had gone upstairs, Mr Benson went immediately to Ruth, and said,

This is an atom: 
"Ruth! Leonard is just gone up to bed," secure in the instinct which made her silently rise,
and go up to the boy--certain, too, that they would each be the other's best comforter, and
that God would strengthen each through the other.

This is an atom: 
Now, for the first time, he had leisure to think of himself; and to go over all the events
of the day. The half-hour of solitude in his study, that he had before his sister's return,
was of inestimable value; he had leisure to put events in their true places, as to importance
and eternal significance.

This is an atom: 
Miss Faith came in laden with farm produce. Her kind entertainers had brought her in their
shandry to the opening of the court in which the Chapel-house stood; but she was so heavily
burdened with eggs, mushrooms, and plums, that when her brother opened the door she was almost
breathless.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Thurstan! take this basket--it is such a weight! Oh, Sally, is that you? Here are some
magnum-bonums which we must preserve to-morrow. There are guinea-fowl eggs in that basket."

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson let her unburden her body, and her mind too, by giving charges to Sally respecting
her housekeeping treasures, before he said a word; but when she returned into the study, to
tell him the small pieces of intelligence respecting her day at the farm, she stood aghast.

This is an atom: 
"Why, Thurstan, dear! What's the matter? Is your back hurting you?"

This is an atom: 
He smiled to reassure her; but it was a sickly and forced smile.

This is an atom: 
"No, Faith! I am quite well, only rather out of spirits, and wanting to talk to you to cheer me."

This is an atom: 
Miss Faith sat down, straight, sitting bolt-upright to listen the better.

This is an atom: 
"I don't know how, but the real story about Ruth is found out."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Thurstan!" exclaimed Miss Benson, turning quite white.

This is an atom: 
For a moment, neither of them said another word. Then she went on.

This is an atom: 
"Does Mr Bradshaw know?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes! He sent for me, and told me."

This is an atom: 
"Does Ruth know that it has all come out?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes. And Leonard knows."

This is an atom: 
"How? Who told him?"

This is an atom: 
"I do not know. I have asked no questions. But of course it was his mother."

This is an atom: 
"She was very foolish and cruel, then," said Miss Benson, her eyes blazing, and her lips trembling,
at the thought of the suffering her darling boy must have gone through.

This is an atom: 
"I think she was wise. I am sure it was not cruel. He must have soon known that there was some
mystery, and it was better that it should be told him openly and quietly by his mother than
by a stranger."

This is an atom: 
"How could she tell him quietly?" asked Miss Benson, still indignant.

This is an atom: 
"Well! perhaps I used the wrong word--of course no one was by--and I don't suppose even they
themselves could now tell how it was told, or in what spirit it was borne."

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson was silent again.

This is an atom: 
"Was Mr Bradshaw very angry?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, very; and justly so. I did very wrong in making that false statement at first."

This is an atom: 
"No! I am sure you did not," said Miss Faith. "Ruth has had some years of peace, in which to
grow stronger and wiser, so that she can bear her shame now in a way she never could have done
at first."

This is an atom: 
"All the same it was wrong in me to do what I did."

This is an atom: 
"I did it too, as much or more than you. And I don't think it wrong. I'm certain it was quite
right, and I would do just the same again."

This is an atom: 
"Perhaps it has not done you the harm it has done me."

This is an atom: 
"Nonsense! Thurstan. Don't be morbid. I'm sure you are as good--and better than ever you were."

This is an atom: 
"No, I am not. I have got what you call morbid just in consequence of the sophistry by which
I persuaded myself that wrong could be right. I torment myself. I have lost my clear instincts
of conscience. Formerly, if I believed that such or such an action was according to the will
of God, I went and did it, or at least I tried to do it, without thinking of consequences.
Now, I reason and weigh what will happen if I do so and so--I grope where formerly I saw. Oh,
Faith! it is such a relief to me to have the truth known, that I am afraid I have not been
sufficiently sympathising with Ruth."

This is an atom: 
"Poor Ruth!" said Miss Benson. "But at any rate our telling a lie has been the saving of her.
There is no fear of her going wrong now."

This is an atom: 
"God's omnipotence did not need our sin."

This is an atom: 
They did not speak for some time.

This is an atom: 
"You have not told me what Mr Bradshaw said."

This is an atom: 
"One can't remember the exact words that are spoken on either side in moments of such strong
excitement. He was very angry, and said some things about me that were very just, and some
about Ruth that were very hard. His last words were that he should give up coming to chapel."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Thurstan! did it come to that?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes."

This is an atom: 
"Does Ruth know all he said?"

This is an atom: 
"No! Why should she? I don't know if she knows he has spoken to me at all. Poor creature! she
had enough to craze her almost without that! She was for going away and leaving us, that we
might not share in her disgrace. I was afraid of her being quite delirious. I did so want you,
Faith! However, I did the best I could; I spoke to her very coldly, and almost sternly, all
the while my heart was bleeding for her. I dared not give her sympathy; I tried to give her
strength. But I did so want you, Faith."

This is an atom: 
"And I was so full of enjoyment, I am ashamed to think of it. But the Dawsons are so kind--and
the day was so fine-- Where is Ruth now?"

This is an atom: 
"With Leonard. He is her great earthly motive--I thought that being with him would be best.
But he must be in bed and asleep now."

This is an atom: 
"I will go up to her," said Miss Faith.

This is an atom: 
She found Ruth keeping watch by Leonard's troubled sleep; but when she saw Miss Faith she rose
up, and threw herself on her neck and clung to her, without speaking. After a while Miss Benson
said:

This is an atom: 
"You must go to bed, Ruth!" So, after she had kissed the sleeping boy, Miss Benson led her
away, and helped to undress her, and brought her up a cup of soothing violet tea--not so soothing
as tender actions and soft loving tones.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXVIII

This is an atom: 
An Understanding Between Lovers

This is an atom: 
It was well they had so early and so truly strengthened the spirit to bear, for the events
which had to be endured soon came thick and threefold.

This is an atom: 
Every evening Mr and Miss Benson thought the worst must be over; and every day brought some
fresh occurrence to touch upon the raw place. They could not be certain, until they had seen
all their acquaintances, what difference it would make in the cordiality of their reception:
in some cases it made much; and Miss Benson was proportionably indignant. She felt this change
in behaviour more than her brother. His great pain arose from the coolness of the Bradshaws.
With all the faults which had at times grated on his sensitive nature (but which he now forgot,
and remembered only their kindness), they were his old familiar friends--his kind, if ostentatious,
patrons--his great personal interest, out of his own family; and he could not get over the
suffering he experienced from seeing their large square pew empty on Sundays--from perceiving
how Mr Bradshaw, though he bowed in a distant manner when he and Mr Benson met face to face,
shunned him as often as he possibly could. All that happened in the household, which once was
as patent to him as his own, was now a sealed book; he heard of its doings by chance, if he
heard at all. Just at the time when he was feeling the most depressed from this cause, he met
Jemima at a sudden turn of the street. He was uncertain for a moment how to accost her, but
she saved him all doubt; in an instant she had his hand in both of hers, her face flushed with
honest delight.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Mr Benson, I am so glad to see you! I have so wanted to know all about you! How is poor
Ruth? dear Ruth! I wonder if she has forgiven me my cruelty to her? And I may not go to her
now, when I should be so glad and thankful to make up for it."

This is an atom: 
"I never heard you had been cruel to her. I am sure she does not think so."

This is an atom: 
"She ought; she must. What is she doing? Oh! I have so much to ask, I can never hear enough;
and papa says"--she hesitated a moment, afraid of giving pain, and then, believing that they
would understand the state of affairs, and the reason for her behaviour better if she told
the truth, she went on: "Papa says I must not go to your house--I suppose it's right to obey him?"

This is an atom: 
"Certainly, my dear. It is your clear duty. We know how you feel towards us."

This is an atom: 
"Oh! but if I could do any good--if I could be of any use or comfort to any of you--especially
to Ruth, I should come, duty or not. I believe it would be my duty," said she, hurrying on
to try and stop any decided prohibition from Mr Benson. "No! don't be afraid; I won't come
till I know I can do some good. I hear bits about you through Sally every now and then, or
I could not have waited so long. Mr Benson," continued she, reddening very much, "I think you
did quite right about poor Ruth."

This is an atom: 
"Not in the falsehood, my dear."

This is an atom: 
"No! not perhaps in that. I was not thinking of that. But I have been thinking a great deal
about poor Ruth's--you know I could not help it when everybody was talking about it--and it
made me think of myself, and what I am. With a father and mother, and home and careful friends,
I am not likely to be tempted like Ruth; but oh! Mr Benson," said she, lifting her eyes, which
were full of tears, to his face, for the first time since she began to speak, "if you knew
all I have been thinking and feeling this last year, you would see how I have yielded to every
temptation that was able to come to me; and, seeing how I have no goodness or strength in me,
and how I might just have been like Ruth, or rather, worse than she ever was, because I am
more headstrong and passionate by nature, I do so thank you and love you for what you did for
her! And will you tell me really and truly now if I can ever do anything for Ruth? If you'll
promise me that, I won't rebel unnecessarily against papa; but if you don't, I will, and come
and see you all this very afternoon. Remember! I trust you!" said she, breaking away. Then
turning back, she came to ask after Leonard.

This is an atom: 
"He must know something of it," said she. "Does he feel it much?"

This is an atom: 
"Very much," said Mr Benson. Jemima shook her head sadly.

This is an atom: 
"It is hard upon him," said she.

This is an atom: 
"It is," Mr Benson replied.

This is an atom: 
For in truth, Leonard was their greatest anxiety indoors. His health seemed shaken, he spoke
half sentences in his sleep, which showed that in his dreams he was battling on his mother's
behalf against an unkind and angry world. And then he would wail to himself, and utter sad
words of shame, which they never thought had reached his ears. By day, he was in general grave
and quiet; but his appetite varied, and he was evidently afraid of going into the streets,
dreading to be pointed at as an object of remark. Each separately in their hearts longed to
give him change of scene, but they were all silent, for where was the requisite money to come from?

This is an atom: 
His temper became fitful and variable. At times he would be most sullen against his mother;
and then give way to a passionate remorse. When Mr Benson caught Ruth's look of agony at her
child's rebuffs, his patience failed; or rather, I should say, he believed that a stronger,
severer hand than hers was required for the management of the lad. But, when she heard Mr Benson
say so, she pleaded with him.

This is an atom: 
"Have patience with Leonard," she said. "I have deserved the anger that is fretting in his
heart. It is only I who can reinstate myself in his love and respect. I have no fear. When
he sees me really striving hard and long to do what is right, he must love me. I am not afraid."

This is an atom: 
Even while she spoke, her lips quivered, and her colour went and came with eager anxiety. So
Mr Benson held his peace, and let her take her course. It was beautiful to see the intuition
by which she divined what was passing in every fold of her child's heart, so as to be always
ready with the right words to soothe or to strengthen him. Her watchfulness was unwearied,
and with no thought of self-tainting in it, or else she might have often paused to turn aside
and weep at the clouds of shame which came over Leonard's love for her, and hid it from all
but her faithful heart; she believed and knew that he was yet her own affectionate boy, although
he might be gloomily silent, or apparently hard and cold. And in all this, Mr Benson could
not choose but admire the way in which she was insensibly teaching Leonard to conform to the
law of right, to recognise Duty in the mode in which every action was performed. When Mr Benson
saw this, he knew that all goodness would follow, and that the claims which his mother's infinite
love had on the boy's heart would be acknowledged at last, and all the more fully because she
herself never urged them, but silently admitted the force of the reason that caused them to
be for a time forgotten. By-and-by Leonard's remorse at his ungracious and sullen ways to his
mother--ways that alternated with passionate, fitful bursts of clinging love--assumed more
the character of repentance; he tried to do so no more. But still his health was delicate;
he was averse to going out-of-doors; he was much graver and sadder than became his age. It
was what must be, an inevitable consequence of what had been; and Ruth had to be patient, and
pray in secret, and with many tears, for the strength she needed.

This is an atom: 
She knew what it was to dread the going out into the streets after her story had become known.
For days and days she had silently shrunk from this effort. But one evening towards dusk, Miss
Benson was busy, and asked her to go an errand for her; and Ruth got up and silently obeyed
her. That silence as to inward suffering was only one part of her peculiar and exquisite sweetness
of nature; part of the patience with which she "accepted her penance." Her true instincts told
her that it was not right to disturb others with many expressions of her remorse; that the
holiest repentance consisted in a quiet and daily sacrifice. Still there were times when she
wearied pitifully of her inaction. She was so willing to serve and work, and every one despised
her services. Her mind, as I have said before, had been well cultivated during these last few
years; so now she used all the knowledge she had gained in teaching Leonard, which was an employment
that Mr Benson relinquished willingly, because he felt that it would give her some of the occupation
that she needed. She endeavoured to make herself useful in the house in every way she could;
but the waters of housekeeping had closed over her place during the time of her absence at
Mr Bradshaw's--and, besides, now that they were trying to restrict every unnecessary expense,
it was sometimes difficult to find work for three women. Many and many a time Ruth turned over
in her mind every possible chance of obtaining employment for her leisure hours, and nowhere
could she find it. Now and then Sally, who was her confidante in this wish, procured her some
needlework, but it was of a coarse and common kind, soon done, lightly paid for. But whatever
it was, Ruth took it, and was thankful, although it added but a few pence to the household
purse. I do not mean that there was any great need of money; but a new adjustment of expenditure
was required--a reduction of wants which had never been very extravagant.

This is an atom: 
Ruth's salary of forty pounds was gone, while more of her "keep," as Sally called it, was thrown
upon the Bensons. Mr Benson received about eighty pounds a year for his salary as minister.
Of this, he knew that twenty pounds came from Mr Bradshaw; and when the old man appointed to
collect the pew-rents brought him the quarterly amount, and he found no diminution in them,
he inquired how it was, and learnt that, although Mr Bradshaw had expressed to the collector
his determination never to come to chapel again, he had added, that of course his pew-rent
should be paid all the same. But this Mr Benson could not suffer; and the old man was commissioned
to return the money to Mr Bradshaw, as being what his deserted minister could not receive.

This is an atom: 
Mr and Miss Benson had about thirty or forty pounds coming in annually from a sum which, in
happier days, Mr Bradshaw had invested in Canal shares for them. Altogether their income did
not fall much short of a hundred a year, and they lived in the Chapel-house free of rent. So
Ruth's small earnings were but very little in actual hard commercial account, though in another
sense they were much; and Miss Benson always received them with quiet simplicity. By degrees,
Mr Benson absorbed some of Ruth's time in a gracious and natural way. He employed her mind
in all the kind offices he was accustomed to render to the poor around him. And as much of
the peace and ornament of life as they gained now, was gained on a firm basis of truth. If
Ruth began low down to find her place in the world, at any rate there was no flaw in the foundation.

This is an atom: 
Leonard was still their great anxiety. At times the question seemed to be, could he live through
all this trial of the elasticity of childhood? And then they knew how precious a blessing--how
true a pillar of fire, he was to his mother; and how black the night, and how dreary the wilderness
would be, when he was not. The child and the mother were each messengers of God--angels to
each other.

This is an atom: 
They had long gaps between the pieces of intelligence respecting the Bradshaws. Mr Bradshaw
had at length purchased the house at Abermouth, and they were much there. The way in which
the Bensons heard most frequently of the family of their former friends, was through Mr Farquhar.
He called on Mr Benson about a month after the latter had met Jemima in the street. Mr Farquhar
was not in the habit of paying calls on any one; and though he had always entertained and evinced
the most kind and friendly feeling towards Mr Benson, he had rarely been in the Chapel-house.
Mr Benson received him courteously, but he rather expected that there would be some especial
reason alleged, before the conclusion of the visit, for its occurrence; more particularly as
Mr Farquhar sat talking on the topics of the day in a somewhat absent manner, as if they were
not the subjects most present to his mind. The truth was, he could not help recurring to the
last time when he was in that room, waiting to take Leonard a ride, and his heart beating rather
more quickly than usual at the idea that Ruth might bring the boy in when he was equipped.
He was very full now of the remembrance of Ruth; and yet he was also most thankful, most self-gratulatory,
that he had gone no further in his admiration of her--that he had never expressed his regard
in words--that no one, as he believed, was cognisant of the incipient love which had grown
partly out of his admiration, and partly out of his reason. He was thankful to be spared any
implication in the nine-days' wonder which her story had made in Eccleston. And yet his feeling
for her had been of so strong a character, that he winced, as with extreme pain, at every application
of censure to her name. These censures were often exaggerated, it is true; but when they were
just in their judgment of the outward circumstances of the case, they were not the less painful
and distressing to him. LETTER XIX.

Tangiers, January 12th, 1806.

This is an atom: 
I have long felt very desirous to visit a country, which, notwithstanding the many revolutions
it has undergone, and the enlightened characters of its conquerors,
is regarded as still immersed in a degree of barbarism almost
unparalleled.

This is an atom: 
It appeared to me next to impossible that a nation so contiguous to Europe, with which it has
for centuries maintained a constant intercourse, could have remained in a state of such profound
ignorance.

This is an atom: 
Impressed with these ideas, I readily embraced the offer of a friend to accompany him from
Gibraltar to this place, intending to travel further up the country, should I meet with
sufficient inducement from the result of my observations here. We landed on the first of
this month, and the intermediate time I have employed in obtaining information relative to
the town of Tangiers from the earliest tradition to the present
time.

This is an atom: 
As the particulars I have collected do not appear devoid of Interest, I flatter myself, you
will be gratified that I should have made them the subject of a letter.

This is an atom: 
This town, which by the ancients was called _Tingis_, or Tingir,
and appears to have been the metropolis of the _Western Mauritania_,
or Tingitania, as it was named, to distinguish it from _Mauritania
Caesariensis_; according to Pliny and others, was first founded ed
fay _Antaeus_ (about a thousand years before Christ), the same who
was afterwards conquered and slain by _Hercules_.

This is an atom: 
The giant is supposed to have been buried here: and the report of Plutarch, that his tomb was
opened by Sertorius, and a corpse sixty cubits or more in length, taken out of it, confirms
the idea.

This is an atom: 
But according to others, _Tingis_, or the present _Tangiers_, lays claim to a more ancient
founder than _Antaeus_.

This is an atom: 
Procopius mentions, that in his time were standing two pillars of white stone, upon which
were inscribed in the Phoenician characters the following words: _"We are the Canaanites who
fed from Joshua, the son of Nun

This is an atom: 
."_

This is an atom: 
A colony of Carthaginians settled here, and it is most probable
that a flourishing trade was carried on by them, as the situation
of Tangiers is extremely well adapted for that purpose.

This is an atom: 
Indeed the name _Tingis_, in the language of the Phoenicians and
Carthaginians, signifies an _emporium_.

This is an atom: 
When the Mauritaniae became subject to the Romans, in the reign of Julius Caesar, Bocchus,
the son-in-law of Jugurtha, having defeated Bogud, the king of
_Mauritania Tingitania_, he became possessed of that country, and
Augustus, or, as some say, Octavius, confirmed this acquisition to
him; and the inhabitants of _Tingis_ were allowed the privileges
of Roman citizens.

This is an atom: 
I cannot discover any thing further remarkable of Tangiers from the
time it became a Roman colony, and during the period it was possessed
by the Saracens, till the latter end of the fourteenth century,
when it was taken by the Portuguese, who erected fortifications and
other public works.

This is an atom: 
It continued in their possession for nearly two centuries; and was at length given to our
King, Charles the Second, as part of the dowry of his consort
Catharine, We did not keep it long; for, owing to the little harmony
that subsisted between that Monarch and his Parliament, it was ceded
to the Moors in 1684, after we had blown up all the fortifications,
and utterly destroyed the harbour.

This is an atom: 
Since that event, it seems to have been gradually dwindling into its present insignificance.

This is an atom: 
I have before observed, that the situation of Tangiers is well
adapted to the purposes of commerce, being about two miles within
the Straits of Gibraltar (or Hercules); but the ruins of the
fortifications and harbour have rendered the anchorage in the bay
of Tangiers very unsafe.

This is an atom: 
This is a great obstacle to trade; very little is carried on there at present, and that little
is by a few Jews, and lately, by a Spanish merchant of the name of Don Pedro.

This is an atom: 
The town being built on the declivity of that high tract of land called Cape Spartel (the Cape
_Cottes_ or _Ampelusian_ of the ancients), it is seen at a great
distance; but on entering the bay, it appears to the best advantage.

This is an atom: 
It is defended by two martello towers, a castle, and a large battery;
but I am confident that it could not withstand the attack of a few
English frigates, and that such a force from the bay might destroy
the town in the space of a few hours.

This is an atom: 
Notwithstanding the vicissitudes to which this place has been exposed, it still possesses a
superiority over the other towns in the empire of Morocco; it is
the capital of the kingdom, and the residence of the Consuls General
of the powers in amity with his Imperial Majesty.

This is an atom: 
The houses of these foreign residents are constructed with great taste in the European style;
the habitations of the Moors are neat; the air is pure and salubrious; the supply of excellent
water, abundant; and the market cheap and plentiful. This combination of advantages renders
Tangiers, in many points of view, an eligible residence.

This is an atom: 
The European society, which consists almost solely of the families of the foreign consuls,
is pleasant and agreable, The adjacent country is beautifully
romantic; and the opposite coast and bay present a most delightful
prospect.

This is an atom: 
The Moorish inhabitants are all soldiers, very poor, and entirely subject to the arbitrary will
of the Emperor. It is capable of furnishing, at a moment's warning, three thousand cavalry,
and two thousand infantry and artillery-men; but these troops are badly trained, and without
order or discipline: I attended their evening parade yesterday,
and was truly diverted with the sorry appearance of their best
militia-men, who were to mount guard for the night.

This is an atom: 
These Moorish soldiers are remarkably addicted to cheating. It is probably owing to their
excessive indolence, which prevents them from making the usual
exertions for obtaining a livelihood, and induces them to adopt the
more expeditious mode of extorting from strangers the means of
subsistence; but as they are not often presented with an object of
prey, they continually labour against the pressure of extreme
poverty.

This is an atom: 
Tangiers is under the government of Sidy Ash-Ash; who resides at Tetuan. He is by no means
partial to the English, but devoted to France; influenced by French principles, and French
interest.

This is an atom: 
Excepting a few small armed vessels, fitted out for piracy, there is no shipping in the harbour. I
have observed none for the purpose of commerce; all their goods are exported in foreign bottoms;
and when they bring in a prize, the vessel remains unsold for a considerable length of time,
and it is always disposed of to a foreign merchant.

This is an atom: 
Several remains of the European fortifications are yet visible; the
Moors have repaired some, among which the western bastions still
form a principal part of the strength of the place.

This is an atom: 
The castle, which appears to have been built before the time of the Portuguese, stands in a
commanding position upon one of the most prominent rocks of this coast. By an order of the
Emperor, all the civil and military officers of this town are obliged to reside in it.

This is an atom: 
From this castle is a subterraneous passage containing many curious remnants of antiquity.
On each side of the passage are ruinous apartments, which we may readily suppose to have been
designed as places for the concealment of treasures, or receptacles for the dead. From the
fragments of some urns I have collected, upon which are to be traced parts of inscriptions in the
Punic character, I imagine this subterraneous place to have been built by the Carthaginians,
for one or both of those purposes. It extends from the castle to several miles without the
gates of the town; whence we may likewise infer, that it served as a means of escape in
case of a sudden insurrection, or siege. Here are several superb mosques and commodious
public baths.

This is an atom: 
The _Socco_, or market, is held twice a week (on Sunday and Wednesday), in a spacious sandy
square, outside of the western gate, whereto the peasants bring all kinds of provisions, and
other necessaries, which are sold at very low rates. Fish and every sort of wild fowl are
brought in daily, and sold very cheap.

This is an atom: 
Among the Consuls' villas, some of which are built near the spot
where the _Socco_ is held, that of the Swedish Consul is the most
worthy of notice.

This is an atom: 
The pleasure-ground is laid out with great taste in orange groves;
the gardens abound in fruit-trees, and the Consul has made a curious
botanical collection.

This is an atom: 
I have just been interrupted by Mr. Matra, our Consul. He called to request me to go up to
Larache, to attend the Governor, who is dangerously ill, and has sent here for an English physician.

This is an atom: 
I intended to have continued a brief account of this empire, from the time it became a Roman
province to the introduction of Mahometanism; also by what means the Moors became mixed with Arabs:
but I must reserve this for the next opportunity.

Larache, January 1806.

This is an atom: 
Before I proceed to give you the particulars of my journey to this place, I shall fulfil tho
promise I made you in my last.

This is an atom: 
The present empire of Morocco is properly the _Mauritania Tingitania_ of the Romans, as the
_Mauritania Caesariensis_ comprised Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis; and was so called from the Emperor
Claudius. _Tingitania_ was not decidedly reduced to a Roman province till after the death of
_Bocchus_. Augustus afterwards gave the two Mauritanias, and a part of _Getulia_, to the
younger _Juba_, as a remuneration for the loss of his father's kingdom (_Numidia_).
_Ptolemy_, his son, by _Cleopatra_ (daughter of _Antony_ and _Cleopatra_), succeeded him. In his
reign, the Moors of this country were induced to revolt by a Numidian named _Tacfarinas_,
who had served in the Roman army, and who, at the head of a set of barbarians accustomed to
every species of robbery, assisted the revolt he had excited.

This is an atom: 
After a variety of successes and defeats, they were completely routed by _Dolabella_, the
Roman General, and a body of Mauritanians sent to his assistance by _Ptolemy_, This conquest
contributed to establish peace for a short time in these provinces; but at the death of _Ptolemy_
(who was treacherously cut off by _Caius_), they again revolted, when _Claudius_ first fixed
a Roman army in _Mauritania_.

This is an atom: 
His generals, though not without difficulty, succeeded in restoring tranquillity, which
scarcely met with any interruption till the latter end of the fifth century, when the declining state
of the Roman power favoured another revolt, in which the Moors entirely shook off the yoke
of the Romans, assisted by the Vandals, under _Genseric_, who overran Africa, and obtained
possession of most of the maritime towns. The Vandals were expelled in the seventh century by the
Saracens, under the Caliphs of Bagdad, a ferocious and warlike race of Arabs, who, from
conquest to conquest, had extended and removed their seat of government from Medina to the
city of Damascus; thence to _Cufa_, and from the latter place to _Bagdad_; where they established
their Caliphate authority.

This is an atom: 
Flushed with their success, and burning with the hopes of plunder, in the conquest of countries
more fertile and richer, but less warlike than their own, they extended their arms as far
as the western _Mauritania_. This country then remained for some time subject to the Caliphs
of Bagdad, and was governed by their lieutenants, a set of cruel, arbitrary, and rapacious
men.

This is an atom: 
The distance from the seat of government, and the oppressive manner in which the Caliphs ruled,
excited universal commotion in this part, and considerably diminished their authority. Their
generals, far from suppressing, openly encouraged these tumults, and severally aspired to
the sovereignty.

This is an atom: 
In the midst of these intestine broils, _Edris_, a descendant of
Mahomet, fled into Mauritania, to avoid the persecutions of the
Caliph _Abdallah_, who, to ensure the succession to his own family,
had caused the kinsmen of _Edris_ to be put to death.

This is an atom: 
_Edris_ first settled in a mountain, between Fez and Mequinez, called _Zaaron_, where he
soon gained the confidence of the Moors.

This is an atom: 
He preached the doctrine of Mahomet, and, by degrees, succeeded in
establishing it throughout the country.

This is an atom: 
These people, fond of novelty, and extremely susceptible of fanaticism, readily embraced a
faith so well suited to their manners and inclinations.

This is an atom: 
They elected him their chief, and invested him with supreme power; which he employed in
reducing the Arab generals.

This is an atom: 
From that time, the characters of the Moors and Arabs gradually
blended, so that in after-ages, among the generality of them,
scarcely any distinction can be traced.

This is an atom: 
As it is foreign to my present purpose to carry you farther into the ancient history of this
country, I shall proceed to give you tho particulars of my journey
to this town.

This is an atom: 
I left Tangiers, escorted by a guard, consisting of a serjeant and
six horsemen, accompanied by an interpreter, and my few servants.

This is an atom: 
We rode for several hours, alternately through gardens and woods:
the former full of fruit-trees; such as orange, lemon, fig,
pomegranate, apple, pear, and cherry trees.

This is an atom: 
The scene became every moment more interesting. As we advanced, the country assumed a variety
almost indescribable. The contrast was every where infinitely
striking.

This is an atom: 
At one instant the eye was presented with fine corn-fields, meadows,
and high hills; nay, mountains, cultivated to the very summits, are
covered with immense flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle; while
the vallies conveyed to the imagination an idea of the fertile
plains of Arcadia; the simple manners of the Moors, who tend these
flocks and herds, still further inducing one to believe them the
happy, peaceful people, the poets feign the Arcadian swains to have
been.

This is an atom: 
On the other hand are huge mountains, bleak and barren, inaccessible to man, and scarcely affording
food to the straggling wild goats that venture to browse on them.

This is an atom: 
There is a degree of simplicity in the behaviour of the peasants,
so widely different from these who inhabit the towns, that it is
impossible to suppose them the same race of men.

This is an atom: 
From the great affinity between the manners and customs of these country Moors, and the _Scenite
Arabs_, the inhabitants of _Arabia Deserta_, we may naturally infer that they must have
derived those habits from the latter.

This is an atom: 
They reside in villages composed of tents to the number of forty or fifty, which they remove at
pleasure; when the pasture fails in one valley, they strike their
tents, and seek another, where they remain till the same necessity
impels them to quit that in its turn.

This is an atom: 
This was precisely the custom of the _Arabes Scenitae_.

This is an atom: 
The vast plains of sand with which _Arabia Deserta_ abounds, were occasionally interspersed with
fertile spots, which appeared like little islands. These we're rendered extremely delightful
by fountains, rivulets, palm-trees, and most excellent fruit.

This is an atom: 
The Arabs, with their flocks, encamped on some of them, and when they had consumed every thing
there, they retired to others.

This is an atom: 
Their descendants, the present _Bedoweens_, continue the practice to this day. The name given
to this kind of village is the same as that of the Arabs just mentioned, which is _Dow-war, or
Hbyma_.

This is an atom: 
The families of the Moorish peasants appear to be very numerous, as I observed that each
tent was quite full.

This is an atom: 
They flocked out as I passed, to gratify their curiosity in seeing a _Massarane_ (for so they
denominate a Christian). Yet, notwithstanding their antipathy to
all Christians, I was received with the greatest hospitality by
these followers of Mahomet.

This is an atom: 
They seemed to vie with each other in presenting the bowl of butter-milk, which they consider
as a great delicacy, and. indeed, an offering of peace.

This is an atom: 
In the centre of a plain, about eight hours journey from Tangiers, we halted, and refreshed
ourselves. After allowing my serjeant and guard to perform their ablutions, and say their
prayers, we proceeded on our journey, and arrived, very late in the evening, at a village
on the banks of a large river, which, from its situation, I imagine to be the _Zelis_, or
_Zelia_, of the ancients, and which, by its annual inundation, fertilizes and enriches the
country to such a degree, that, with very little labour, it produces abundant crops of all
kinds of grain, particularly of wheat and barley.

This is an atom: 
A number of rivulets have their source in those mountains, which, joining others in their
course, at length form pretty considerable rivers; and these, meeting with obstacles from the
projecting rocks over which they pass, produce most beautiful natural cascades, which,
precipitating themselves into the plains, preserve so great a moisture in the soil, that it is
covered with a continual verdure.

This is an atom: 
There are no public inns for the accommodation of travellers on the
road; but the Emperor has caused stone buildings to be erected, at
certain distances, as substitutes. These buildings are not so good
as many of the stables in England; they resemble the sheds, made,
by farmers, to-give shelter to their cattle in tempestuous weather:
yet, miserable as they were, I was glad to accept the offer of a
night's lodging in one of them, not having provided myself with a
tent.
The Cadi of the village conducted us to this delectable abode, which
we found already occupied by six Moorish wanderers, who, in the
Emperor's name, were ordered to turn out, and make room for me and
my suite. Supper was brought me by the Cadi; it consisted, of boiled
rice and milk, and some fresh-water fish, tolerably well dressed.
When I had partaken of this homely repast, I prepared myself for
rest, of which I stood in great need from the fatigues of the day;
but, alas! my evil genius had determined otherwise; it seemed as
if all the fleas and bugs in His Imperial Majesty's dominions had
been collected, to prevent my closing my eyes; or it was, possibly,
a legacy bequeathed, me by my predecessors. Be that as it may, I
found them such very troublesome companions, that I preferred the
night air to the prospect of being devoured before morning; I
therefore wrapped myself up in a thick blanket, and slept, unmolested,
in the open air, till after daybreak, when I found myself sufficiently
refreshed to pursue my journey. Crossing the river, we passed through
a ruinous walled town, called _Arzilla_, commanded by an Alcaid,
under the Governor of Larache. This, which is a maritime town, lies
at the mouth of the above river, and was, according to Strabo,
Pliny, and others, a _Phoenician colony_; it was afterwards
successively in the hands of the Romans, Vandals, Arabs, and occupied
by _Aphonso_, King of Portugal, surnamed the _African_.He did not mope and
pine over his lessons; they were the one thing that took him out of himself. As yet his mother
could teach him, though in some respects it was becoming a strain upon her acquirements and
powers. Mr Benson saw this, but reserved his offers of help as long as he could, hoping that
before his assistance became absolutely necessary, some mode of employment beyond that of occasional
plain-work might be laid open to Ruth.

This is an atom: 
In spite of the communication they occasionally had with Mr Farquhar, when he gave them the
intelligence of his engagement to Jemima, it seemed like a glimpse into a world from which
they were shut out. They wondered--Miss Benson and Ruth did at least--much about the details.
Ruth sat over her sewing, fancying how all had taken place; and as soon as she had arranged
the events which were going on among people and places once so familiar to her, she found some
discrepancy, and set-to afresh to picture the declaration of love, and the yielding, blushing
acceptance; for Mr Farquhar had told little beyond the mere fact that there was an engagement
between himself and Jemima which had existed for some time, but which had been kept secret
until now, when it was acknowledged, sanctioned, and to be fulfilled as soon as he returned
from an arrangement of family affairs in Scotland. This intelligence had been enough for Mr
Benson, who was the only person Mr Farquhar saw; as Ruth always shrank from the post of opening
the door, and Mr Benson was apt at recognising individual knocks, and always prompt to welcome
Mr Farquhar.

This is an atom: 
Miss Benson occasionally thought--and what she thought she was in the habit of saying--that
Jemima might have come herself to announce such an event to old friends; but Mr Benson decidedly
vindicated her from any charge of neglect, by expressing his strong conviction that to her
they owed Mr Farquhar's calls--his all but outspoken offers of service--his quiet, steady interest
in Leonard; and, moreover (repeating the conversation he had had with her in the street, the
first time they met after the disclosure), Mr Benson told his sister how glad he was to find
that, with all the warmth of her impetuous disposition hurrying her on to rebellion against
her father, she was now attaining to that just self-control which can distinguish between mere
wishes and true reasons--that she could abstain from coming to see Ruth while she could do
but little good, reserving herself for some great occasion or strong emergency.

This is an atom: 
Ruth said nothing, but she yearned all the more in silence to see Jemima. In her recollection
of that fearful interview with Mr Bradshaw, which haunted her yet, sleeping or waking, she
was painfully conscious that she had not thanked Jemima for her generous, loving advocacy;
it had passed unregarded at the time in intensity of agony--but now she recollected that by
no word, or tone, or touch, had she given any sign of gratitude. Mr Benson had never told her
of his meeting with Jemima; so it seemed as if there were no hope of any future opportunity:
for it is strange how two households, rent apart by some dissension, can go through life, their
parallel existences running side by side, yet never touching each other, near neighbours as
they are, habitual and familiar guests as they may have been.

This is an atom: 
Ruth's only point of hope was Leonard. She was weary of looking for work and employment, which
everywhere seemed held above her reach. She was not impatient of this, but she was very, very
sorry. She felt within her such capability, and all ignored her, and passed her by on the other
side. But she saw some progress in Leonard. Not that he could continue to have the happy development,
and genial ripening, which other boys have; leaping from childhood to boyhood, and thence to
youth, with glad bounds, and unconsciously enjoying every age. At present there was no harmony
in Leonard's character; he was as full of thought and self-consciousness as many men, planning
his actions long beforehand, so as to avoid what he dreaded, and what she could not yet give
him strength to face, coward as she was herself, and shrinking from hard remarks. Yet Leonard
was regaining some of his lost tenderness towards his mother; when they were alone he would
throw himself on her neck and smother her with kisses, without any apparent cause for such
a passionate impulse. If any one was by, his manner was cold and reserved. The hopeful parts
of his character were the determination evident in him to be a "law unto himself," and the
serious thought which he gave to the formation of this law. There was an inclination in him
to reason, especially and principally with Mr Benson, on the great questions of ethics which
the majority of the world have settled long ago. But I do not think he ever so argued with
his mother. Her lovely patience, and her humility, was earning its reward; and from her quiet
piety, bearing sweetly the denial of her wishes--the refusal of her begging--the disgrace in
which she lay, while others, less worthy, were employed--this, which perplexed him, and almost
angered him at first, called out his reverence at last, and what she said he took for his law
with proud humility; and thus softly, she was leading him up to God. His health was not strong;
it was not likely to be. He moaned and talked in his sleep, and his appetite was still variable,
part of which might be owing to his preference of the hardest lessons to any outdoor exercise.
But this last unnatural symptom was vanishing before the assiduous kindness of Mr Farquhar,
and the quiet but firm desire of his mother. Next to Ruth, Sally had perhaps the most influence
over him; but he dearly loved both Mr and Miss Benson; although he was reserved on this, as
on every point not purely intellectual. His was a hard childhood, and his mother felt that
it was so. Children bear any moderate degree of poverty and privation cheerfully; but, in addition
to a good deal of this, Leonard had to bear a sense of disgrace attaching to him and to the
creature he loved best; this it was that took out of him the buoyancy and natural gladness
of youth, in a way which no scantiness of food or clothing, or want of any outward comfort,
could ever have done.

This is an atom: 
Two years had passed away--two long, eventless years. Something was now going to happen, which
touched their hearts very nearly, though out of their sight and hearing. Jemima was going to
be married this August, and by-and-by the very day was fixed. It was to be on the 14th. On
the evening of the 13th, Ruth was sitting alone in the parlour, idly gazing out on the darkening
shadows in the little garden; her eyes kept filling with quiet tears, that rose, not for her
own isolation from all that was going on of bustle and preparation for the morrow's event,
but because she had seen how Miss Benson had felt that she and her brother were left out from
the gathering of old friends in the Bradshaw family. As Ruth sat, suddenly she was aware of
a figure by her; she started up, and in the gloom of the apartment she recognised Jemima. In
an instant they were in each other's arms--a long, fast embrace.

This is an atom: 
"Can you forgive me?" whispered Jemima in Ruth's ear.

This is an atom: 
"Forgive you! What do you mean? What have I to forgive? The question is, can I ever thank you
as I long to do, if I could find words?"

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Ruth, how I hated you once!"

This is an atom: 
"It was all the more noble in you to stand by me as you did. You must have hated me when you
knew how I was deceiving you all!"

This is an atom: 
"No, that was not it that made me hate you. It was before that. Oh, Ruth, I did hate you!"

This is an atom: 
They were silent for some time, still holding each other's hands. Ruth spoke first.

This is an atom: 
"And you are going to be married to-morrow!"

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said Jemima. "To-morrow, at nine o'clock. But I don't think I could have been married
without coming to wish Mr Benson and Miss Faith good-bye."

This is an atom: 
"I will go for them," said Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"No, not just yet. I want to ask you one or two questions first. Nothing very particular; only
it seems as if there had been such a strange, long separation between us. Ruth," said she,
dropping her voice, "is Leonard stronger than he was? I was so sorry to hear about him from
Walter. But he is better?" asked she, anxiously.

This is an atom: 
"Yes, he is better. Not what a boy of his age should be," replied his mother, in a tone of
quiet but deep mournfulness. "Oh, Jemima!" continued she, "my sharpest punishment comes through
him. To think what he might have been, and what he is!"

This is an atom: 
"But Walter says he is both stronger in health, and not so--nervous and shy." Jemima added
the last words in a hesitating and doubtful manner, as if she did not know how to express her
full meaning without hurting Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"He does not show that he feels his disgrace so much. I cannot talk about it, Jemima, my heart
aches so about him. But he is better," she continued, feeling that Jemima's kind anxiety required
an answer at any cost of pain to herself. "He is only studying too closely now; he takes to
his lessons evidently as a relief from thought. He is very clever, and I hope and trust, yet
I tremble to say it, I believe he is very good."

This is an atom: 
"You must let him come and see us very often when we come back. We shall be two months away.
We are going to Germany, partly on Walter's business. Ruth, I have been talking to papa to-night,
very seriously and quietly, and it has made me love him so much more, and understand him so
much better."

This is an atom: 
"Does he know of your coming here? I hope he does," said Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"Yes. Not that he liked my doing it at all. But, somehow, I can always do things against a
person's wishes more easily when I am on good terms with them--that's not exactly what I meant;
but now to-night, after papa had been showing me that he really loved me more than I ever thought
he had done (for I always fancied he was so absorbed in Dick, he did not care much for us girls),
I felt brave enough to say that I intended to come here and bid you all good-bye. He was silent
for a minute, and then said I might do it, but I must remember he did not approve of it, and
was not to be compromised by my coming; still I can tell that, at the bottom of his heart,
there is some of the old kindly feeling to Mr and Miss Benson, and I don't despair of its all
being made up, though, perhaps, I ought to say that mamma does."

This is an atom: 
"Mr and Miss Benson won't hear of my going away," said Ruth, sadly.

This is an atom: 
"They are quite right."

This is an atom: 
"But I am earning nothing. I cannot get any employment. I am only a burden and an expense."

This is an atom: 
"Are you not also a pleasure? And Leonard, is he not a dear object of love? It is easy for
me to talk, I know, who am so impatient. Oh, I never deserved to be so happy as I am! You don't
know how good Walter is. I used to think him so cold and cautious. But now, Ruth, will you
tell Mr and Miss Benson that I am here? There is signing of papers, and I don't know what to
be done at home. And when I come back, I hope to see you often, if you'll let me."

This is an atom: 
Mr and Miss Benson gave her a warm greeting. Sally was called in, and would bring a candle
with her, to have a close inspection of her, in order to see if she was changed--she had not
seen her for so long a time, she said; and Jemima stood laughing and blushing in the middle
of the room, while Sally studied her all over, and would not be convinced that the old gown
which she was wearing for the last time was not one of the new wedding ones. The consequence
of which misunderstanding was, that Sally, in her short petticoats and bedgown, turned up her
nose at the old-fashioned way in which Miss Bradshaw's gown was made. But Jemima knew the old
woman, and rather enjoyed the contempt for her dress. At last she kissed them all, and ran
away to her impatient Mr Farquhar, who was awaiting her.

This is an atom: 
Not many weeks after this, the poor old woman whom I have named as having become a friend of
Ruth's, during Leonard's illness three years ago, fell down and broke her hip-bone. It was
a serious--probably a fatal injury, for one so old; and as soon as Ruth heard of it she devoted
all her leisure time to old Ann Fleming. Leonard had now outstript his mother's powers of teaching,
and Mr Benson gave him his lessons; so Ruth was a great deal at the cottage both night and day.

This is an atom: 
There Jemima found her one November evening, the second after their return from their prolonged
stay on the Continent. She and Mr Farquhar had been to the Bensons, and had sat there some
time; and now Jemima had come on just to see Ruth for five minutes, before the evening was
too dark for her to return alone. She found Ruth sitting on a stool before the fire, which
was composed of a few sticks on the hearth. The blaze they gave was, however, enough to enable
her to read; and she was deep in study of the Bible, in which she had read aloud to the poor
old woman, until the latter had fallen asleep. Jemima beckoned her out, and they stood on the
green just before the open door, so that Ruth could see if Ann awoke.

This is an atom: 
"I have not many minutes to stay, only I felt as if I must see you. And we want Leonard to
come to us to see all our German purchases, and hear all our German adventures. May he come
to-morrow?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes; thank you. Oh! Jemima, I have heard something--I have got a plan that makes me so happy!
I have not told any one yet. But Mr Wynne (the parish doctor, you know) has asked me if I would
go out as a sick nurse--he thinks he could find me employment."

This is an atom: 
"You, a sick nurse!" said Jemima, involuntarily glancing over the beautiful lithe figure, and
the lovely refinement of Ruth's face as the light of the rising moon fell upon it. "My dear
Ruth, I don't think you are fitted for it!"

This is an atom: 
"Don't you?" said Ruth, a little disappointed. "I think I am; at least, that I should be very
soon. I like being about sick and helpless people; I always feel so sorry for them; and then
I think I have the gift of a very delicate touch, which is such a comfort in many cases. And
I should try to be very watchful and patient. Mr Wynne proposed it himself."

This is an atom: 
"It was not in that way I meant you were not fitted for it. I meant that you were fitted for
something better. Why, Ruth, you are better educated than I am!"

This is an atom: 
"But if nobody will allow me to teach?--for that is what I suppose you mean. Besides, I feel
as if all my education would be needed to make me a good sick nurse."

This is an atom: 
"Your knowledge of Latin, for instance," said Jemima, hitting, in her vexation at the plan,
on the first acquirement of Ruth she could think of.

This is an atom: 
"Well!" said Ruth, "that won't come amiss; I can read the prescriptions."

This is an atom: 
"Which the doctors would rather you did not do."

This is an atom: 
"Still, you can't say that any knowledge of any kind will be in my way, or will unfit me for
my work."

This is an atom: 
"Perhaps not. But all your taste and refinement will be in your way, and will unfit you."

This is an atom: 
"You have not thought about this so much as I have, or you would not say so. Any fastidiousness
I shall have to get rid of, and I shall be better without; but any true refinement I am sure
I shall find of use; for don't you think that every power we have may be made to help us in
any right work, whatever that is? Would you not rather be nursed by a person who spoke gently
and moved quietly about than by a loud bustling woman?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes, to be sure; but a person unfit for anything else may move quietly, and speak gently,
and give medicine when the doctor orders it, and keep awake at night; and those are the best
qualities I ever heard of in a sick nurse."

This is an atom: 
Ruth was quite silent for some time. At last she said: "At any rate it is work, and as such
I am thankful for it. You cannot discourage me--and perhaps you know too little of what my
life has been--how set apart in idleness I have been--to sympathise with me fully."

This is an atom: 
"And I wanted you to come to see us--me in my new home. Walter and I had planned that we would
persuade you to come to us very often" (she had planned, and Mr Farquhar had consented); "and
now you will have to be fastened up in a sick-room."

This is an atom: 
"I could not have come," said Ruth quickly. "Dear Jemima! it is like you to have thought of
it--but I could not come to your house. It is not a thing to reason about. It is just feeling.
But I do feel as if I could not go. Dear Jemima! if you are ill or sorrowful, and want me,
I will come--"

This is an atom: 
"So you would and must to any one, if you take up that calling."

This is an atom: 
"But I should come to you, love, in quite a different way; I should go to you with my heart
full of love--so full that I am afraid I should be too anxious."

This is an atom: 
"I almost wish I were ill, that I might make you come at once."

This is an atom: 
"And I am almost ashamed to think how I should like you to be in some position in which I could
show you how well I remember that day--that terrible day in the school-room. God bless you
for it, Jemima!"

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXX

This is an atom: 
The Forged Deed

This is an atom: 
Mr Wynne, the parish surgeon, was right. He could and did obtain employment for Ruth as a sick
nurse. Her home was with the Bensons; every spare moment was given to Leonard and to them;
but she was at the call of all the invalids in the town. At first her work lay exclusively
among the paupers. At first, too, there was a recoil from many circumstances, which impressed
upon her the most fully the physical sufferings of those whom she tended. But she tried to
lose the sense of these--or rather to lessen them, and make them take their appointed places--in
thinking of the individuals themselves, as separate from their decaying frames; and all along
she had enough self-command to control herself from expressing any sign of repugnance. She
allowed herself no nervous haste of movement or touch that should hurt the feelings of the
poorest, most friendless creature, who ever lay a victim to disease. There was no rough getting
over of all the disagreeable and painful work of her employment. When it was a lessening of
pain to have the touch careful and delicate, and the ministration performed with gradual skill,
Ruth thought of her charge, and not of herself. As she had foretold, she found a use for all
her powers. The poor patients themselves were unconsciously gratified and soothed by her harmony
and refinement of manner, voice, and gesture. If this harmony and refinement had been merely
superficial, it would not have had this balmy effect. That arose from its being the true expression
of a kind, modest, and humble spirit. By degrees her reputation as a nurse spread upwards,
and many sought her good offices who could well afford to pay for them. Whatever remuneration
was offered to her, she took it simply and without comment; for she felt that it was not hers
to refuse; that it was, in fact, owing to the Bensons for her and her child's subsistence.
She went wherever her services were first called for. If the poor bricklayer, who broke both
his legs in a fall from the scaffolding, sent for her when she was disengaged, she went and
remained with him until he could spare her, let who would be the next claimant. From the happy
and prosperous in all but health, she would occasionally beg off, when some one less happy
and more friendless wished for her; and sometimes she would ask for a little money from Mr
Benson to give to such in their time of need. But it was astonishing how much she was able
to do without money.

This is an atom: 
Her ways were very quiet; she never spoke much. Any one who has been oppressed with the weight
of a vital secret for years, and much more any one the character of whose life has been stamped
by one event, and that producing sorrow and shame, is naturally reserved. And yet Ruth's silence
was not like reserve; it was too gentle and tender for that. It had more the effect of a hush
of all loud or disturbing emotions, and out of the deep calm the words that came forth had
a beautiful power. She did not talk much about religion; but those who noticed her knew that
it was the unseen banner which she was following. The low-breathed sentences which she spoke
into the ear of the sufferer and the dying carried them upwards to God.

This is an atom: 
She gradually became known and respected among the roughest boys of the rough populace of the
town. They would make way for her when she passed along the streets with more deference than
they used to most; for all knew something of the tender care with which she had attended this
or that sick person, and, besides, she was so often in connexion with Death that something
of the superstitious awe with which the dead were regarded by those rough boys in the midst
of their strong life, surrounded her.

This is an atom: 
She herself did not feel changed. She felt just as faulty--as far from being what she wanted
to be, as ever. She best knew how many of her good actions were incomplete, and marred with
evil. She did not feel much changed from the earliest Ruth she could remember. Everything seemed
to change but herself. Mr and Miss Benson grew old, and Sally grew deaf, and Leonard was shooting
up, and Jemima was a mother. She and the distant hills that she saw from her chamber window,
seemed the only things which were the same as when she first came to Eccleston. As she sat
looking out, and taking her fill of solitude, which sometimes was her most thorough rest--as
she sat at the attic window looking abroad--she saw their next-door neighbour carried out to
sun himself in his garden. When she first came to Eccleston, this neighbour and his daughter
were often seen taking long and regular walks; by-and-by his walks became shorter, and the
attentive daughter would convoy him home, and set out afresh to finish her own. Of late years
he had only gone out in the garden behind his house; but at first he had walked pretty briskly
there by his daughter's help--now he was carried, and placed in a large, cushioned easy-chair,
his head remaining where it was placed against the pillow, and hardly moving when his kind
daughter, who was now middle-aged, brought him the first roses of the summer. This told Ruth
of the lapse of life and time.

This is an atom: 
Mr and Mrs Farquhar were constant in their attentions; but there was no sign of Mr Bradshaw
ever forgiving the imposition which had been practised upon him, and Mr Benson ceased to hope
for any renewal of their intercourse. Still, he thought that he must know of all the kind attentions
which Jemima paid to them, and of the fond regard which both she and her husband bestowed on
Leonard. This latter feeling even went so far that Mr Farquhar called one day, and with much
diffidence begged Mr Benson to urge Ruth to let him be sent to school at his (Mr Farquhar's)
expense.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson was taken by surprise, and hesitated. "I do not know. It would be a great advantage
in some respects; and yet I doubt whether it would in others. His mother's influence over him
is thoroughly good, and I should fear that any thoughtless allusions to his peculiar position
might touch the raw spot in his mind."

This is an atom: 
"But he is so unusually clever, it seems a shame not to give him all the advantages he can
have. Besides, does he see much of his mother now?"

This is an atom: 
"Hardly a day passes without her coming home to be an hour or so with him, even at her busiest
times; she says it is her best refreshment. And often, you know, she is disengaged for a week
or two, except the occasional services which she is always rendering to those who need her.
Your offer is very tempting, but there is so decidedly another view of the question to be considered,
that I believe we must refer it to her."

This is an atom: 
"With all my heart. Don't hurry her to a decision. Let her weigh it well. I think she will
find the advantages preponderate."

This is an atom: 
"I wonder if I might trouble you with a little business, Mr Farquhar, as you are here?"

This is an atom: 
"Certainly; I am only too glad to be of any use to you."

This is an atom: 
"Why, I see from the report of the Star Life Assurance Company in the _Times_, which you are
so good as to send me, that they have declared a bonus on the shares; now it seems strange
that I have received no notification of it, and I thought that perhaps it might be lying at
your office, as Mr Bradshaw was the purchaser of the shares, and I have always received the
dividends through your firm."

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar took the newspaper, and ran his eye over the report.

This is an atom: 
"I've no doubt that's the way of it," said he. "Some of our clerks have been careless about
it; or it may be Richard himself. He is not always the most punctual and exact of mortals;
but I'll see about it. Perhaps after all it mayn't come for a day or two; they have always
such numbers of these circulars to send out."

This is an atom: 
"Oh! I'm in no hurry about it. I only want to receive it some time before I incur any expenses,
which the promise of this bonus may tempt me to indulge in."

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar took his leave. That evening there was a long conference, for, as it happened,
Ruth was at home. She was strenuously against the school plan. She could see no advantages
that would counterbalance the evil which she dreaded from any school for Leonard; namely, that
the good opinion and regard of the world would assume too high an importance in his eyes. The
very idea seemed to produce in her so much shrinking affright, that by mutual consent the subject
was dropped; to be taken up again, or not, according to circumstances.

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar wrote the next morning, on Mr Benson's behalf, to the Insurance Company, to inquire
about the bonus. Although he wrote in the usual formal way, he did not think it necessary to
tell Mr Bradshaw what he had done; for Mr Benson's name was rarely mentioned between the partners;
each had been made fully aware of the views which the other entertained on the subject that
had caused the estrangement; and Mr Farquhar felt that no external argument could affect Mr
Bradshaw's resolved disapproval and avoidance of his former minister.

This is an atom: 
As it happened, the answer from the Insurance Company (directed to the firm) was given to Mr
Bradshaw along with the other business letters. It was to the effect that Mr Benson's shares
had been sold and transferred above a twelvemonth ago, which sufficiently accounted for the
circumstance that no notification of the bonus had been sent to him.

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw tossed the letter on one side, not displeased to have a good reason for feeling
a little contempt at the unbusiness-like forgetfulness of Mr Benson, at whose instance some
one had evidently been writing to the Insurance Company. On Mr Farquhar's entrance he expressed
this feeling to him.

This is an atom: 
"Really," he said, "these Dissenting ministers have no more notion of exactitude in their affairs
than a child! The idea of forgetting that he has sold his shares, and applying for the bonus,
when it seems he has transferred them only a year ago!"

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar was reading the letter while Mr Bradshaw spoke.

This is an atom: 
"I don't quite understand it," said he. "Mr Benson was quite clear about it. He could not have
received his half-yearly dividends unless he had been possessed of these shares; and I don't
suppose Dissenting ministers, with all their ignorance of business, are unlike other men in
knowing whether or not they receive the money that they believe to be owing to them."

This is an atom: 
"I should not wonder if they were--if Benson was, at any rate. Why, I never knew his watch
to be right in all my life--it was always too fast or too slow; it must have been a daily discomfort
to him. It ought to have been. Depend upon it, his money matters are just in the same irregular
state; no accounts kept, I'll be bound."

This is an atom: 
"I don't see that that follows," said Mr Farquhar, half amused. "That watch of his is a very
curious one--belonged to his father and grandfather, I don't know how far back."

This is an atom: 
"And the sentimental feelings which he is guided by prompt him to keep it, to the inconvenience
of himself and every one else."

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar gave up the subject of the watch as hopeless.

This is an atom: 
"But about this letter. I wrote, at Mr Benson's desire, to the Insurance Office, and I am not
satisfied with this answer. All the transaction has passed through our hands. I do not think
it is likely Mr Benson would write and sell the shares without, at any rate, informing us at
the time, even though he forgot all about it afterwards."

This is an atom: 
"Probably he told Richard, or Mr Watson."

This is an atom: 
"We can ask Mr Watson at once. I am afraid we must wait till Richard comes home, for I don't
know where a letter would catch him."

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw pulled the bell that rang into the head-clerk's room, saying as he did so,

This is an atom: 
"You may depend upon it, Farquhar, the blunder lies with Benson himself. He is just the man
to muddle away his money in indiscriminate charity, and then to wonder what has become of it."

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar was discreet enough to hold his tongue.

This is an atom: 
"Mr Watson," said Mr Bradshaw, as the old clerk made his appearance, "here is some mistake
about those Insurance shares we purchased for Benson ten or a dozen years ago. He spoke to
Mr Farquhar about some bonus they are paying to the shareholders, it seems; and, in reply to
Mr Farquhar's letter, the Insurance Company say the shares were sold twelve months since. Have
you any knowledge of the transaction? Has the transfer passed through your hands? By the way"
(turning to Mr Farquhar), "who kept the certificates? Did Benson or we?"

This is an atom: 
"I really don't know," said Mr Farquhar. "Perhaps Mr Watson can tell us."

This is an atom: 
Mr Watson meanwhile was studying the letter. When he had ended it, he took off his spectacles,
wiped them, and replacing them, he read it again.

This is an atom: 
"It seems very strange, sir," he said at length, with his trembling, aged voice, "for I paid
Mr Benson the account of the dividends myself last June, and got a receipt in form, and that
is since the date of the alleged transfer."

This is an atom: 
"Pretty nearly twelve months after it took place," said Mr Farquhar.

This is an atom: 
"How did you receive the dividends? An order on the Bank, along with old Mrs Cranmer's?" asked
Mr Bradshaw, sharply.

This is an atom: 
"I don't know how they came. Mr Richard gave me the money, and desired me to get the receipt."

This is an atom: 
"It's unlucky Richard is from home," said Mr Bradshaw. "He could have cleared up this mystery
for us."

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar was silent.

This is an atom: 
"Do you know where the certificates were kept, Mr Watson?" said he.

This is an atom: 
"I'll not be sure, but I think they were with Mrs Cranmer's papers and deeds in box A, 24."

This is an atom: 
"I wish old Cranmer would have made any other man his executor. She, too, is always coming
with some unreasonable request or other."

This is an atom: 
"Mr Benson's inquiry about his bonus is perfectly reasonable, at any rate."

This is an atom: 
Mr Watson, who was dwelling in the slow fashion of age on what had been said before, now spoke:

This is an atom: 
"I'll not be sure, but I am almost certain, Mr Benson said, when I paid him last June, that
he thought he ought to give the receipt on a stamp, and had spoken about it to Mr Richard the
time before, but that Mr Richard said it was of no consequence. Yes," continued he, gathering
up his memory as he went on, "he did--I remember now--and I thought to myself that Mr Richard
was but a young man. Mr Richard will know all about it."

This is an atom: 
"Yes," said Mr Farquhar, gravely.

This is an atom: 
"I shan't wait till Richard's return," said Mr Bradshaw. "We can soon see if the certificates
are in the box Watson points out; if they are there, the Insurance people are no more fit to
manage their concern than that cat, and I shall tell them so. If they are not there (as I suspect
will prove to be the case), it is just forgetfulness on Benson's part, as I have said from
the first."

This is an atom: 
"You forget the payment of the dividends," said Mr Farquhar, in a low voice.

This is an atom: 
"Well, sir! what then?" said Mr Bradshaw, abruptly. While he spoke--while his eye met Mr Farquhar's--the
hinted meaning of the latter flashed through his mind; but he was only made angry to find that
such a suspicion could pass through any one's imagination.

This is an atom: 
"I suppose I may go, sir," said Watson, respectfully, an uneasy consciousness of what was in
Mr Farquhar's thoughts troubling the faithful old clerk.

This is an atom: 
"Yes. Go. What do you mean about the dividends?" asked Mr Bradshaw, impetuously of Mr Farquhar.

This is an atom: 
"Simply, that I think there can have been no forgetfulness--no mistake on Mr Benson's part,"
said Mr Farquhar, unwilling to put his dim suspicion into words.

This is an atom: 
"Then of course it is some blunder of that confounded Insurance Company. I will write to them
to-day, and make them a little brisker and more correct in their statements."

This is an atom: 
"Don't you think it would be better to wait till Richard's return? He may be able to explain it."

This is an atom: 
"No, sir!" said Mr Bradshaw, sharply. "I do not think it would be better. It has not been my
way of doing business to spare any one, or any company, the consequences of their own carelessness;
nor to obtain information second-hand when I could have it direct from the source. I shall
write to the Insurance Office by the next post."

This is an atom: 
Mr Farquhar saw that any further remonstrance on his part would only aggravate his partner's
obstinacy; and, besides, it was but a suspicion--an uncomfortable suspicion. It was possible
that some of the clerks at the Insurance Office might have made a mistake. Watson was not sure,
after all, that the certificates had been deposited in box A, 24; and when he and Mr Farquhar
could not find them there, the old man drew more and yet more back from his first assertion
of belief that they had been placed there.

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw wrote an angry and indignant reproach of carelessness to the Insurance Company.
By the next mail one of their clerks came down to Eccleston; and having leisurely refreshed
himself at the inn, and ordered his dinner with care, he walked up to the great warehouse of
Bradshaw and Co., and sent in his card, with a pencil notification, "On the part of the Star
Insurance Company," to Mr Bradshaw himself.

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw held the card in his hand for a minute or two without raising his eyes. Then he
spoke out loud and firm:

This is an atom: 
"Desire the gentleman to walk up. Stay! I will ring my bell in a minute or two, and then show
him upstairs."

This is an atom: 
When the errand-boy had closed the door, Mr Bradshaw went to a cupboard where he usually kept
a glass and a bottle of wine (of which he very seldom partook, for he was an abstemious man).
He intended now to take a glass, but the bottle was empty; and though there was plenty more
to be had for ringing, or even simply going into another room, he would not allow himself to
do this. He stood and lectured himself in thought.

This is an atom: 
"After all, I am a fool for once in my life. If the certificates are in no box which I have
yet examined, that does not imply they may not be in some one which I have not had time to
search. Farquhar would stay so late last night! And even if they are in none of the boxes here,
that does not prove--" He gave the bell a jerking ring, and it was yet sounding when Mr Smith,
the insurance clerk, entered.

This is an atom: 
The manager of the Insurance Company had been considerably nettled at the tone of Mr Bradshaw's
letter; and had instructed the clerk to assume some dignity at first in vindicating (as it
was well in his power to do) the character of the proceedings of the Company, but at the same
time he was not to go too far, for the firm of Bradshaw and Co. was daily looming larger in
the commercial world, and if any reasonable explanation could be given it was to be received,
and bygones be bygones.

This is an atom: 
"Sit down, sir!" said Mr Bradshaw.

This is an atom: 
"You are aware, sir, I presume, that I come on the part of Mr Dennison, the manager of the
Star Insurance Company, to reply in person to a letter of yours, of the 29th, addressed to him?"

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw bowed. "A very careless piece of business," he said, stiffly.

This is an atom: 
"Mr Dennison does not think you will consider it as such when you have seen the deed of transfer,
which I am commissioned to show you."

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw took the deed with a steady hand. He wiped his spectacles quietly, without delay,
and without hurry, and adjusted them on his nose. It is possible that he was rather long in
looking over the document--at least, the clerk had just begun to wonder if he was reading through
the whole of it, instead of merely looking at the signature, when Mr Bradshaw said: "It is
possible that it may be--of course, you will allow me to take this paper to Mr Benson, to--to
inquire if this be his signature?"

This is an atom: 
"There can be no doubt of it, I think, sir," said the clerk, calmly smiling, for he knew Mr
Benson's signature well.

This is an atom: 
"I don't know, sir--I don't know." (He was speaking as if the pronunciation of every word required
a separate effort of will, like a man who has received a slight paralytic stroke.)

This is an atom: 
"You have heard, sir, of such a thing as forgery--forgery, sir?" said he, repeating the last
word very distinctly; for he feared that the first time he had said it, it was rather slurred over.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, sir! there is no room for imagining such a thing, I assure you. In our affairs we become
aware of curious forgetfulness on the part of those who are not of business habits."

This is an atom: 
"Still I should like to show it Mr Benson, to prove to him his forgetfulness, you know. I believe,
on my soul, it is some of his careless forgetfulness--I do, sir," said he. Now he spoke very
quickly. "It must have been. Allow me to convince myself. You shall have it back to-night,
or the first thing in the morning."

This is an atom: 
The clerk did not quite like to relinquish the deed, nor yet did he like to refuse Mr Bradshaw.
If that very uncomfortable idea of forgery should have any foundation in truth--and he had
given up the writing! There were a thousand chances to one against its being anything but a
stupid blunder; the risk was more imminent of offending one of the directors.

This is an atom: 
As he hesitated, Mr Bradshaw spoke, very calmly, and almost with a smile on his face. He had
regained his self-command. "You are afraid, I see. I assure you, you may trust me. If there
has been any fraud--if I have the slightest suspicion of the truth of the surmise I threw out
just now,"--he could not quite speak the bare naked word that was chilling his heart--"I will
not fail to aid the ends of justice, even though the culprit should be my own son."

This is an atom: 
He ended, as he began, with a smile--such a smile!--the stiff lips refused to relax and cover
the teeth. But all the time he kept saying to himself:

This is an atom: 
"I don't believe it--I don't believe it. I'm convinced it's a blunder of that old fool Benson."

This is an atom: 
But when he had dismissed the clerk, and secured the piece of paper, he went and locked the
door, and laid his head on his desk, and moaned aloud.

This is an atom: 
He had lingered in the office for the two previous nights; at first, occupying himself in searching
for the certificates of the Insurance shares; but, when all the boxes and other repositories
for papers had been ransacked, the thought took hold of him that they might be in Richard's
private desk; and, with the determination which overlooks the means to get at the end, he had
first tried all his own keys on the complicated lock, and then broken it open with two decided
blows of a poker, the instrument nearest at hand. He did not find the certificates. Richard
had always considered himself careful in destroying any dangerous or tell-tale papers; but
the stern father found enough, in what remained, to convince him that his pattern son--more
even than his pattern son, his beloved pride--was far other than what he seemed.

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw did not skip or miss a word. He did not shrink while he read. He folded up letter
by letter; he snuffed the candle just when its light began to wane, and no sooner; but he did
not miss or omit one paper--he read every word. Then, leaving the letters in a heap upon the
table, and the broken desk to tell its own tale, he locked the door of the room which was appropriated
to his son as junior partner, and carried the key away with him.

This is an atom: 
There was a faint hope, even after this discovery of many circumstances of Richard's life which
shocked and dismayed his father--there was still a faint hope that he might not be guilty of
forgery--that it might be no forgery after all--only a blunder--an omission--a stupendous piece
of forgetfulness. That hope was the one straw that Mr Bradshaw clung to.

This is an atom: 
Late that night Mr Benson sat in his study. Every one else in the house had gone to bed; but
he was expecting a summons to someone who was dangerously ill. He was not startled, therefore,
at the knock which came to the front door about twelve; but he was rather surprised at the
character of the knock, so slow and loud, with a pause between each rap. His study-door was
but a step from that which led into the street. He opened it, and there stood--Mr Bradshaw;
his large, portly figure not to be mistaken even in the dusky night.

This is an atom: 
He said, "That is right. It was you I wanted to see." And he walked straight into the study.
Mr Benson followed, and shut the door. Mr Bradshaw was standing by the table, fumbling in his
pocket. He pulled out the deed; and opening it, after a pause, in which you might have counted
five, he held it out to Mr Benson.

This is an atom: 
"Read it!" said he. He spoke not another word until time had been allowed for its perusal.
Then he added:

This is an atom: 
"That is your signature?" The words were an assertion, but the tone was that of question.

This is an atom: 
"No, it is not," said Mr Benson, decidedly. "It is very like my writing. I could almost say
it was mine, but I know it is not."

This is an atom: 
"Recollect yourself a little. The date is August the third of last year, fourteen months ago.
You may have forgotten it." The tone of the voice had a kind of eager entreaty in it, which
Mr Benson did not notice,--he was so startled at the fetch of his own writing.

This is an atom: 
"It is most singularly like mine; but I could not have signed away these shares--all the property
I have--without the slightest remembrance of it."

This is an atom: 
"Stranger things have happened. For the love of Heaven, think if you did not sign it. It's
a deed of transfer for those Insurance shares, you see. You don't remember it? You did not
write this name--these words?" He looked at Mr Benson with craving wistfulness for one particular
answer. Mr Benson was struck at last by the whole proceeding, and glanced anxiously at Mr Bradshaw,
whose manner, gait, and voice were so different from usual that he might well excite attention.
But as soon as the latter was aware of this momentary inspection, he changed his tone all at once.

This is an atom: 
"Don't imagine, sir, I wish to force any invention upon you as a remembrance. If you did not
write this name, I know who did. Once more I ask you,--does no glimmering recollection of--having
needed money, we'll say--I never wanted you to refuse my subscription to the chapel, God knows!--of
having sold these accursed shares?--Oh! I see by your face you did not write it; you need not
speak to me--I know."

This is an atom: 
He sank down into a chair near him. His whole figure drooped. In a moment he was up, and standing
straight as an arrow, confronting Mr Benson, who could find no clue to this stern man's agitation.

This is an atom: 
"You say you did not write these words?" pointing to the signature, with an untrembling finger.
"I believe you; Richard Bradshaw did write them."

This is an atom: 
"My dear sir--my dear old friend!" exclaimed Mr Benson, "you are rushing to a conclusion for
which, I am convinced, there is no foundation; there is no reason to suppose that because--"

This is an atom: 
"There is reason, sir. Do not distress yourself--I am perfectly calm." His stony eyes and immovable
face did indeed look rigid. "What we have now to do is to punish the offence. I have not one
standard for myself and those I love--(and, Mr Benson, I did love him)--and another for the
rest of the world. If a stranger had forged my name, I should have known it was my duty to
prosecute him. You must prosecute Richard."

This is an atom: 
"I will not," said Mr Benson.

This is an atom: 
"You think, perhaps, that I shall feel it acutely. You are mistaken. He is no longer as my
son to me. I have always resolved to disown any child of mine who was guilty of sin. I disown
Richard. He is as a stranger to me. I shall feel no more at his exposure--his punishment--"
He could not go on, for his voice was choking. "Of course, you understand that I must feel
shame at our connexion; it is that that is troubling me; that is but consistent with a man
who has always prided himself on the integrity of his name; but as for that boy, who has been
brought up all his life as I have brought up my children, it must be some innate wickedness!
Sir, I can cut him off, though he has been as my right hand--beloved. Let me be no hindrance
to the course of justice, I beg. He has forged your name--he has defrauded you of money--of
your all, I think you said."

This is an atom: 
"Someone has forged my name. I am not convinced that it was your son. Until I know all the
circumstances, I decline to prosecute."

This is an atom: 
"What circumstances?" asked Mr Bradshaw, in an authoritative manner, which would have shown
irritation but for his self-command.

This is an atom: 
"The force of the temptation--the previous habits of the person--"

This is an atom: 
"Of Richard. He is the person," Mr Bradshaw put in.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson went on, without taking any notice. "I should think it right to prosecute, if I found
out that this offence against me was only one of a series committed, with premeditation, against
society. I should then feel, as a protector of others more helpless than myself--"

This is an atom: 
"It was your all," said Mr Bradshaw.

This is an atom: 
"It was all my money; it was not my all," replied Mr Benson; and then he went on as if the
interruption had never been: "Against an habitual offender. I shall not prosecute Richard.
Not because he is your son--do not imagine that! I should decline taking such a step against
any young man without first ascertaining the particulars about him, which I know already about
Richard, and which determine me against doing what would blast his character for life--would
destroy every good quality he has."

This is an atom: 
"What good quality remains to him?" asked Mr Bradshaw. "He has deceived me--he has offended God."

This is an atom: 
"Have we not all offended Him?" Mr Benson said, in a low tone.

This is an atom: 
"Not consciously. I never do wrong consciously. But Richard--Richard." The remembrance of the
undeceiving letters--the forgery--filled up his heart so completely that he could not speak
for a minute or two. Yet when he saw Mr Benson on the point of saying something, he broke in:

This is an atom: 
"It is no use talking, sir. You and I cannot agree on these subjects. Once more, I desire you
to prosecute that boy, who is no longer a child of mine."

This is an atom: 
"Mr Bradshaw, I shall not prosecute him. I have said it once for all. To-morrow you will be
glad that I do not listen to you. I should only do harm by saying more at present."

This is an atom: 
There is always something aggravating in being told, that the mood in which we are now viewing
things strongly will not be our mood at some other time. It implies that our present feelings
are blinding us, and that some more clear-sighted spectator is able to distinguish our future
better than we do ourselves. The most shallow person dislikes to be told that any one can gauge
his depth. Mr Bradshaw was not soothed by this last remark of Mr Benson's. He stooped down
to take up his hat and be gone. Mr Benson saw his dizzy way of groping, and gave him what he
sought for; but he received no word of thanks. Mr Bradshaw went silently towards the door,
but, just as he got there, he turned round, and said:

This is an atom: 
"If there were more people like me, and fewer like you, there would be less evil in the world,
sir. It's your sentimentalists that nurse up sin."

This is an atom: 
Although Mr Benson had been very calm during this interview, he had been much shocked by what
had been let out respecting Richard's forgery; not by the fact itself so much as by what it
was a sign of. Still, he had known the young man from childhood, and had seen, and often regretted,
that his want of moral courage had rendered him peculiarly liable to all the bad effects arising
from his father's severe and arbitrary mode of treatment. Dick would never have had "pluck"
enough to be a hardened villain, under any circumstances; but, unless some good influence,
some strength, was brought to bear upon him, he might easily sink into the sneaking scoundrel.
Mr Benson determined to go to Mr Farquhar's the first thing in the morning, and consult him
as a calm, clear-headed family friend--partner in the business, as well as son and brother-in-law
to the people concerned.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXI

This is an atom: 
An Accident to the Dover Coach

This is an atom: 
While Mr Benson lay awake for fear of oversleeping himself, and so being late at Mr Farquhar's
(it was somewhere about six o'clock--dark as an October morning is at that time), Sally came
to his door and knocked. She was always an early riser; and if she had not been gone to bed
long before Mr Bradshaw's visit last night, Mr Benson might safely have trusted to her calling him.

This is an atom: 
"Here's a woman down below as must see you directly. She'll be upstairs after me if you're
not down quick."

This is an atom: 
"Is it any one from Clarke's?"

This is an atom: 
"No, no! not it, master," said she, through the keyhole; "I reckon it's Mrs Bradshaw, for all
she's muffled up."

This is an atom: 
He needed no other word. When he went down, Mrs Bradshaw sat in his easy-chair, swaying her
body to and fro, and crying without restraint. Mr Benson came up to her, before she was aware
that he was there.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! sir," said she, getting up and taking hold of both his hands, "you won't be so cruel,
will you? I have got some money somewhere--some money my father settled on me, sir; I don't
know how much, but I think it's more than two thousand pounds, and you shall have it all. If
I can't give it you now, I'll make a will, sir. Only be merciful to poor Dick--don't go and
prosecute him, sir."

This is an atom: 
"My dear Mrs Bradshaw, don't agitate yourself in this way. I never meant to prosecute him."

This is an atom: 
"But Mr Bradshaw says that you must."

This is an atom: 
"I shall not, indeed. I have told Mr Bradshaw so."

This is an atom: 
"Has he been here? Oh! is not he cruel? I don't care. I've been a good wife till now. I know
I have. I have done all he bid me, ever since we were married. But now I will speak my mind,
and say to everybody how cruel he is--how hard to his own flesh and blood! If he puts poor
Dick in prison, I will go too. If I'm to choose between my husband and my son, I choose my
son; for he will have no friends, unless I am with him."

This is an atom: 
"Mr Bradshaw will think better of it. You will see that, when his first anger and disappointment
are over, he will not be hard or cruel."

This is an atom: 
"You don't know Mr Bradshaw," said she, mournfully, "if you think he'll change. I might beg
and beg--I have done many a time, when we had little children, and I wanted to save them a
whipping--but no begging ever did any good. At last I left it off. He'll not change."

This is an atom: 
"Perhaps not for human entreaty. Mrs Bradshaw, is there nothing more powerful?"

This is an atom: 
The tone of his voice suggested what he did not say.

This is an atom: 
"If you mean that God may soften his heart," replied she, humbly, "I'm not going to deny God's
power--I have need to think of Him," she continued, bursting into fresh tears, "for I am a
very miserable woman. Only think! he cast it up against me last night, and said, if I had not
spoilt Dick this never would have happened."

This is an atom: 
"He hardly knew what he was saying last night. I will go to Mr Farquhar's directly, and see
him; and you had better go home, my dear Mrs Bradshaw; you may rely upon our doing all that
we can."

This is an atom: 
With some difficulty he persuaded her not to accompany him to Mr Farquhar's; but he had, indeed,
to take her to her own door before he could convince her that, at present, she could do nothing
but wait the result of the consultation of others.

This is an atom: 
It was before breakfast, and Mr Farquhar was alone; so Mr Benson had a quiet opportunity of
telling the whole story to the husband before the wife came down. Mr Farquhar was not much
surprised, though greatly distressed. The general opinion he had always entertained of Richard's
character had predisposed him to fear, even before the inquiry respecting the Insurance shares.
But it was still a shock when it came, however much it might have been anticipated.

This is an atom: 
"What can we do?" said Mr Benson, as Mr Farquhar sat gloomily silent.

This is an atom: 
"That is just what I was asking myself. I think I must see Mr Bradshaw, and try and bring him
a little out of this unmerciful frame of mind. That must be the first thing. Will you object
to accompany me at once? It seems of particular consequence that we should subdue his obduracy
before the affair gets wind."

This is an atom: 
"I will go with you willingly. But I believe I rather serve to irritate Mr Bradshaw; he is
reminded of things he has said to me formerly, and which he thinks he is bound to act up to.
However, I can walk with you to the door, and wait for you (if you'll allow me) in the street.
I want to know how he is to-day, both bodily and mentally; for indeed, Mr Farquhar, I should
not have been surprised last night if he had dropped down dead, so terrible was his strain
upon himself."

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson was left at the door as he had desired, while Mr Farquhar went in.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Mr Farquhar, what is the matter?" exclaimed the girls, running to him. "Mamma sits crying
in the old nursery. We believe she has been there all night. She will not tell us what it is,
nor let us be with her; and papa is locked up in his room, and won't even answer us when we
speak, though we know he is up and awake, for we heard him tramping about all night."

This is an atom: 
"Let me go up to him," said Mr Farquhar.

This is an atom: 
"He won't let you in. It will be of no use." But in spite of what they said, he went up; and
to their surprise, after hearing who it was, their father opened the door, and admitted their
brother-in-law. He remained with Mr Bradshaw about half an hour, and then came into the dining-room,
where the two girls stood huddled over the fire, regardless of the untasted breakfast behind
them; and, writing a few lines, he desired them to take his note up to their mother, saying
it would comfort her a little, and that he should send Jemima, in two or three hours, with
the baby--perhaps to remain some days with them. He had no time to tell them more; Jemima would.

This is an atom: 
He left them, and rejoined Mr Benson. "Come home and breakfast with me. I am off to London
in an hour or two, and must speak with you first."

This is an atom: 
On reaching his house, he ran upstairs to ask Jemima to breakfast alone in her dressing-room,
and returned in five minutes or less.

This is an atom: 
"Now I can tell you about it," said he. "I see my way clearly to a certain point. We must prevent
Dick and his father meeting just now, or all hope of Dick's reformation is gone for ever. His
father is as hard as the nether mill-stone. He has forbidden me his house."

This is an atom: 
"Forbidden you!"

This is an atom: 
"Yes; because I would not give up Dick as utterly lost and bad; and because I said I should
return to London with the clerk, and fairly tell Dennison (he's a Scotchman, and a man of sense
and feeling) the real state of the case. By the way, we must not say a word to the clerk; otherwise
he will expect an answer, and make out all sorts of inferences for himself, from the unsatisfactory
reply he must have. Dennison will be upon honour--will see every side of the case--will know
you refuse to prosecute; the Company of which he is manager are no losers. Well! when I said
what I thought wise, of all this--when I spoke as if my course were a settled and decided thing,
the grim old man asked me if he was to be an automaton in his own house. He assured me he had
no feeling for Dick--all the time he was shaking like an aspen; in short, repeated much the
same things he must have said to you last night. However, I defied him; and the consequence
is, I'm forbidden the house, and, what is more, he says he will not come to the office while
I remain a partner."

This is an atom: 
"What shall you do?"

This is an atom: 
"Send Jemima and the baby. There's nothing like a young child for bringing people round to
a healthy state of feeling; and you don't know what Jemima is, Mr Benson! No! though you've
known her from her birth. If she can't comfort her mother, and if the baby can't steal into
her grandfather's heart, why--I don't know what you may do to me. I shall tell Jemima all,
and trust to her wit and wisdom to work at this end, while I do my best at the other."

This is an atom: 
"Richard is abroad, is not he?"

This is an atom: 
"He will be in England to-morrow. I must catch him somewhere; but that I can easily do. The
difficult point will be, what to do with him--what to say to him, when I find him. He must
give up his partnership, that's clear. I did not tell his father so, but I am resolved upon
it. There shall be no tampering with the honour of the firm to which I belong."

This is an atom: 
"But what will become of him?" asked Mr Benson, anxiously.

This is an atom: 
"I do not yet know. But, for Jemima's sake--for his dear old father's sake--I will not leave
him adrift. I will find him some occupation as clear from temptation as I can. I will do all
in my power. And he will do much better, if he has any good in him, as a freer agent, not cowed
by his father into a want of individuality and self-respect. I believe I must dismiss you,
Mr Benson," said he, looking at his watch; "I have to explain all to my wife, and to go to
that clerk. You shall hear from me in a day or two."

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson half envied the younger man's elasticity of mind, and power of acting promptly. He
himself felt as if he wanted to sit down in his quiet study, and think over the revelations
and events of the last twenty-four hours. Finding the Sultana in such a fair way of recovery, the
Emperor dismissed his Governors to their respective provinces, and removed his court to Mequinez,
his favourite summer residence, leaving me here, to complete the cure of the Sultana, and to
attend several of his subjects, who stand high in his favour, in the lower town of Fez. As the
attendance required by my patients does not occupy the whole of my time, I employ my leisure
in observing such things as appear most worthy of remark.

This is an atom: 
The town (or rather _towns_ of Fez, this city being divided into
two distinct parts, the one called Upper, the other Lower Fez) is
the capital of the kingdom of that name, and is supposed to contain
about three hundred thousand inhabitants, besides foreigners of
their own persuasion.

This is an atom: 
There are upwards of five hundred mosques: one of them in particular, which was built by Edris
the Second, and in which his remains were deposited, is magnificent beyond description, and
is about a mile and a half in circumference. There is another very little inferior to this,
which was erected by the Arabs of Caiwan, and called _Carubin_. The other mosques have been
constructed since. To most of the mosques are annexed several colleges, religious schools, and
hospitals for the pilgrims who visit this place, for, in point of
holiness, it is considered as next to Mecca and Medina.

This is an atom: 
The lower town of Fez was built by Edris the Second, about the end
of the eighth century, and is taken notice of by Pliny under the
name of _Volubilis_.

This is an atom: 
According to that author, and others, this city ranked amongst the principal inland towns
of Mauritania, and was a Roman colony.
It is a place of considerable trade; the inhabitants are mostly freed men, engaged in commerce,
and reputed to be very opulent and industrious; they have purchased a charter, by which they
ensure a kind of independence, and are totally unmolested in their traffic; in short, there
are great privileges attached to this town, which are not to be met with in any other part
of Barbary. The lower town is almost entirely surrounded by hills, which are highly cultivated,
and abound with vineyards, and gardens producing most exquisite fruits.

This is an atom: 
Upper Fez is situated on one of the highest of the hills which
almost encircle the lower town, and contains the imperial palace
and seraglio, several old palaces occupied by the sons of the
Emperor, and the habitations of the principal officers in the
household.

This is an atom: 
Contiguous to these, is the inclosed town belonging solely to the
Jews, who are about thirty thousand in number, having one hundred
and fifty synagogues.

This is an atom: 
On that part of the wall of the Jewish town which overlooks Lower Fez, are placed several heavy
pieces of ordnance, which, in case of an insurrection in the latter, would very soon demolish it:
as the lower town is by much the most populous and extensive, this precaution may not be
unnecessary. The Jewish town is commanded by an Alcaid, who cannot
however shield its unfortunate inhabitants from oppression and
insults.

This is an atom: 
These people are obliged to walk barefooted through the Moorish streets; and they suffer the
greatest outrages without a murmur, nay, some of them have been
actually murdered in the act of selling their goods to the Moors.

This is an atom: 
No Christian is allowed to appear publicly in the streets of Fez, without a special permission
from the Emperor, and a military escort.

This is an atom: 
These towns are supplied with water in a most singular manner from
a river, called _Rasalema_, which takes its source in a valley near
the road to Mequinez.

This is an atom: 
It issues from a rock, about eight or ten feet above the ground,
in a stream, that, from the form of the valley through which it
runs, appears a continued waterfall.

This is an atom: 
It is conveyed into the Emperor's garden by means of a large wheel, about twenty-five feet
in diameter, round which, at regular distances, are small buckets, which, as the wheel goes
round, are alternately filled, and emptied into a reservoir at the
top of the wall of the garden.

This is an atom: 
From the reservoir the water is also conveyed to the upper and lower towns by aqueducts.

This is an atom: 
On the outside of one of the western gates of Upper Fez are the gardens of the Emperor,
surrounded by a good stone wall, within which are a number of
spacious walks, shaded by rows of tall trees, on each side, and
intersected by parterres and grass-plots, on which are elegant
pavilions, some in a pyramidical, others in a conical form, where
the Emperor frequently retires, to take his repose, or to amuse
himself with his courtiers.

This is an atom: 
These pavilions are between thirty and forty feet in height, covered on the outside with varnished
tiles of different colours, and contain three and sometimes four neat apartments, furnished
in the most simple style imaginable, having in general nothing more than a carpet, several couches,
a few arm-chairs, a table, a clock, and a tea-equipage of china.

This is an atom: 
The cornices round the walls of these apartments are embellished with passages from the Koran,
and other Arabic sentences, carved in cedar-wood.

This is an atom: 
The propensity to cheating, so prevalent in all Barbary, is no where
so notorious as in the lower town of Fez; and the Europeans who
trade with the Moorish merchants here must employ the same means
as themselves, or submit to be most flagitiously imposed upon.

This is an atom: 
I have visited several manufactories of carpets, mats, silk, linen, and leather, of which the
merchants export great quantities. I have also seen some beautifully embroidered shawls,
scarfs, and sword-knots, of the manufacture of this country. Their exports besides are,
elephants' teeth, ostrich feathers, copper, tin, wool, hides,
honey, wax, dates, raisins, olives, almonds, gum-arabic, and sandrach.

This is an atom: 
They carry on a considerable trade, by caravans, to Mecca and Medina, the inland regions of
Africa, and to the farthermost parts of the coast of Guinea; from
which last place they bring gold-dust, and a prodigious number of
negroes, some of whom are destined to serve in the Emperor's armies;
the rest are slaves in the Moorish houses and fields.

This is an atom: 
The dress of the Moors is composed of a linen shirt, over which
they fasten a cloth or silk vestment with a sash, loose trowsers
reaching to the knee, a white serge cloak, or capote, and yellow
slippers: their arms and legs are quite bare.

This is an atom: 
The principal people are distinguished by the fineness of their turbans, their linen shirts,
and cloth or silk garments, which are richly embroidered with gold; when they go abroad,
they cover this dress with an alhaik, differing in quality according to the circumstances of
the wearer; and which they fold round them like a large blanket. They never move their turbans,
but pull off their slippers, when they attend religious duties,
or their Sovereign, or visit their relatives, friends, priests, or
civil and military officers.

This is an atom: 
The Moorish gentry are clean in their persons, in their manners tolerably genteel and complaisant,
far from being loquacious, though not prone to reflection. They possess an unbounded degree
of duplicity and flattery; are perfectly strangers to the notions of truth and honour, promising a thing
one day which they utterly deny the next.

This is an atom: 
They are less irascible than many other nations; but when grossly injured, seek revenge in assassination.
They are more vindictive than brave, more superstitious than devout, firmly attached to their
ancient customs, and wholly averse to every kind of innovation.

This is an atom: 
The Moors, in general, are extremely fond of fruit and vegetables, which contribute very much
to their contentment. The peasants eat meat only on certain great days. They are excessively
dirty in their cooking, and the style of their dishes is not at all adapted to the taste of
an Englishman. Their soups are made most intolerably hot with spices; and their favourite
dish is _cous-ca-sou_, which appears to me to be prepared in the
following manner: The meat and vegetables are laid alternately in
a large bowl, and seasoned; then the whole is covered with fine
wheaten flour, made into small grains, very like the Italian pastes.

This is an atom: 
It is raised into the form of a pyramid, and I should imagine stewed, or rather steamed, as
the outside remains perfectly white, which it would not were it baked. The whole of the inside,
when brought to table, is mingled almost into one mass; the meat separating from the bones,
without the smallest difficulty: it does not contain any gravy, and the Moors eat it by
handsfull.

This is an atom: 
I generally live upon mutton and veal, both of which are very good: the bread and butter are
excellent, but the latter will not keep more than twenty-four hours without becoming rancid.

This is an atom: 
My greatest annoyance here is the infinite number of bugs and fleas, which infest me by day and
night most intolerably.

This is an atom: 
LETTER XIV.

This is an atom: 
_Fez--Debility of the Moors--Mosques--Antiquities, Roman, Carthaginian, and Saracen--Storks
held in great Veneration--Baths-- Bazars--Inhabitants--Residence--Menagerie--Marvellous
Preservation of a Jew--Lions--Tigers--Leopards--Hyenas._
_Fez_, ----.

This is an atom: 
Considering the mildness of the climate, the uncommon fertility of
the soil, the number of mineral waters, the fragrancy and salubrity
of the air, one would imagine that the frame and constitution of a
Moor cannot but be beautiful, strong, and healthy; yet, though the
most handsome people of both sexes are to be met with in this great
city, the number of miserable objects, the wretched victims of
excessive early passions, is in a much larger proportion: it is
shocking beyond description to meet them in every corner of the
streets.

This is an atom: 
I have visited a great many of these poor creatures, and found them in such a state, that
decency obliges me to draw a veil over it.

This is an atom: 
The mosques of this town, which I have before mentioned as very numerous, are square buildings,
and generally of stone; before the principal gate there is a court paved with white marble,
with piazzas round, the roofs of which are supported by marble columns. In niches within these
piazzas, the Moors perform their ablutions before they enter the mosques. Attached to each
mosque is a tower, with three small open galleries, one above
another, whence the people are called to prayer, not by a bell, but
by an officer appointed for that duty.

This is an atom: 
These towers, as well as the mosques, are covered with lead, and
adorned with gilding, and tiles of variegated colours.

This is an atom: 
No woman is allowed to enter the Moorish places of worship.

This is an atom: 
Several of the aqueducts, which were constructed by the Carthaginians and Romans, are still to
be seen; and the ruins of amphitheatres, and other public buildings, are found in the town and
neighbourhood of Fez: likewise many Saracen monuments of the most stupendous magnificence, which
were erected under the Caliphs of Bagdad. The mosques and ruins are frequented by a great
number of storks, which are very tame, and are regarded by the Moors as a kind of inferior
saints.

This is an atom: 
The baths here are wonderfully well constructed for the purpose. Some of them are square buildings,
but the greater part are circular, paved with black or white polished marble, and containing
three rooms: the first for undressing and dressing, the second for the water, and in the third
is the bath. Their manner of bathing is very curious: the attendant rubs the person with
great force, then pulls and stretches the limbs, as if he meant to dislocate every joint.
This exercise to these indolent people is very conducive to health.

This is an atom: 
The bazars in which the tradesmen have their shops, are very extensive. These shops are filled
with all kinds of merchandise. In the centre of the town is a rectangular building, with
colonnades, where the principal merchants attend daily to transact business.

This is an atom: 
The inhabitants of Fez are of a large muscular stature, fair complexion, with black beards
and eyes; extremely amorous and jealous of their women, whom they keep strictly guarded.
Their houses consist of four wings, forming a court in the centre, round which is an arcade, or piazza,
with one spacious apartment on each side. The court is paved with square pieces of marble,
and has a basin of the same in the centre, with a fountain. They keep their houses remarkably
clean and neat; but all the streets of this immense town are narrow, very badly paved with large
irregular stones, and most shockingly dirty. The tops of their houses, like those of Tetuan,
and other towns in Barbary, are flat, for the purpose of recreation.

This is an atom: 
Among the remnants of several amphitheatres, there is one very nearly entire, which is kept
in constant repair at the expense of the Emperor, and appropriated as a menagerie for lions,
tigers, and leopards. As I was contemplating it the other day, I felt at a loss to account
for this being kept in repair, while the others were suffered to moulder into dust, unheeded,
excepting a very few, and those but partially prevented from sharing
the general wreck.

This is an atom: 
I had stood some time, thus employed, when I was suddenly interrupted in my meditations, by the
sound of voices close behind me; on turning I perceived two Jews, one of whom I knew very
well, from having given advice to some part of his family. I immediately inquired how it
happened that the building before us was so carefully preserved
from going to ruin, as happened to most of the others.

This is an atom: 
He informed me, that it was a kind of menagerie for wild beasts. "It was the same in the time of the
late Emperor," continued he; "and a very curious incident befell
one of my brethren in that place."

This is an atom: 
As the narrative was not merely very curious, but really wonderful, I cannot forbear sending
you the substance of it; as to give it you in the very circuitous way it came to me, would
be rather a tax upon your patience, particularly, as you may not be so destitute of resources
of amusement, as, I confess, I was at that moment.

This is an atom: 
It appears, that Muley Yezid, the late Emperor, had a great and invincible antipathy to the Jews
(indeed it was but too evident in the horrible transaction I mentioned in a former letter).

This is an atom: 
An unfortunate Israelite, having incurred the displeasure of that prince, was condemned to be
devoured by a ferocious lion, which had been purposely left without food for twenty-four
hours: when the animal was raging with hunger, the poor Jew had a rope fastened round his
waist, and in the presence of a great concourse of people was let down into the den; his
supplications for mercy, and screams of terror, availing him nothing. The man gave himself
up for lost, expecting every moment to be torn in pieces by the almost famished beast, who
was roaring most hideously; he threw himself on the ground in an agony of mind, much better
conceived than described. While in this attitude, the animal approached him, ceased roaring,
smelt him two or three times, then walked majestically round him, and gave him now and then
a gentle whisk with his tail, which seemed to signify that he might
rise, as he would not hurt him; finding the man still continue
motionless with fear, he retreated a few paces, and laid himself
down like a dog.

This is an atom: 
After a short time had elapsed, the Jew, recovering from his insensibility, and perceiving
himself unmolested, ventured to raise himself up, and observing the noble animal couched, and
no symptom of rage or anger in his countenance, he felt animated
with confidence.

This is an atom: 
In short, they became quite friendly, the lion suffering himself to be caressed by the Jew with
the utmost tameness.

This is an atom: 
It ended with the man being drawn up again unhurt, to the great astonishment of the spectators.
A heifer was afterwards let down, and instantly devoured. You may be sure this story was
too great a triumph on the part of the Israelites, to pass without a number of annotations
and reflections from the narrator, all tending to prove the victory
of their nation over the heathens.

This is an atom: 
For my part, I could not help thinking that there was too much of the miraculous in it.
However, I have often heard it asserted that the lion will never touch a man who is either
dead, or counterfeits death; indeed here they tell me, that, unless pressed by hunger or rage,
it never molests a man; and they assure me even that upon no account will these animals injure
a woman, but, on the contrary, will protect her, when they meet her at a watering-place.
This country abounds with lions, tigers, leopards, and hyenas, which
sometimes make nocturnal visits to the villages, and spread desolation
among the sheep and cattle.

This is an atom: 
No doubt, my dear D----, you will be very much surprised to observe my letter dated from this place. I
assure you I had not the most distant idea, when I wrote last, of removing so suddenly from
Fez. On the evening of the same day that I dispatched my letter to you, as I was preparing for
rest, an express arrived from the Emperor, begging me to repair hither without delay.
Concluding that nothing less than life or death depended on my
speedy arrival, I accordingly renounced the pleasures of the drowsy
god for a very uneasy seat on the back of a mule, and at midnight
set off for this place, leaving my baggage and attendants to follow
in the morning.

This is an atom: 
I rode very fast all night, and arrived here about nine o'clock the next day. When I dismounted,
I was so extremely stiff, that it was with the utmost difficulty I could stand; I was most
dreadfully fatigued, and stood in very great need of repose; but waving all selfish considerations,
I thought only of being serviceable, and therefore lost no time
in waiting on the Emperor.

This is an atom: 
He received me in the kindest and most flattering manner, and expressed great pleasure at
seeing me; but I found my patient's case not so very urgent as I had imagined; a few hours
delay would not have endangered the life of any human being, and
it would have saved _one_, some aching bones.

This is an atom: 
The occasional
copying, or patient writing to dictation, that gave rest to Mr Benson's weary spine, was done
by her with sunny alacrity. But, most of all, Leonard's heart rejoiced when his mother came
home. Then came the quiet confidences, the tender exchange of love, the happy walks from which
he returned stronger and stronger--going from strength to strength as his mother led the way.
It was well, as they saw now, that the great shock of the disclosure had taken place when it
did. She, for her part, wondered at her own cowardliness in having even striven to keep back
the truth from her child--the truth that was so certain to be made clear, sooner or later,
and which it was only owing to God's mercy that she was alive to encounter with him, and, by
so encountering, shield and give him good courage. Moreover, in her secret heart, she was thankful
that all occurred while he was yet too young to have much curiosity as to his father. If an
unsatisfied feeling of this kind occasionally stole into his mind, at any rate she never heard
any expression of it; for the past was a sealed book between them. And so, in the bright strength
of good endeavour, the days went on, and grew again to months and years.

This is an atom: 
Perhaps one little circumstance which occurred during this time had scarcely external importance
enough to be called an event; but in Mr Benson's mind it took rank as such. One day, about
a year after Richard Bradshaw had ceased to be a partner in his father's house, Mr Benson encountered
Mr Farquhar in the street, and heard from him of the creditable and respectable manner in which
Richard was conducting himself in Glasgow, where Mr Farquhar had lately been on business.

This is an atom: 
"I am determined to tell his father of this," said he; "I think his family are far too obedient
to his tacit prohibition of all mention of Richard's name."

This is an atom: 
"Tacit prohibition?" inquired Mr Benson.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! I dare say I use the words in a wrong sense for the correctness of a scholar; but what
I mean is, that he made a point of immediately leaving the room if Richard's name was mentioned;
and did it in so marked a manner, that by degrees they understood that it was their father's
desire that he should never be alluded to; which was all very well as long as there was nothing
pleasant to be said about him; but to-night I am going there, and shall take good care he does
not escape me before I have told him all I have heard and observed about Richard. He will never
be a hero of virtue, for his education has drained him of all moral courage; but with care,
and the absence of all strong temptation for a time, he will do very well; nothing to gratify
paternal pride, but certainly nothing to be ashamed of."

This is an atom: 
It was on the Sunday after this that the little circumstance to which I have alluded took place.

This is an atom: 
During the afternoon service, Mr Benson became aware that the large Bradshaw pew was no longer
unoccupied. In a dark corner Mr Bradshaw's white head was to be seen, bowed down low in prayer.
When last he had worshipped there, the hair on that head was iron-grey, and even in prayer
he had stood erect, with an air of conscious righteousness sufficient for all his wants, and
even some to spare with which to judge others. Now, that white and hoary head was never uplifted;
part of his unobtrusiveness might, it is true, be attributed to the uncomfortable feeling which
was sure to attend any open withdrawal of the declaration he had once made, never to enter
the chapel in which Mr Benson was minister again; and as such a feeling was natural to all
men, and especially to such a one as Mr Bradshaw, Mr Benson instinctively respected it, and
passed out of the chapel with his household, without ever directing his regards to the obscure
place where Mr Bradshaw still remained immovable.

This is an atom: 
From this day Mr Benson felt sure that the old friendly feeling existed once more between them,
although some time might elapse before any circumstance gave the signal for a renewal of their
intercourse.

CHAPTER XXXIII

This is an atom: 
A Mother to Be Proud Of

This is an atom: 
Old people tell of certain years when typhus fever swept over the country like a pestilence;
years that bring back the remembrance of deep sorrow--refusing to be comforted--to many a household;
and which those whose beloved passed through the fiery time unscathed, shrink from recalling:
for great and tremulous was the anxiety--miserable the constant watching for evil symptoms;
and beyond the threshold of home a dense cloud of depression hung over society at large. It
seemed as if the alarm was proportionate to the previous light-heartedness of fancied security--and
indeed it was so; for, since the days of King Belshazzar, the solemn decrees of Doom have ever
seemed most terrible when they awe into silence the merry revellers of life. So it was this
year to which I come in the progress of my story.

This is an atom: 
The summer had been unusually gorgeous. Some had complained of the steaming heat, but others
had pointed to the lush vegetation, which was profuse and luxuriant. The early autumn was wet
and cold, but people did not regard it, in contemplation of some proud rejoicing of the nation,
which filled every newspaper and gave food to every tongue. In Eccleston these rejoicings were
greater than in most places; for, by the national triumph of arms, it was supposed that a new
market for the staple manufacture of the place would be opened; and so the trade, which had
for a year or two been languishing, would now revive with redoubled vigour. Besides these legitimate
causes of good spirits, there was the rank excitement of a coming election, in consequence
of Mr Donne having accepted a Government office, procured for him by one of his influential
relations. This time, the Cranworths roused themselves from their magnificent torpor of security
in good season, and were going through a series of pompous and ponderous hospitalities, in
order to bring back the Eccleston voters to their allegiance.

This is an atom: 
While the town was full of these subjects by turns--now thinking and speaking of the great
revival of trade--now of the chances of the election, as yet some weeks distant--now of the
balls at Cranworth Court, in which Mr Cranworth had danced with all the belles of the shopocracy
of Eccleston--there came creeping, creeping, in hidden, slimy courses, the terrible fever--that
fever which is never utterly banished from the sad haunts of vice and misery, but lives in
such darkness, like a wild beast in the recesses of his den. It had begun in the low Irish
lodging-houses; but there it was so common it excited little attention. The poor creatures
died almost without the attendance of the unwarned medical men, who received their first notice
of the spreading plague from the Roman Catholic priests.

This is an atom: 
Before the medical men of Eccleston had had time to meet together and consult, and compare
the knowledge of the fever which they had severally gained, it had, like the blaze of a fire
which had long smouldered, burst forth in many places at once--not merely among the loose-living
and vicious, but among the decently poor--nay, even among the well-to-do and respectable. And
to add to the horror, like all similar pestilences, its course was most rapid at first, and
was fatal in the great majority of cases--hopeless from the beginning. There was a cry, and
then a deep silence, and then rose the long wail of the survivors.

This is an atom: 
A portion of the Infirmary of the town was added to that already set apart for a fever-ward;
the smitten were carried thither at once, whenever it was possible, in order to prevent the
spread of infection; and on that lazar-house was concentrated all the medical skill and force
of the place.

This is an atom: 
But when one of the physicians had died, in consequence of his attendance--when the customary
staff of matrons and nurses had been swept off in two days--and the nurses belonging to the
Infirmary had shrunk from being drafted into the pestilential fever-ward--when high wages had
failed to tempt any to what, in their panic, they considered as certain death--when the doctors
stood aghast at the swift mortality among the untended sufferers, who were dependent only on
the care of the most ignorant hirelings, too brutal to recognise the solemnity of Death (all
this had happened within a week from the first acknowledgment of the presence of the plague)--Ruth
came one day, with a quieter step than usual, into Mr Benson's study, and told him she wanted
to speak to him for a few minutes.

This is an atom: 
"To be sure, my dear! Sit down," said he; for she was standing and leaning her head against
the chimney-piece, idly gazing into the fire. She went on standing there, as if she had not
heard his words; and it was a few moments before she began to speak. Then she said:

This is an atom: 
"I want to tell you, that I have been this morning and offered myself as matron to the fever-ward
while it is so full. They have accepted me; and I am going this evening."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, Ruth! I feared this; I saw your look this morning as we spoke of this terrible illness."

This is an atom: 
"Why do you say 'fear,' Mr Benson? You yourself have been with John Harrison, and old Betty,
and many others, I dare say, of whom we have not heard."

This is an atom: 
"But this is so different! in such poisoned air! among such malignant cases! Have you thought
and weighed it enough, Ruth?"

Astonishment at the Effects of Electricity_.

This is an atom: 
Mequinez.

This is an atom: 
I shall now speak of their principal or rather only studies, which are, physic, astrology,
and poetry. First then of physic, to give you an accurate idea of the extent of their knowledge
in which, it will be sufficient to describe their practice of it;
and I am sure you, my dear D----, and every other friend to humanity,
will agree with me, that it would have been better for their
countrymen if they had never attempted it at all, as unassisted
nature would do more, for those afflicted with disease, than such
bunglers.

This is an atom: 
The general practice adopted by the Moorish physicians, or _Tweebs_,
is, bleeding _ad deliquium_ in all fevers; administering excessive
doses of drastic medicines, plenty of emulsions, and a watery diet.

This is an atom: 
They order vinegar in cases of quinsies and ardent fevers, and garlic in those of a putrid,
malignant, and pestilential kind.

This is an atom: 
They prescribe alum in cases of hemorrhage and dysentery; hot spices
and long abstinences in chronic diseases; recent ox-gall to kill
worms and cure dropsies; castor and myrrh in all hysteric affections;
asses milk in slow fevers and consumptions; oranges, honey, eggs,
mint, and myrrh, in cases of typhus; poppy-juice in convulsive
disorders and fluxes of the bowels; pitch or tar water and pennyroyal
in common fevers; rose-leaves in cases of diabetes; and sulphur in
all cutaneous disorders.

This is an atom: 
This is the whole of the Moorish _materia medica_. In simple diseases, where little medical
ability is necessary, and the good habit of body of these people in general contributes to
their success, they may effect a cure; but in desperate cases,
where nothing but the skill of the physician can relieve oppressed
nature, it is not astonishing that they should fail.

This is an atom: 
These men are in some measure astrologers:
most probably, being gifted with a greater degree of cunning than
their neighbours, they have discovered the weak side of their
countrymen, together with their own insufficiency, to cover which
they pretend to a knowledge of the stars, which has the greatest
weight with the superstitious Moors; consequently, when a patient,
either by their improper treatment, or the violence of his disease,
evinces symptoms of approaching dissolution, the doctor, with
infinite gravity, points out to the surrounding relations the star
which, he positively asserts, appears to summon the dying man to
the bosom of his Prophet.

This is an atom: 
By this means he avoids reproach, since he has made it so evident, that the poor man's time was
come, and that nothing could ward off the shafts of destiny. This apparently wonderful faculty
of prognostication, added to their exemplary mode of living, and liberal donations to the
poor and afflicted, operating upon the minds of the blind and fanatic Moors, induces _them_ to
consider their physicians next to their saints, and to worship _them_ with nearly as much
reverence.

This is an atom: 
The Tweebs have each from two to six disciples, whom they instruct and initiate in their
secrets of the healing art.

This is an atom: 
In their regular visits to any town, they parade the streets with great pomp and gravity,
followed by a train of miserable objects, who pretend to have been
recently recovered from a long and dangerous illness by the
extraordinary skill of the doctor; while, in fact, their cadaverous
countenances and emaciated bodies seem to contradict their assertions,
and bear ample testimony that they are hurrying fast to that country,
"from whose bourne no traveller returns."

This is an atom: 
Under the pretence of charity, these poor wretches are supported
by this Moorish Aesculapius, while his views in so doing are entirely
selfish; that by their means he may better impose on the credulous,
and obtain considerable sums of money.

This is an atom: 
When any one of them (by chance) effects what he considers a great
cure, it is communicated in a circular letter to all the doctors
in Barbary.

This is an atom: 
They select one of their elders every year, and appoint him to preside over them. His business,
for the time being, is to settle all their controversies: he is the fountain of all justice
among them; for as they are looked upon to be petty saints, they are a privileged set of men,
and not in the least subject to either civil or military jurisdiction. They possess the art of
taming the monstrous serpents of the country, and rendering them perfectly harmless: in short,
their profession is nothing but a system of the grossest empiricism.

This is an atom: 
"They won't let you have your flowers, I'm afraid," said Miss Benson. "Doctors so often object
to the smell."

This is an atom: 
"No; perhaps not," said Ruth, hurriedly. "I did not think of it. I will only keep this one
rose. Here, Leonard, darling!" She gave the rest to him. It was her farewell; for having now
no veil to hide her emotion, she summoned all her bravery for one parting smile, and, smiling,
turned away. But she gave one look back from the street, just from the last point at which
the door could be seen, and catching a glimpse of Leonard standing foremost on the step, she
ran back, and he met her half-way, and mother and child spoke never a word in that close embrace.

This is an atom: 
"Now, Leonard," said Miss Faith, "be a brave boy. I feel sure she will come back to us before
very long."

This is an atom: 
But she was very near crying herself; and she would have given way, I believe, if she had not
found the wholesome outlet of scolding Sally, for expressing just the same opinion respecting
Ruth's proceedings as she herself had done not two hours before. Taking what her brother had
said to her as a text, she delivered such a lecture to Sally on want of faith that she was
astonished at herself, and so much affected by what she had said that she had to shut the door
of communication between the kitchen and the parlour pretty hastily, in order to prevent Sally's
threatened reply from weakening her belief in the righteousness of what Ruth had done. Her
words had gone beyond her conviction.

This is an atom: 
Evening after evening Mr Benson went forth to gain news of Ruth; and night after night he returned
with good tidings. The fever, it is true, raged; but no plague came nigh her. He said her face
was ever calm and bright, except when clouded by sorrow as she gave the accounts of the deaths
which occurred in spite of every care. He said he had never seen her face so fair and gentle
as it was now, when she was living in the midst of disease and woe.

This is an atom: 
One evening Leonard (for they had grown bolder as to the infection) accompanied him to the
street on which the hospital abutted. Mr Benson left him there, and told him to return home;
but the boy lingered, attracted by the crowd that had gathered, and were gazing up intently
towards the lighted windows of the hospital. There was nothing beyond to be seen; but the greater
part of these poor people had friends or relations in that palace of Death.

This is an atom: 
Leonard stood and listened. At first their talk consisted of vague and exaggerated accounts
(if such could be exaggerated) of the horrors of the fever. Then they spoke of Ruth--of his
mother; and Leonard held his breath to hear.

This is an atom: 
"They say she has been a great sinner, and that this is her penance," quoth one. And as Leonard
gasped, before rushing forward to give the speaker straight the lie, an old man spoke:

This is an atom: 
"Such a one as her has never been a great sinner; nor does she do her work as a penance, but
for the love of God, and of the blessed Jesus. She will be in the light of God's countenance
when you and I will be standing afar off. I tell you, man, when my poor wench died, as no one
would come near, her head lay at that hour on this woman's sweet breast. I could fell you,"
the old man went on, lifting his shaking arm, "for calling that woman a great sinner. The blessing
of them who were ready to perish is upon her."

This is an atom: 
Immediately there arose a clamour of tongues, each with some tale of his mother's gentle doings,
till Leonard grew dizzy with the beatings of his glad, proud heart. Few were aware how much
Ruth had done; she never spoke of it, shrinking with sweet shyness from over-much allusion
to her own work at all times. Her left hand truly knew not what her right hand did; and Leonard
was overwhelmed now to hear of the love and the reverence with which the poor and outcast had
surrounded her. It was irrepressible. He stepped forward with a proud bearing, and touching
the old man's arm who had first spoken, Leonard tried to speak; but for an instant he could
not, his heart was too full: tears came before words, but at length he managed to say:

This is an atom: 
"Sir, I am her son!"

This is an atom: 
"Thou! thou her bairn! God bless you, lad," said an old woman, pushing through the crowd. "It
was but last night she kept my child quiet with singing psalms the night through. Low and sweet,
low and sweet, they tell me--till many poor things were hushed, though they were out of their
minds, and had not heard psalms this many a year. God in heaven bless you, lad!"

This is an atom: 
Many other wild, woe-begone creatures pressed forward with blessings on Ruth's son, while he
could only repeat:

This is an atom: 
"She is my mother."

This is an atom: 
From that day forward Leonard walked erect in the streets of Eccleston, where "many arose and
called her blessed."

This is an atom: 
After some weeks the virulence of the fever abated; and the general panic subsided--indeed,
a kind of fool-hardiness succeeded. To be sure, in some instances the panic still held possession
of individuals to an exaggerated extent. But the number of patients in the hospital was rapidly
diminishing, and, for money, those were to be found who could supply Ruth's place. But to her
it was owing that the overwrought fear of the town was subdued; it was she who had gone voluntarily,
and, with no thought of greed or gain, right into the very jaws of the fierce disease. She
bade the inmates of the hospital farewell, and after carefully submitting herself to the purification
recommended by Mr Davis, the principal surgeon of the place, who had always attended Leonard,
she returned to Mr Benson's just at gloaming time.

This is an atom: 
They each vied with the other in the tenderest cares. They hastened tea; they wheeled the sofa
to the fire; they made her lie down; and to all she submitted with the docility of a child;
and when the candles came, even Mr Benson's anxious eye could see no change in her looks, but
that she seemed a little paler. The eyes were as full of spiritual light, the gently parted
lips as rosy, and the smile, if more rare, yet as sweet as ever.

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXIV

This is an atom: 
"I Must Go and Nurse Mr Bellingham"

This is an atom: 
The next morning, Miss Benson would insist upon making Ruth lie down on the sofa. Ruth longed
to do many things; to be much more active; but she submitted, when she found that it would
gratify Miss Faith if she remained as quiet as if she were really an invalid.

This is an atom: 
Leonard sat by her holding her hand. Every now and then he looked up from his book, as if to
make sure that she indeed was restored to him. He had brought her down the flowers which she
had given him the day of her departure, and which he had kept in water as long as they had
any greenness or fragrance, and then had carefully dried and put by. She too, smiling, had
produced the one rose which she had carried away to the hospital. Never had the bond between
her and her boy been drawn so firm and strong.

This is an atom: 
Many visitors came this day to the quiet Chapel-house. First of all Mrs Farquhar appeared.
She looked very different from the Jemima Bradshaw of three years ago. Happiness had called
out beauty; the colouring of her face was lovely, and vivid as that of an autumn day; her berry-red
lips scarce closed over the short white teeth for her smiles; and her large dark eyes glowed
and sparkled with daily happiness. They were softened by a mist of tears as she looked upon Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"Lie still! Don't move! You must be content to-day to be waited upon, and nursed! I have just
seen Miss Benson in the lobby, and had charge upon charge not to fatigue you. Oh, Ruth! how
we all love you, now we have you back again! Do you know, I taught Rosa to say her prayers
as soon as ever you were gone to that horrid place, just on purpose that her little innocent
lips might pray for you--I wish you could hear her say it--'Please, dear God, keep Ruth safe.'
Oh, Leonard! are not you proud of your mother?"

This is an atom: 
Leonard said "Yes," rather shortly, as if he were annoyed that any one else should know, or
even have a right to imagine, how proud he was. Jemima went on:

This is an atom: 
"Now, Ruth! I have got a plan for you. Walter and I have partly made it; and partly it's papa's
doing. Yes, dear! papa has been quite anxious to show his respect for you. We all want you
to go to the dear Eagle's Crag for this next month, and get strong, and have some change in
that fine air at Abermouth. I am going to take little Rosa there. Papa has lent it to us. And
the weather is often very beautiful in November."

This is an atom: 
"Thank you very much. It is very tempting; for I have been almost longing for some such change.
I cannot tell all at once whether I can go; but I will see about it, if you will let me leave
it open a little."

This is an atom: 
"Oh! as long as you like, so that you will but go at last. And, Master Leonard! you are to
come too. Now, I know I have you on my side."

This is an atom: 
Ruth thought of the place. Her only reluctance arose from the remembrance of that one interview
on the sands. That walk she could never go again; but how much remained! How much that would
be a charming balm and refreshment to her!

This is an atom: 
The trees bear fruit when about seven years old. The berries are gathered green and dried in the
sun.

This is an atom: 
The branches to which the berries are attached are broken off by boys and thrown to girls and
women, who pick off the berries, and take them to the drying places.

This is an atom: 
One tree sometimes bears a hundred pounds.

This is an atom: 
The tree likes the hills and mountains along the sea, a hot climate and a dry atmosphere.

This is an atom: 
THE NUTMEG TREE.

This is an atom: 
The nutmeg tree grows to a height of thirty to fifty feet.

This is an atom: 
The ripe fruit looks somewhat like the apricot on the outside. It bursts in two and shows the
dark nut covered with mace, a bright scarlet. This is stripped off and pressed flat. The shells
are broken open when perfectly dry, and the nuts powdered with lime to prevent the attacks
of worms.

This is an atom: 
The tree bears the sixth or seventh year,--the nuts becoming ripe six months after the flower
appears. Twenty thousand nuts are sometimes gathered from one tree.

This is an atom: 
Other important growths we find to be pepper, which begins to bear
when five years old and may bear for thirty years; the vanilla bean,
which proves to be very profitable when properly cared for; and
cacao, which requires eight years to come to full fruitage, but is
an invaluable plant.

This is an atom: 
MINERALS.

This is an atom: 
Puerto Rico has no mines or minerals of any consequence, except a little iron. Foundries for
magnetic iron have been established at Ponce, San Juan and
Mayaguez.

This is an atom: 
Gold, silver, copper and coal are known to exist in small quantities beneath the surface, but not
in sufficient amount to be mined.

This is an atom: 
The island is well supplied with limestone, which makes an excellent building material. Marble,
also, is easily obtained. Along the coast are occasional marshes where salt is prepared for
market.

This is an atom: 
OUR JOURNEY'S END.
Our month in Puerto Rico is drawing to a close, and the good ship
which is to bear us homeward is waiting in the harbor.
We make a last farewell tour of the shops in San Juan, and buy a
few gifts for the friends at home: a green parrot to please sister;
a tortoise-shell comb for mother; a cane for father, a native hat
for brother, and a calabash drinking bowl for the school museum.
It is with reluctant steps that we make our way to the ship. The
clear sky, the perfect climate, the constant verdure, the wonderful
plants and trees, and the beautiful mountain scenery make Puerto
Rico one of the most attractive lands to be found anywhere.
Although the roads are in a deplorable condition, a new system has
been planned, and will probably be soon completed.I shall never forget the sensation of relief in my mind when she told us
what she proposed to do; but we thought it right to warn her to the full extent--

This is an atom: 
"Nay, madam," said he, catching a glimpse of Ruth's changing colour, "I will spare you any
more praises. I will only say, if I can be a friend to you, or a friend to your child, you
may command my poor powers to the utmost."

This is an atom: 
He got up, and bowing formally, he took his leave. Jemima came and kissed Ruth. Leonard went
upstairs to put the precious letter away. Miss Benson sat crying heartily in a corner of the
room. Ruth went to her and threw her arms round her neck, and said:

This is an atom: 
"I could not tell him just then. I durst not speak for fear of breaking down; but if I have
done right, it was all owing to you and Mr Benson. Oh! I wish I had said how the thought first
came into my head from seeing the things Mr Benson has done so quietly ever since the fever
first came amongst us. I could not speak; and it seemed as if I was taking those praises to
myself, when all the time I was feeling how little I deserved them--how it was all owing to you."

This is an atom: 
"Under God, Ruth," said Miss Benson, speaking through her tears.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! I think there is nothing humbles one so much as undue praise. While he was reading that
letter, I could not help feeling how many things I have done wrong! Could he know of--of what
I have been?" asked she, dropping her voice very low.

This is an atom: 
"Yes!" said Jemima, "he knew--everybody in Eccleston did know--but the remembrance of those
days is swept away. Miss Benson," she continued, for she was anxious to turn the subject, "you
must be on my side, and persuade Ruth to come to Abermouth for a few weeks. I want her and
Leonard both to come."

This is an atom: 
"I'm afraid my brother will think that Leonard is missing his lessons sadly. Just of late we
could not wonder that the poor child's heart was so full; but he must make haste, and get on
all the more for his idleness." Miss Benson piqued herself on being a disciplinarian.

This is an atom: 
"Oh, as for lessons, Walter is so very anxious that you should give way to his superior wisdom,
Ruth, and let Leonard go to school. He will send him to any school you fix upon, according
to the mode of life you plan for him."

This is an atom: 
"I have no plan," said Ruth. "I have no means of planning. All I can do is to try and make
him ready for anything."

This is an atom: 
"Well," said Jemima, "we must talk it over at Abermouth; for I am sure you won't refuse to
come, dearest, dear Ruth! Think of the quiet, sunny days, and the still evenings, that we shall
have together, with little Rosa to tumble about among the fallen leaves; and there's Leonard
to have his first sight of the sea."

This is an atom: 
"I do think of it," said Ruth, smiling at the happy picture Jemima drew. And both smiling at
the hopeful prospect before them, they parted--never to meet again in life.

This is an atom: 
No sooner had Mrs Farquhar gone than Sally burst in.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! dear, dear!" said she, looking around her. "If I had but known that the rector was coming
to call, I'd ha' put on the best covers, and the Sunday tablecloth! You're well enough," continued
she, surveying Ruth from head to foot; "you're always trim and dainty in your gowns, though
I reckon they cost but tuppence a yard, and you've a face to set 'em off; but as for you" (as
she turned to Miss Benson), "I think you might ha' had something better on than that old stuff,
if it had only been to do credit to a parishioner like me, whom he has known ever sin' my father
was his clerk."

This is an atom: 
"You forget, Sally, I have been making jelly all the morning. How could I tell it was Mr Grey
when there was a knock at the door?" Miss Benson replied.

This is an atom: 
"You might ha' letten me do the jelly; I'se warrant I could ha' pleased Ruth as well as you.
If I had but known he was coming, I'd ha' slipped round the corner and bought ye a neck-ribbon,
or summut to lighten ye up. I'se loath he should think I'm living with Dissenters, that don't
know how to keep themselves trig and smart."

This is an atom: 
"Never mind, Sally; he never thought of me. What he came for, was to see Ruth; and, as you
say, she's always neat and dainty."

This is an atom: 
"Well! I reckon it cannot be helped now; but if I buy ye a ribbon, will you promise to wear
it when church-folks come? for I cannot abide the way they have of scoffing at the Dissenters
about their dress."

This is an atom: 
"Very well! we'll make that bargain," said Miss Benson; "and now, Ruth, I'll go and fetch you
a cup of warm jelly."

This is an atom: 
"Oh! indeed, Aunt Faith," said Ruth, "I am very sorry to balk you; but if you're going to treat
me as an invalid, I am afraid I shall rebel."

This is an atom: 
But when she found that Aunt Faith's heart was set upon it, she submitted very graciously,
only dimpling up a little, as she found that she must consent to lie on the sofa, and be fed,
when, in truth, she felt full of health, with a luxurious sensation of languor stealing over
her now and then, just enough to make it very pleasant to think of the salt breezes, and the
sea beauty which awaited her at Abermouth.

This is an atom: 
Mr Davis called in the afternoon, and his visit was also to Ruth. Mr and Miss Benson were sitting
with her in the parlour, and watching her with contented love, as she employed herself in household
sewing, and hopefully spoke about the Abermouth plan.

This is an atom: 
"Well! so you had our worthy rector here to-day; I am come on something of the same kind of
errand; only I shall spare you the reading of my letter, which, I'll answer for it, he did
not. Please to take notice," said he, putting down a sealed letter, "that I have delivered
you a vote of thanks from my medical brothers; and open and read it at your leisure; only not
just now, for I want to have a little talk with you on my own behoof. I want to ask you a favour,
Mrs Denbigh."

This is an atom: 
"A favour!" exclaimed Ruth; "what can I do for you? I think I may say I will do it, without
hearing what it is."

This is an atom: 
"Then you're a very imprudent woman," replied he; "however, I'll take you at your word. I want
you to give me your boy."

This is an atom: 
"Leonard!"

This is an atom: 
"Aye! there it is, you see, Mr Benson. One minute she is as ready as can be, and the next,
she looks at me as if I was an ogre!"

This is an atom: 
"Perhaps we don't understand what you mean," said Mr Benson.

This is an atom: 
"The thing is this. You know I've no children; and I can't say I've ever fretted over it much;
but my wife has; and whether it is that she has infected me, or that I grieve over my good
practice going to a stranger, when I ought to have had a son to take it after me, I don't know;
but, of late, I've got to look with covetous eyes on all healthy boys, and at last I've settled
down my wishes on this Leonard of yours, Mrs Denbigh."

This is an atom: 
Ruth could not speak; for, even yet, she did not understand what he meant. He went on:

This is an atom: 
"Now, how old is the lad?" He asked Ruth, but Miss Benson replied:

This is an atom: 
"He'll be twelve next February."

This is an atom: 
"Umph! only twelve! He's tall and old-looking for his age. You look young enough, it is true."
He said this last sentence as if to himself, but seeing Ruth crimson up, he abruptly changed
his tone.

This is an atom: 
"Twelve, is he! Well, I take him from now. I don't mean that I really take him away from you,"
said he, softening all at once, and becoming grave and considerate. "His being your son--the
son of one whom I have seen--as I have seen you, Mrs Denbigh (out and out the best nurse I
ever met with, Miss Benson; and good nurses are things we doctors know how to value)--his being
your son is his great recommendation to me; not but what the lad himself is a noble boy. I
shall be glad to leave him with you as long and as much as we can; he could not be tied to
your apron-strings all his life, you know. Only I provide for his education, subject to your
consent and good pleasure, and he is bound apprentice to me. I, his guardian, bind him to myself,
the first surgeon in Eccleston, be the other who he may; and in process of time he becomes
partner, and some day or other succeeds me. Now, Mrs Denbigh, what have you got to say against
this plan? My wife is just as full of it as me. Come! begin with your objections. You're not
a woman if you have not a whole bag-full of them ready to turn out against any reasonable proposal."

This is an atom: 
"I don't know," faltered Ruth. "It is so sudden--"

This is an atom: 
"It is very, very kind of you, Mr Davis," said Miss Benson, a little scandalised at Ruth's
non-expression of gratitude.

This is an atom: 
Once a year they make this journey, for the purpose of depositing their eggs in the sand.

This is an atom: 
The sea fisheries are important to the people of Puerto Rico.

This is an atom: 
The coast waters and fresh water streams swarm with fishes of strange shapes and gaudy
colors.

This is an atom: 
Among these are the shad, sardines, Spanish mackerel, dolphins,
flying fish, sting rays and sharks.

This is an atom: 
The sponge, the manatee and the whale are also found near the island.

This is an atom: 
Suppose some one were to ask you to what kingdom the sponge belonged.

This is an atom: 
Could you tell? Many years ago people believed that it belonged to the vegetable kingdom; but
it is now known to belong to the animal kingdom.

This is an atom: 
The animals attach themselves to rocks, shells and other hard substances below water.

This is an atom: 
Mussels, clams and sponges are cultivated to some extent.

This is an atom: 
Mollusks are useful in many other ways than as food.

This is an atom: 
Their shells are used for making buttons, parasol handles and shirt studs.
Sometimes they are used for making roads. Many shiploads of these shells are brought to New York
from Puerto Rico and other parts of the West Indies every year.

This is an atom: 
PLANT LIFE.

This is an atom: 
Puerto Rico seems to us to be one big flower garden.

This is an atom: 
All kinds of fruit grow wild and most wild plants blossom and bear fruit several times a
year.

This is an atom: 
Cultivated fruits, flowers and vegetables are planted several times a year in order that a
fresh supply may always be at hand. Flowers bloom every month of the year, but are most
plentiful in June. Ferns, in some instances, grow to spreading trees, with graceful drooping
fronds.
Many plants have colored leaves which are as brilliant as the flowers
themselves.
[Illustration: BRANCH AND FRUIT OF THE CACAO TREE.]
Everywhere grow trees and shrubs valuable for their fruit or for
their medicinal qualities.
The leading crops are sugar cane, coffee and tobacco. Over one-half
of the exports consists of coffee, and a little less than one-fourth,
of sugar. Cacao and fruits make a large part of the remainder.
[Illustration: A PUERTO RICAN SUGAR MILL.]
Rice forms the chief food of the laboring classes, and this grows,
not on the wet lowlands, as in our country, but on the mountain
sides.
Bananas and plantains are two of the important food products. Next
to these, the yam and the sweet potato form the diet of the
natives.
Among the fruit trees we find cocoanut palms, tamarinds, prickly
pears, guavas, mangoes, bananas, oranges, limes, cacao (or cocao)
trees and lemons.Think, if I allowed your
member to die now, as he might very well, if he had no nurse--how famously Mr Cranworth would
walk over the course!--Where's Mrs Denbigh gone to? I hope I've not frightened her away by
reminding her of Hector O'Brien, and that awful night, when I do assure you she behaved like
a heroine!"

This is an atom: 
As Mr Benson was showing Mr Davis out, Ruth opened the study-door, and said, in a very calm,
low voice:

This is an atom: 
"Mr Benson! will you allow me to speak to Mr Davis alone?"

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson immediately consented, thinking that, in all probability, she wished to ask some
further questions about Leonard; but as Mr Davis came into the room, and shut the door, he
was struck by her pale, stern face of determination, and awaited her speaking first.

This is an atom: 
"Mr Davis! I must go and nurse Mr Bellingham," said she at last, clenching her hands tight
together, but no other part of her body moving from its intense stillness.

This is an atom: 
"Mr Bellingham?" asked he, astonished at the name.

This is an atom: 
"Mr Donne, I mean," said she, hurriedly. "His name was Bellingham."

This is an atom: 
"Oh! I remember hearing he had changed his name for some property. But you must not think of
any more such work just now. You are not fit for it. You are looking as white as ashes."

This is an atom: 
"I must go," she repeated.

This is an atom: 
"Nonsense! Here's a man who can pay for the care of the first hospital nurses in London--and
I doubt if his life is worth the risk of one of theirs even, much more of yours."

This is an atom: 
"We have no right to weigh human lives against each other."

This is an atom: 
"No! I know we have not. But it's a way we doctors are apt to get into; and, at any rate, it's
ridiculous of you to think of such a thing. Just listen to reason."

This is an atom: 
"I can't! I can't!" cried she, with sharp pain in her voice. "You must let me go, dear Mr Davis!"
said she, now speaking with soft entreaty.

This is an atom: 
"No!" said he, shaking his head authoritatively. "I'll do no such thing."

This is an atom: 
"Listen," said she, dropping her voice, and going all over the deepest scarlet; "he is Leonard's
father! Now! you will let me go!"

This is an atom: 
Mr Davis was indeed staggered by what she said, and for a moment he did not speak. So she went on:

This is an atom: 
"You will not tell! You must not tell! No one knows, not even Mr Benson, who it was. And now--it
might do him so much harm to have it known. You will not tell!"

This is an atom: 
"No! I will not tell," replied he. "But, Mrs Denbigh, you must answer me this one question,
which I ask you in all true respect, but which I must ask, in order to guide both myself and
you aright--of course I knew Leonard was illegitimate--in fact, I will give you secret for
secret: it was being so myself that first made me sympathise with him, and desire to adopt
him. I knew that much of your history; but tell me, do you now care for this man? Answer me
truly--do you love him?"

This is an atom: 
For a moment or two she did not speak; her head was bent down; then she raised it up, and looked
with clear and honest eyes into his face.

This is an atom: 
The hunter's gun has caused the disappearance of large numbers of the birds. Those remaining
are found only in the forests.

This is an atom: 
Columbus spoke also of the flocks of parrots "whose bright wings obscured the sun"; but we
seldom see the brilliant plumage of these birds on our excursions.

This is an atom: 
BIRDS.

This is an atom: 
There are said to be about one hundred and fifty kinds of birds on
the island of Puerto Rico.

This is an atom: 
Among these are the mocking bird, the wild canary, the sugar bird,
the thrush, the humming bird, the owl, the hawk, the dove, the
cuckoo, the oriole, the nightingale, and the Guinea bird.

This is an atom: 
During the migrating season, many other birds fly over from other islands.

This is an atom: 
Flamingoes and other water birds are numerous on the coast.

This is an atom: 
There is a parrot market in every port, however, and this is a
popular place of resort.

This is an atom: 
Here are cool trees and drinking stands, or booths, where cocoanut milk and cool drinks are
sold.

This is an atom: 
The birds are not usually confined to cages, but are left to climb
about the booths. The natives love these birds and make great pets
of them. The birds are tame and quite accomplished in the art of
begging. When the passer-by extends his hand, they walk into it for
the sake of the gifts which they know will come.
But the bird which is oftenest seen is the fighting or game-cock.
The streets and market places are full of these. They are the pets
and often the most valued possessions of their owners.
OTHER ANIMAL LIFE.However, come along, and let
us make the best of it. It saves me a deal of trouble, I know; for, if I have you for a right
hand, I need not worry myself continually with wondering how he is taken care of. Go! get your
bonnet, you tender-hearted fool of a woman! Let us get you out of the house without any more
scenes or explanations; I'll make all straight with the Bensons."

This is an atom: 
"You will not tell my secret, Mr Davis," she said, abruptly.

This is an atom: 
"No! not I! Does the woman think I had never to keep a secret of the kind before? I only hope
he'll lose his election, and never come near the place again. After all," continued he, sighing,
"I suppose it is but human nature!" He began recalling the circumstances of his own early life,
and dreamily picturing scenes in the grey dying embers of the fire; and he was almost startled
when she stood before him, ready equipped, grave, pale, and quiet.

This is an atom: 
"Come along!" said he. "If you're to do any good at all, it must be in these next three days.
After that, I'll ensure his life for this bout; and mind! I shall send you home then; for he
might know you, and I'll have no excitement to throw him back again, and no sobbing and crying
from you. But now every moment your care is precious to him. I shall tell my own story to the
Bensons, as soon as I have installed you."

This is an atom: 
Mr Donne lay in the best room of the Queen's Hotel--no one with him but his faithful, ignorant
servant, who was as much afraid of the fever as any one else could be, but who, nevertheless,
would not leave his master--his master who had saved his life as a child, and afterwards put
him in the stables at Bellingham Hall, where he learnt all that he knew. He stood in a farther
corner of the room, watching his delirious master with affrighted eyes, not daring to come
near him, nor yet willing to leave him.

This is an atom: 
"Oh! if that doctor would but come! He'll kill himself or me--and them stupid servants won't
stir a step over the threshold; how shall I get over the night? Blessings on him--here's the
old doctor back again! I hear him creaking and scolding up the stairs!"

This is an atom: 
The door opened, and Mr Davis entered, followed by Ruth.

This is an atom: 
"Here's the nurse, my good man--such a nurse as there is not in the three counties. Now, all
you'll have to do is to mind what she says."

This is an atom: 
"Oh, sir! he's mortal bad! won't you stay with us through the night, sir?"

This is an atom: 
"Look there!" whispered Mr Davis to the man, "see how she knows how to manage him! Why, I could
not do it better myself!"

This is an atom: 
She had gone up to the wild, raging figure, and with soft authority had made him lie down:
and then, placing a basin of cold water by the bedside, she had dipped in it her pretty hands,
and was laying their cool dampness on his hot brow, speaking in a low soothing voice all the
time, in a way that acted like a charm in hushing his mad talk.

This is an atom: 
"But I will stay," said the doctor, after he had examined his patient; "as much on her account
as his! and partly to quieten the fears of this poor, faithful fellow."

This is an atom: 
CHAPTER XXXV

This is an atom: 
Out of Darkness into Light

This is an atom: 
The third night after this was to be the crisis--the turning-point between Life and Death.
Mr Davis came again to pass it by the bedside of the sufferer. Ruth was there, constant and
still, intent upon watching the symptoms, and acting according to them, in obedience to Mr
Davis's directions. She had never left the room. Under arbor and trellis, Full of flutes, full of
flowers, What mad fortunes befell us, What glad orgies were ours!
In the days of our youth, In our festal attire, When the sweet flesh was smooth, When the swift
blood was fire, And all Earth paid in orange and purple to pavilion the bed of Desire!

This is an atom: 
The Sultan's Palace
My spirit only lived to look on Beauty's face, As only when they clasp the arms seem served
aright; As in their flesh inheres the impulse to embrace, To gaze on Loveliness was my soul's
appetite.

This is an atom: 
I have roamed far in search; white road and plunging bow Were keys in the blue doors where my
desire was set; Obedient to their lure, my lips and laughing brow The hill-showers and the
spray of many seas have wet.

This is an atom: 
Hot are enamored hands, the fragrant zone unbound, To leave no dear delight unfelt, unfondled o'er,
The will possessed my heart to girdle Earth around With their insatiate need to wonder and
adore.

This is an atom: 
The flowers in the fields, the surf upon the sands, The sunset and
the clouds it turned to blood and wine, Were shreds of the thin
veil behind whose beaded strands A radiant visage rose, serene,
august, divine.

This is an atom: 
A noise of summer wind astir in starlit trees, A song where sensual love's delirium rose and
fell, Were rites that moved my soul more than the devotee's When from the blazing choir rings
out the altar bell.

This is an atom: 
I woke amid the pomp of a proud palace; writ In tinted arabesque
on walls that gems o'erlay, The names of caliphs were who once held
court in it, Their baths and bowers were mine to dwell in for a
day.
Their robes and rings were mine to draw from shimmering trays --
Brocades and broidered silks, topaz and tourmaline -- Their
turban-cloths to wind in proud capricious ways, And fasten plumes
and pearls and pendent sapphires in.
I rose; far music drew my steps in fond pursuit Down tessellated
floors and towering peristyles:
Through groves of colonnades fair lamps were blushing fruit, On
seas of green mosaic soft rugs were flowery isles.So she covered her
face again, and sank into a whirling stupor of sense and feeling. By-and-by she heard her fellow-watcher
stirring, and a dull wonder stole over her as to what he was doing; but the heavy languor pressed
her down, and kept her still. At last she heard the words, "Come here," and listlessly obeyed
the command. She had to steady herself in the rocking chamber before she could walk to the
bed by which Mr Davis stood; but the effort to do so roused her, and, although conscious of
an oppressive headache, she viewed with sudden and clear vision all the circumstances of her
present position. Mr Davis was near the head of the bed, holding the night-lamp high, and shading
it with his hand, that it might not disturb the sick person, who lay with his face towards
them, in feeble exhaustion, but with every sign that the violence of the fever had left him.
It so happened that the rays of the lamp fell bright and full upon Ruth's countenance, as she
stood with her crimson lips parted with the hurrying breath, and the fever-flush brilliant
on her cheeks. Her eyes were wide open, and their pupils distended. She looked on the invalid
in silence, and hardly understood why Mr Davis had summoned her there.

This is an atom: 
"Don't you see the change? He is better!--the crisis is past!"

This is an atom: 
But she did not speak; her looks were riveted on his softly-unclosing eyes, which met hers
as they opened languidly. She could not stir or speak. She was held fast by that gaze of his,
in which a faint recognition dawned, and grew to strength.

This is an atom: 
He murmured some words. They strained their sense to hear. He repeated them even lower than
before; but this time they caught what he was saying.

This is an atom: 
"Where are the water-lilies? Where are the lilies in her hair?"

This is an atom: 
Mr Davis drew Ruth away.

This is an atom: 
"He is still rambling," said he, "but the fever has left him."

This is an atom: 
The grey dawn was now filling the room with its cold light; was it that made Ruth's cheek so
deadly pale? Could that call out the wild entreaty of her look, as if imploring help against
some cruel foe that held her fast, and was wrestling with her Spirit of Life? She held Mr Davis's
arm. If she had let it go, she would have fallen.

This is an atom: 
"Take me home," she said, and fainted dead away.

This is an atom: 
Mr Davis carried her out of the chamber, and sent the groom to keep watch by his master. He
ordered a fly to convey her to Mr Benson's, and lifted her in when it came, for she was still
half unconscious. It was he who carried her upstairs to her room, where Miss Benson and Sally
undressed and laid her in her bed.

This is an atom: 
He awaited their proceedings in Mr Benson's study. When Mr Benson came in, Mr Davis said:

This is an atom: 
"Don't blame me. Don't add to my self-reproach. I have killed her. I was a cruel fool to let
her go. Don't speak to me."

This is an atom: 
"It may not be so bad," said Mr Benson, himself needing comfort in that shock. "She may recover.
She surely will recover. I believe she will."

This is an atom: 
"No, no! she won't. But by ---- she shall, if I can save her." Mr Davis looked defiantly at
Mr Benson, as if he were Fate. "I tell you she shall recover, or else I am a murderer. What
business had I to take her to nurse him--"

This is an atom: 
He was cut short by Sally's entrance and announcement that Ruth was now prepared to see him.

This is an atom: 
From that time forward Mr Davis devoted all his leisure, his skill, his energy, to save her.
He called on the rival surgeon to beg him to undertake the management of Mr Donne's recovery,
saying, with his usual self-mockery, "I could not answer it to Mr Cranworth if I had brought
his opponent round, you know, when I had had such a fine opportunity in my power. Now, with
your patients, and general Radical interest, it will be rather a feather in your cap; for he
may want a good deal of care yet, though he is getting on famously--so rapidly, in fact, that
it's a strong temptation to me to throw him back--a relapse, you know."

This is an atom: 
The other surgeon bowed gravely, apparently taking Mr Davis in earnest, but certainly very
glad of the job thus opportunely thrown in his way. In spite of Mr Davis's real and deep anxiety
about Ruth, he could not help chuckling over his rival's literal interpretation of all he had said.

This is an atom: 
"To be sure, what fools men are! I don't know why one should watch and strive to keep them
in the world. I have given this fellow something to talk about confidentially to all his patients;
I wonder how much stronger a dose the man would have swallowed! I must begin to take care of
my practice for that lad yonder. Well-a-day! well-a-day! What was this sick fine gentleman
sent here for, that she should run a chance of her life for him? or why was he sent into the
world at all, for that matter?"

This is an atom: 
Indeed, however much Mr Davis might labour with all his professional skill--however much they
might all watch--and pray--and weep--it was but too evident that Ruth "home must go, and take
her wages." Poor, poor Ruth!

This is an atom: 
It might be that, utterly exhausted by watching and nursing, first in the hospital, and then
by the bedside of her former lover, the power of her constitution was worn out; or, it might
be, her gentle, pliant sweetness, but she displayed no outrage or discord even in her delirium.
There she lay in the attic-room in which her baby had been born, her watch over him kept, her
confession to him made; and now she was stretched on the bed in utter helplessness, softly
gazing at vacancy with her open, unconscious eyes, from which all the depth of their meaning
had fled, and all they told was of a sweet, child-like insanity within. From the husks ropes,
brooms, brushes, and bedding are made. The shells are used as lamps, cups, spoons, and scoops.

This is an atom: 
It has been called the poor man's tree because it gives him food, drink, medicine and material
with which to build his home.

This is an atom: 
The tropics could not do without the palm. It is more to that region than the pine is to the
north.

This is an atom: 
THE CALABASH TREE.

This is an atom: 
Another very useful tree to the natives is the calabash, or gourd tree. It provides him with
many household utensils. In height and size it resembles an apple tree. Its leaves are
wedge-shaped and its flowers are large, whitish and fleshy.

This is an atom: 
The fruit is something like a gourd and often a foot in diameter. The shell of the fruit is
so hard that it is not easily broken by rough usage or burnt by exposure to fire. It is used
instead of bottles, cups, basins, dishes, pots and kettles, and
to make musical instruments.

This is an atom: 
Sometimes the calabashes are polished, carved, dyed or otherwise ornamented. The pulp of the fruit
is used as a medicine.

This is an atom: 
THE TRAVELER'S TREE.

This is an atom: 
One of the most curious and beautiful trees on the island is the traveler's tree. It is so named
because it contains in its leaves and at their bases a large
quantity of pure water.

This is an atom: 
By piercing the leaves with a spear or pike the water is drawn out, and found cool and
refreshing.
It often relieves the thirst of the traveler in this warm country.

This is an atom: 
BREAD FRUIT.

This is an atom: 
Among the fruit products used in large quantities are the bread-fruit
and bread-nuts.

This is an atom: 
These trees grow very large and have wide-spreading branches about fifty feet from the ground.

This is an atom: 
The leaves are, very broad, and the fruit looks something like an ovoid osage orange as large
as one's head.

This is an atom: 
[Illustration: BREADFRUIT.]
The fruit is best when picked green, and baked in an oven or in the
ashes, after paring away the outer skin or rind.

This is an atom: 
When done it resembles a browned loaf of bread. It is very good and, wholesome, too; but it tastes
more like baked plantain than bread.

This is an atom: 
The bread-nuts look on the outside like the bread-fruit, but the inside contains a great mass
of closely packed nuts like large chestnuts.

This is an atom: 
These are not good raw, but are fine when baked or boiled.

This is an atom: 
ANNOTTO.

This is an atom: 
We have often heard people speak of butter and cheese being colored,
but did not know that the dairyman was obliged to send to the West
Indies for his dye. The bush which provides it is called the annotto
or annatto. It grows to the size of the quince tree. The leaves are
heart-shaped; and the rosy flowers are followed by fuzzy red-and-yellow
pods, something like chestnut burs.
These small burs are filled with a crimson pulp containing many
seeds. This pulp is immersed in water a few weeks, strained and
boiled to a paste. The paste is made into cakes and dried in the
sun. Then it comes to our country and appears upon our tables in
butter or cheese.
Can you tell me where bay rum comes from? We have often wondered,
and find here an answer to the question. It is furnished by the bay
tree, which grows here. The leaves are distilled and the oil extracted
from them to furnish this perfume for the bath.

This is an atom: 
SPICES.
Spices, in some form, are served every day upon our table; yet few
of us know where they come from, or where, how, or upon what they
grow.
We have heard of the Spice Islands, perhaps, and we just take it
for granted that they all grow there. We are very much surprised,
then, to find many of the spices in Puerto Rico.
ALLSPICE, OR PIMENTO.

This is an atom: 
The pimento spice is native to this soil.He was very much wrapped up in furs and cloaks, and the upper, exposed part of his face was
sunk and hollow, like that of one but partially recovered from illness. Mr and Miss Benson
were at Mr Farquhar's, gone to see Leonard, and poor old Sally had been having a hearty cry
over the kitchen fire before answering the door-knock. Her heart was tenderly inclined just
then towards any one who had the aspect of suffering; so, although her master was out, and
she was usually chary of admitting strangers, she proposed to Mr Donne (for it was he) that
he should come in and await Mr Benson's return in the study. He was glad enough to avail himself
of her offer; for he was feeble and nervous, and come on a piece of business which he exceedingly
disliked, and about which he felt very awkward. The fire was nearly, if not quite, out; nor
did Sally's vigorous blows do much good, although she left the room with an assurance that
it would soon burn up. He leant against the chimney-piece, thinking over events, and with a
sensation of discomfort, both external and internal, growing and gathering upon him. He almost
wondered whether the proposal he meant to make with regard to Leonard could not be better arranged
by letter than by an interview. He became very shivery, and impatient of the state of indecision
to which his bodily weakness had reduced him.

This is an atom: 
Sally opened the door and came in. "Would you like to walk upstairs, sir?" asked she, in a
trembling voice, for she had learnt who the visitor was from the driver of the fly, who had
run up to the house to inquire what was detaining the gentleman that he had brought from the
Queen's Hotel; and, knowing that Ruth had caught the fatal fever from her attendance on Mr
Donne, Sally imagined that it was but a piece of sad civility to invite him upstairs to see
the poor dead body, which she had laid out and decked for the grave, with such fond care that
she had grown strangely proud of its marble beauty.

This is an atom: 
Mr Donne was glad enough of any proposal of a change from the cold and comfortless room where
he had thought uneasy, remorseful thoughts. He fancied that a change of place would banish
the train of reflection that was troubling him; but the change he anticipated was to a well-warmed,
cheerful sitting-room, with signs of life, and a bright fire therein; and he was on the last
flight of stairs,--at the door of the room where Ruth lay--before he understood whither Sally
was conducting him. He shrank back for an instant, and then a strange sting of curiosity impelled
him on. He stood in the humble low-roofed attic, the window open, and the tops of the distant
snow-covered hills filling up the whiteness of the general aspect. He muffled himself up in
his cloak, and shuddered, while Sally reverently drew down the sheet, and showed the beautiful,
calm, still face, on which the last rapturous smile still lingered, giving an ineffable look
of bright serenity. Her arms were crossed over her breast; the wimple-like cap marked the perfect
oval of her face, while two braids of the waving auburn hair peeped out of the narrow border,
and lay on the delicate cheeks.

This is an atom: 
He was awed into admiration by the wonderful beauty of that dead woman.

This is an atom: 
"How beautiful she is!" said he, beneath his breath. "Do all dead people look so peaceful--so
happy?"

This is an atom: 
"Not all," replied Sally, crying. "Few has been as good and as gentle as she was in their lives."
She quite shook with her sobbing.

This is an atom: 
Mr Donne was disturbed by her distress.

This is an atom: 
"Come, my good woman! we must all die--" he did not know what to say, and was becoming infected
by her sorrow. "I am sure you loved her very much, and were very kind to her in her lifetime;
you must take this from me to buy yourself some remembrance of her." He had pulled out a sovereign,
and really had a kindly desire to console her, and reward her, in offering it to her.

This is an atom: 
But she took her apron from her eyes, as soon as she became aware of what he was doing, and,
still holding it midway in her hands, she looked at him indignantly, before she burst out:

This is an atom: 
"And who are you, that think to pay for my kindness to her by money? And I was not kind to
you, my darling," said she, passionately addressing the motionless, serene body--"I was not
kind to you. I frabbed you, and plagued you from the first, my lamb! I came and cut off your
pretty locks in this very room--I did--and you said never an angry word to me;--no! not then,
nor many a time after, when I was very sharp and cross to you.--No! I never was kind to you,
and I dunnot think the world was kind to you, my darling,--but you are gone where the angels
are very tender to such as you--you are, my poor wench!" She bent down and kissed the lips,
from whose marble, unyielding touch Mr Donne recoiled, even in thought.

This is an atom: 
Just then, Mr Benson entered the room. He had returned home before his sister, and come upstairs
in search of Sally, to whom he wanted to speak on some subject relating to the funeral. He
bowed in recognition of Mr Donne, whom he knew as the member for the town, and whose presence
impressed him painfully, as his illness had been the proximate cause of Ruth's death. But he
tried to check this feeling, as it was no fault of Mr Donne's. Sally stole out of the room,
to cry at leisure in her kitchen.

This is an atom: 
"I must apologise for being here," said Mr Donne. "I was hardly conscious where your servant
was leading me to, when she expressed her wish that I should walk upstairs."

This is an atom: 
"It is a very common idea in this town, that it is a gratification to be asked to take a last
look at the dead," replied Mr Benson.

This is an atom: 
"And in this case I am glad to have seen her once more," said Mr Donne. "Poor Ruth!"

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson glanced up at him at the last word. How did he know her name? To him she had only
been Mrs Denbigh. But Mr Donne had no idea that he was talking to one unaware of the connexion
that had formerly existed between them; and, though he would have preferred carrying on the
conversation in a warmer room, yet, as Mr Benson was still gazing at her with sad, lingering
love, he went on:

This is an atom: 
"I did not recognise her when she came to nurse me; I believe I was delirious. My servant,
who had known her long ago, in Fordham, told me who she was. I cannot tell how I regret that
she should have died in consequence of her love of me."

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson looked up at him again, a stern light filling his eyes as he did so. He waited impatiently
to hear more, either to quench or confirm his suspicions. If she had not been lying there,
very still and calm, he would have forced the words out of Mr Donne, by some abrupt question.
As it was, he listened silently, his heart quick-beating.

This is an atom: 
"I know that money is but a poor compensation,--is no remedy for this event, or for my youthful
folly."

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson set his teeth hard together, to keep in words little short of a curse.

This is an atom: 
"Indeed, I offered her money to almost any amount before;--do me justice, sir," catching the
gleam of indignation on Mr Benson's face; "I offered to marry her, and provide for the boy
as if he had been legitimate. It's of no use recurring to that time," said he, his voice faltering;
"what is done cannot be undone. But I came now to say, that I should be glad to leave the boy
still under your charge, and that every expense you think it right to incur in his education
I will defray;--and place a sum of money in trust for him--say, two thousand pounds--or more:
fix what you will. Of course, if you decline retaining him, I must find some one else; but
the provision for him shall be the same, for my poor Ruth's sake."

This is an atom: 
I see no dread in death, no horror to abhor.
I never thought it else than but to cease to dwell Spectator, and
resolve most naturally once more Into the dearly loved eternal
spectacle.

This is an atom: 
Unto the fields and flowers this flesh I found so fair I yield; do
you, dear friend, over your rose-crowned wine, Murmur my name some
day as though my lips were there, And frame your mouth as though
its blushing kiss were mine.

This is an atom: 
Yea, where the banquet-hall is brilliant with young men, You whose bright youth it might have
thrilled my breast to know, Drink . . . and perhaps my lips, insatiate even then Of lips to hang
upon, may find their loved ones so.

This is an atom: 
Unto the flush of dawn and evening I commend This immaterial self and flamelike part of me,
-- Unto the azure haze that hangs at the world's end, The sunshine on the hills, the starlight
on the sea, --
Unto angelic Earth, whereof the lives of those Who love and dream great dreams and deeply feel
may be The elemental cells and nervules that compose Its divine
consciousness and joy and harmony.

This is an atom: 
In that fair capital where Pleasure, crowned Amidst her myriad
courtiers, riots and rules, I too have been a suitor.

This is an atom: 
Radiant eyes Were my life's warmth and sunshine, outspread arms My gilded deep horizons. I
rejoiced In yielding to all amorous influence And multiple impulsion of the flesh, To feel within my
being surge and sway The force that all the stars acknowledge too.Mr Benson was bitterly oppressed with this interview; it disturbed the peace with which he
was beginning to contemplate events. His anger ruffled him, although such anger had been just,
and such indignation well deserved; and both had been unconsciously present in his heart for
years against the unknown seducer, whom he met face to face by the death-bed of Ruth.

This is an atom: 
It gave him a shock which he did not recover from for many days. He was nervously afraid lest
Mr Donne should appear at the funeral; and not all the reasons he alleged to himself against
this apprehension, put it utterly away from him. Before then, however, he heard casually (for
he would allow himself no inquiries) that he had left the town. No! Ruth's funeral passed over
in calm and simple solemnity. Her child, her own household, her friend, and Mr Farquhar, quietly
walked after the bier, which was borne by some of the poor to whom she had been very kind in
her lifetime. And many others stood aloof in the little burying-ground, sadly watching that
last ceremony.

This is an atom: 
They slowly dispersed; Mr Benson leading Leonard by the hand, and secretly wondering at his
self-restraint. Almost as soon as they had let themselves into the Chapel-house, a messenger
brought a note from Mrs Bradshaw, with a pot of quince marmalade, which, she said to Miss Benson,
she thought that Leonard might fancy, and if he did, they were to be sure and let her know,
as she had plenty more; or, was there anything else that he would like? She would gladly make
him whatever he fancied.

This is an atom: 
Poor Leonard! he lay stretched on the sofa, white and tearless, beyond the power of any such
comfort, however kindly offered; but this was only one of the many homely, simple attentions,
which all came round him to offer, from Mr Grey, the rector, down to the nameless poor who
called at the back door to inquire how it fared with _her_ child.

This is an atom: 
Mr Benson was anxious, according to Dissenting custom, to preach an appropriate funeral sermon.
It was the last office he could render to her; it should be done well and carefully. Moreover,
it was possible that the circumstances of her life, which were known to all, might be made
effective in this manner to work conviction of many truths. Accordingly, he made great preparation
of thought and paper; he laboured hard, destroying sheet after sheet--his eyes filling with
tears between-whiles, as he remembered some fresh proof of the humility and sweetness of her
life. Oh, that he could do her justice! but words seemed hard and inflexible, and refused to
fit themselves to his ideas. He sat late on Saturday, writing; he watched through the night
till Sunday morning was far advanced. He had never taken such pains with any sermon, and he
was only half satisfied with it after all.

This is an atom: 
Mrs Farquhar had comforted the bitterness of Sally's grief by giving her very handsome mourning.
At any rate, she felt oddly proud and exulting when she thought of her new black gown; but
when she remembered why she wore it, she scolded herself pretty sharply for her satisfaction,
and took to crying afresh with redoubled vigour. She spent the Sunday morning in alternately
smoothing down her skirts and adjusting her broad hemmed collar, or bemoaning the occasion
with tearful earnestness. And the Whale

A ROUNDABOUT TURN _By Robert H. Charles_
THE NURSERY RHYME BOOK _Edited by Andrew Lang_From the pulpit, Mr Benson saw one and all--the well-filled Bradshaw pew--all in deep mourning,
Mr Bradshaw conspicuously so (he would have attended the funeral gladly if they would have
asked him)--the Farquhars--the many strangers--the still more numerous poor--one or two wild-looking
outcasts, who stood afar off, but wept silently and continually. Mr Benson's heart grew very full.

This is an atom: 
His voice trembled as he read and prayed. But he steadied it as he opened his sermon--his great,
last effort in her honour--the labour that he had prayed God to bless to the hearts of many.
For an instant the old man looked on all the upturned faces, listening, with wet eyes, to hear
what he could say to interpret that which was in their hearts, dumb and unshaped, of God's
doings as shown in her life. He looked, and, as he gazed, a mist came before him, and he could
not see his sermon, nor his hearers, but only Ruth, as she had been--stricken low, and crouching
from sight, in the upland field by Llan-dhu--like a woeful, hunted creature. And now her life
was over! her struggle ended! Sermon and all was forgotten. He sat down, and hid his face in
his hands for a minute or so. Then he arose, pale and serene. He put the sermon away, and opened
the Bible, and read the seventh chapter of Revelations, beginning at the ninth verse.

This is an atom: 
Before it was finished, most of his hearers were in tears. It came home to them as more appropriate
than any sermon could have been. Even Sally, though full of anxiety as to what her fellow-Churchman
would think of such proceedings, let the sobs come freely as she heard the words:

This is an atom: 
And he said to me, These are they which came out of great
   tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them
   white in the blood of the Lamb.

This is an atom: 
As our boys went over the top they were given the
   protection of an aerial squadron. Only those who were
   advancing toward the Hun lines on that day, with full realization
of their duties and their dangers, know what a feeling of protection
these hovering planes gave us.

This is an atom: 
For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall
   feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of
   waters, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

This is an atom: 
"He preaches sermons sometimes," said Sally, nudging Mr Davis, as they rose from their knees
at last. "I make no doubt there was as grand a sermon in yon paper-book as ever we hear in
church. I've heard him pray uncommon fine--quite beyond any but learned folk."

This is an atom: 
Mr Bradshaw had been anxious to do something to testify his respect for the woman, who, if
all had entertained his opinions, would have been driven into hopeless sin. Accordingly, he
ordered the first stonemason of the town to meet him in the chapel-yard on Monday morning,
to take measurement and receive directions for a tombstone. They threaded their way among the
grassy heaps to where Ruth was buried, in the south corner, beneath the great Wych-elm. When
they got there, Leonard raised himself up from the new-stirred turf. His face was swollen with
weeping; but when he saw Mr Bradshaw he calmed himself, and checked his sobs, and, as an explanation
of being where he was when thus surprised, he could find nothing to say but the simple words:

This is an atom: 
"My mother is dead, sir."

This is an atom: 
I thirsted; in cool cups inviting vintage beamed -- Sweet syrups from the South; brown muscat
from the isles.

This is an atom: 
I yearned for passionate Love; faint gauzes fell away.
Pillowed in rosy light I found my heart's desire.
Over the silks and down her florid beauty lay, As over orient clouds
the sunset's coral fire.
Joys that had smiled afar, a visionary form, Behind the ranges hid,
remote and rainbow-dyed, Drew near unto my heart, a wonder soft and
warm, To touch, to stroke, to clasp, to sleep and wake beside.The first time, for years, that he had entered Mr Benson's house, he came leading and comforting
her son--and, for a moment, he could not speak to his old friend, for the sympathy which choked
up his voice, and filled his eyes with tears.

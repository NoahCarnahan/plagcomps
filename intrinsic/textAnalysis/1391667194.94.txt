This is an atom: 
﻿Mr. Snyder derived the utmost enjoyment from the report. He liked the
substance of it, and above all, he was tickled by the bitter tone of
frustration which characterized it. Oakes was baffled, and his knowledge
of Oakes told him that the sensation of being baffled was gall and
wormwood to that high-spirited young man. Whatever might be the result
of this investigation, it would teach him the virtue of patience.

This is an atom: 
He wrote his assistant a short note:

This is an atom: 
Dear Oakes,

This is an atom: 
Your report received. You certainly seem to have got the hard
    case which, I hear, you were pining for. Don't build too much
    on plausible motives in a case of this sort. Fauntleroy, the
    London murderer, killed a woman for no other reason than that
    she had thick ankles. Many years ago, I myself was on a case
    where a man murdered an intimate friend because of a dispute
    about a bet. My experience is that five murderers out of ten
    act on the whim of the moment, without anything which, properly
    speaking, you could call a motive at all.

This is an atom: 
Yours very cordially,
    Paul Snyder

This is an atom: 
P. S. I don't think much of your Pickett theory. However, you're
    in charge. I wish you luck.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
Young Mr. Oakes was not enjoying himself. For the first time in his
life, the self-confidence which characterized all his actions seemed to
be failing him. The change had taken place almost overnight. Soon after
the last livre was spent, De la Salle had occasion to make a journey
in connection with his work. He went on foot, as needs he must, and
begged his way. An old woman gave him a piece of black bread; he
ate it with joy, feeling that now he was indeed a poor man.True, he had only just taken it up, but something told him that, for
all the progress he was likely to make, he might just as well have been
working on it steadily for a month. He was completely baffled. And
every moment which he spent in the Excelsior Boarding-House made it
clearer to him that that infernal old woman with the pale eyes thought
him an incompetent fool. It was that, more than anything, which made
him acutely conscious of his lack of success. His nerves were being
sorely troubled by the quiet scorn of Mrs. Pickett's gaze. He began to
think that perhaps he had been a shade too self-confident and abrupt in
the short interview which he had had with her on his arrival.

This is an atom: 
As might have been expected, his first act, after his brief interview
with Mrs. Pickett, was to examine the room where the tragedy had taken
place. The body was gone, but otherwise nothing had been moved.

This is an atom: 
Oakes belonged to the magnifying-glass school of detection. The first
thing he did on entering the room was to make a careful examination of
the floor, the walls, the furniture, and the windowsill. He would have
hotly denied the assertion that he did this because it looked well, but
he would have been hard put to it to advance any other reason.

This is an atom: 
If he discovered anything, his discoveries were entirely negative, and
served only to deepen the mystery of the case. As Mr. Snyder had said,
there was no chimney, and nobody could have entered through the locked
door.

This is an atom: 
There remained the window. It was small, and apprehensiveness, perhaps,
of the possibility of burglars, had caused the proprietress to make it
doubly secure with an iron bar. No human being could have squeezed his
way through it.

This is an atom: 
It was late that night that he wrote and dispatched to headquarters the
report which had amused Mr. Snyder.

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
Two days later Mr. Snyder sat at his desk, staring with wide, unbelieving
eyes at a telegram he had just received. It read as follows:

This is an atom: 
HAVE SOLVED GUNNER MYSTERY. RETURNING.... OAKES.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Snyder narrowed his eyes and rang the bell. "Send Mr. Oakes to me
directly he arrives," he said.

This is an atom: 
He was pained to find that his chief emotion was one of bitter
annoyance. The swift solution of such an apparently insoluble problem
would reflect the highest credit on the Agency, and there were
picturesque circumstances connected with the case which would make it
popular with the newspapers and lead to its being given a great deal of
publicity.

This is an atom: 
Yet, in spite of all this, Mr. Snyder was annoyed. He realized now how
large a part the desire to reduce Oakes' self-esteem had played with
him. He further realized, looking at the thing honestly, that he had
been firmly convinced that the young man would not come within a mile
of a reasonable solution of the mystery. He had desired only that his
failure would prove a valuable educational experience for him. For he
believed that failure at this particular point in his career would make
Oakes a more valuable asset to the Agency. But now here Oakes was,
within a ridiculously short space of time, returning to the fold, not
humble and defeated, but triumphant. Mr. Snyder looked forward with
apprehension to the young man's probable demeanor under the
intoxicating influence of victory.

This is an atom: 
His apprehensions were well grounded. He had barely finished the third
of the series of cigars, which, like milestones, marked the progress of
his afternoon, when the door opened and young Oakes entered. Mr. Snyder
could not repress a faint moan at the sight of him. One glance was
enough to tell him that his worst fears were realised.

This is an atom: 
"I got your telegram," said Mr. Snyder.

This is an atom: 
Oakes nodded. "It surprised you, eh?" he asked.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Snyder resented the patronizing tone of the question, but he had
resigned himself to be patronized, and keep his anger in check.

This is an atom: 
"Yes," he replied, "I must say it did surprise me. I didn't gather from
your report that you had even found a clue. Was it the Indian theory
that turned the trick?"

This is an atom: 
Oakes laughed tolerantly. "Oh, I never really believed that
preposterous theory for one moment. I just put it in to round out my
report. I hadn't begun to think about the case then--not really think."

This is an atom: 
Mr. Snyder, nearly exploding with wrath, extended his cigar-case.
"Light up, and tell me all about it," he said, controlling his anger.

This is an atom: 
"Well, I won't say I haven't earned this," said Oakes, puffing away. He
let the ash of his cigar fall delicately to the floor--another action
which seemed significant to his employer. As a rule, his assistants,
unless particularly pleased with themselves, used the ashtray.

This is an atom: 
"My first act on arriving," Oakes said, "was to have a talk with Mrs.
Pickett. A very dull old woman."

This is an atom: 
"Curious. She struck me as rather intelligent."

This is an atom: 
"Not on your life. She gave me no assistance whatever. I then examined
the room where the death had taken place. It was exactly as you described
it. There was no chimney, the door had been locked on the inside, and
the one window was very high up. At first sight, it looked extremely
unpromising. Then I had a chat with some of the other boarders. They had
nothing of any importance to contribute. Most of them simply gibbered.
I then gave up trying to get help from the outside, and resolved to rely
on my own intelligence."

This is an atom: 
He smiled triumphantly. "It is a theory of mine, Mr. Snyder, which I
have found valuable that, in nine cases out of ten, remarkable things
don't happen."

This is an atom: 
"I don't quite follow you there," Mr. Snyder interrupted.

This is an atom: 
"I will put it another way, if you like. What I mean is that the simplest
explanation is nearly always the right one. Consider this case. It seemed
impossible that there should have been any reasonable explanation of the
man's death. Most men would have worn themselves out guessing at wild
theories. If I had started to do that, I should have been guessing now.
As it is--here I am. I trusted to my belief that nothing remarkable ever
happens, and I won out."

This is an atom: 
Mr. Snyder sighed softly. Oakes was entitled to a certain amount of
gloating, but there could be no doubt that his way of telling a story
was downright infuriating.

This is an atom: 
And though some curiosity may be aroused by the discovery of that
which has remained hidden, for over two centuries; still, to gratify
that curiosity, many an ingrained idea must be laid aside. Difficult
as it may seem to many, Cromwell at the outset must be regarded not
as 'our heroic One,' but as a man who sold himself to falsehood, that
he might 'ride in gilt coaches, escorted by the flunkeyisms, and most
sweet voices.' Nor to appreciate the secret of our character-test, can
the assertion of any historian, from Clarendon down to Carlyle's
last imitator, be credited, that 'a universal rising of Royalists
combined with Anabaptists' broke out in March 1655.

This is an atom: 
On the contrary, it must be accepted as a preliminary condition in this
investigation that England was, at that time, in a state of immovable
tranquillity, and that any insurrectionary movement during the year
1655 sprang from a far-reaching design, which Cromwell practised
alike on friends, neutrals, and enemies.

This is an atom: 
That this was the case has hitherto escaped notice. Every historian,
who has taken part in the Cromwelliad, regards that revolt as 'a very
tragic reality;' they all agree, that it was 'prevented from
breaking into a dangerous flame by vigilance, prompt action, and
by necessary severity.'

This is an atom: 
That this event might be regarded in a very different light was an idea
far from every one of them. Proof, however, goes before disproof. The
historians should have their say first; and our readers must endure,
for a few moments, what may be termed the received version of the
Insurrection of March 1655.

This is an atom: 
"How can you possibly explain that? You say yourself that the window
was high up."

This is an atom: 
"Nevertheless, it got out by the window. The logical sequence of events
is proof enough that it was in the room. It killed Captain Gunner
there, and left traces of its presence outside. Therefore, as the
window was the only exit, it must have escaped by that route. It may
have climbed or it may have jumped, but somehow it got out of that
window."

This is an atom: 
"What do you mean--it left traces of its presence outside?"

This is an atom: 
"It killed a dog in the backyard behind the house," Oakes said. "The
window of Captain Gunner's room projects out over it. It is full of
boxes and litter and there are a few stunted shrubs scattered about. In
fact, there is enough cover to hide any small object like the body of a
dog. That's why it was not discovered at first. The maid at the
Excelsior came on it the morning after I sent you my report while she
was emptying a box of ashes in the yard. It was just an ordinary stray
dog without collar or license. The analyst examined the body, and found
that the dog had died of the bite of a cobra."

This is an atom: 
"But you didn't find the snake?"

This is an atom: 
"No. We cleaned out that yard till you could have eaten your breakfast
there, but the snake had gone. It must have escaped through the door of
the yard, which was standing ajar. That was a couple of days ago, and
there has been no further tragedy. In all likelihood it is dead. The
nights are pretty cold now, and it would probably have died of
exposure."

This is an atom: 
"But, I just don't understand how a cobra got to Southampton," said the
amazed Mr. Snyder.

This is an atom: 
"Can't you guess it? I told you it came from Java."

This is an atom: 
"How did you know it did?"

This is an atom: 
"Captain Muller told me. Not directly, but I pieced it together from
what he said. It seems that an old shipmate of Captain Gunner's was
living in Java. They corresponded, and occasionally this man would send
the captain a present as a mark of his esteem. The last present he sent
was a crate of bananas. Unfortunately, the snake must have got in
unnoticed. That's why I told you the cobra was a small one. Well,
that's my case against Mr. Snake, and short of catching him with the
goods, I don't see how I could have made out a stronger one. Don't you
agree?"

This is an atom: 
It went against the grain for Mr. Snyder to acknowledge defeat, but he
was a fair-minded man, and he was forced to admit that Oakes did
certainly seem to have solved the impossible.

This is an atom: 
"I congratulate you, my boy," he said as heartily as he could. "To be
completely frank, when you started out, I didn't think you could do it.
By the way, I suppose Mrs. Pickett was pleased?"

This is an atom: 
"If she was, she didn't show it. I'm pretty well convinced she hasn't
enough sense to be pleased at anything. However, she has invited me to
dinner with her tonight. I imagine she'll be as boring as usual, but
she made such a point of it, I had to accept."

This is an atom:

This is an atom: 
For some time after Oakes had gone, Mr. Snyder sat smoking and
thinking, in embittered meditation. Suddenly there was brought the card
of Mrs. Pickett, who would be grateful if he could spare her a few
moments. Mr. Snyder was glad to see Mrs. Pickett. He was a student of
character, and she had interested him at their first meeting. There was
something about her which had seemed to him unique, and he welcomed
this second chance of studying her at close range.

This is an atom: 
She came in and sat down stiffly, balancing herself on the extreme edge
of the chair in which a short while before young Oakes had lounged so
luxuriously.

This is an atom: 
"How are you, Mrs. Pickett?" said Mr. Snyder genially. "I'm very glad
that you could find time to pay me a visit. Well, so it wasn't murder
after all."

This is an atom: 
"Sir?"

This is an atom: 
"I've just been talking to Mr. Oakes, whom you met as James Burton,"
said the detective. "He has told me all about it."

This is an atom: 
"He told _me_ all about it," said Mrs. Pickett dryly.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Snyder looked at her inquiringly. Alban's was founded by Abbot Paul,
a kinsman of Archbishop Lanfrance, when the great Abbey had already
existed for three centuries.

This is an atom: 
Paul became Abbot eleven years after the Conquest, and he showed
himself an able and earnest administrator.

This is an atom: 
Oakes, in his hour of triumph, surely did not deserve this
sweeping condemnation.

This is an atom: 
"Did not Mr. Oakes' solution of the mystery satisfy you, Mrs. Pickett?"

This is an atom: 
"No!"

This is an atom: 
"It struck me as logical and convincing," Mr. Snyder said.

This is an atom: 
"You may call it all the fancy names you please, Mr. Snyder. But Mr.
Oakes' solution was not the right one."

This is an atom: 
"Have you an alternative to offer?"

This is an atom: 
Mrs. Pickett tightened her lips.

This is an atom: 
"If you have, I should like to hear it."

This is an atom: 
"You will--at the proper time."

This is an atom: 
"What makes you so certain that Mr. Oakes is wrong?"

This is an atom: 
"He starts out with an impossible explanation, and rests his whole case
on it. There couldn't have been a snake in that room because it
couldn't have gotten out. The window was too high."

This is an atom: 
"But surely the evidence of the dead dog?"

This is an atom: 
Mrs. Pickett looked at him as if he had disappointed her. "I had always
heard _you_ spoken of as a man with common sense, Mr. Snyder."

This is an atom: 
"I have always tried to use common sense."

This is an atom: 
"Then why are you trying now to make yourself believe that something
happened which could not possibly have happened just because it fits in
with something which isn't easy to explain?"

This is an atom: 
Certainly the event proved that the Abbot was right, and it was to
this judicious removal of a student and man of letters to his
proper home that we owe so much of our knowledge of those interesting
minutiæ of English history which the writer has revealed.

This is an atom: 
"You speak as if you had found it," chided Mr. Snyder.

This is an atom: 
"I have." Mrs. Pickett leaned forward as she spoke, and stared at him
defiantly.

This is an atom: 
Mr. Snyder started. "_You_ have?"

This is an atom: 
"Yes."

This is an atom: 
"What is it?"

This is an atom: 
"You will know before tomorrow. In the meantime try and think it out
for yourself. A successful and prosperous detective agency like yours,
Mr. Snyder, ought to do something in return for a fee."

This is an atom: 
There was something in her manner so reminiscent of the school teacher
reprimanding a recalcitrant pupil that Mr. Snyder's sense of humor came
to his rescue. "We do our best, Mrs. Pickett," he said. "But you
mustn't forget that we are only human and cannot guarantee results."

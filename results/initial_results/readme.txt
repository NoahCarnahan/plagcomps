Data generated using the first 120 files from our training set (contained in training_set_files.txt).
Each of the following features was used in isolation as the only feature:
- average word length
- average sentence length
- average word frequency class
- punctuation percentage
- stopword percentage

The results for these trials are stored first_training_set_test.csv.

Finally, we also tested the first 120 files using all features at once.
The results from these trials are stored in full_set_first_training_test.csv.
